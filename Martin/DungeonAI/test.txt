<BOS> “It’s almost time. Get ready, kid,” Seth whispers, his two blades at each hand. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey! What the hell are you doing? You need to start slinging spells at those orcs!” the driver shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> He looks you over, the initial sneer on his face softening somewhat. "You aren't a secret worshiper of the blood gods, are you?" <EOS>
<BOS> They may be a small group, but this temple is where their magic is the most powerful and you’re getting to witness a lot of it first hand, you’re just glad you’re not on the receiving end. <EOS>
<BOS> Warts vomits all over your legs and boots. You’re about to yell at him, but then you soon see what’s caused all this excitement from him in the first place. Several people in red robes are shouting and running after him, and now most likely you too now that they’ve seen you. <EOS>
<BOS> In any case there’s two more bodies to your count now. Granted Graham deserved it, but that merc…well he made a living risking his life, it just happened that today his time was up. You had to survive a dangerous situation and that’s it. <EOS>
<BOS> As for you and the League, it’s been a war of attrition indeed and you curse the fact that you allowed yourself to get wrapped up in this in the first place, but then again who knows if this wouldn’t have happened eventually anyway and at least the Joachimites will no longer plague the city. <EOS>
<BOS> You pick Kol up in one arm and walk over to the bodies of the traitors who are indeed dead. A little further up though you see Gertrude still moving a little and groaning. You quicken your pace and stop her from trying to get in a shot at you as her last act. <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad to finally see you here. How are things in Jicol?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not sure what to say. Anything I say, you’re not going to like.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> You and your sister laugh and sit down at a secluded table to catch up. <EOS>
<BOS> “Threats of violence. Nice. I can’t believe I recently cried over you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well Warts don’t know the whole fucking story.” <EOS>
<BOS> The next morning you decide you need to get even further away. Like completely off the mainland. The problem is you have no idea what really lies across the water. You know pirates are raiding something because you’ve heard the stories. Of course the problem with that is you’re not looking for some place to just stop and plunder. You’re looking for a place of relative civilization of where you can get your bearings before deciding what to do with the rest of your life as well as getting away from your demon spawn girlfriend. <EOS>
<BOS> On your way there, you half think you’re being followed the entire time, so you do a lot of back tracking and take side streets until you reach your destination. <EOS>
<BOS> “And fuck. Probably a lot of fucking. Look, sounds like you’re having some nice dreams, but dreams aren’t real and with some of the ones you’ve described they sound impossible. Just go back to fucking that whore that dresses like her, it’s the closest you’re going to get.” <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t know if Heather is using some sort of magic on you after all, or she’s just that good, either way she knows what the hell she’s doing and you’re completely at ease and able to ignore the weird chanting of Flynn and his people. <EOS>
<BOS> “Right, because this is such a great position to be in.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait. You’re…you’re saying I’m actually here? I traveled back in fucking time?! Bullshit, this has to be an illusion!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What do you mean?” <EOS>
<BOS> You don't know anything about mermaids other than a few tales you've heard. You would ask one of the other crew members, but they don't seem all that talkative to the likes of you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit…do you really have to Madeline? I mean I know it would be difficult, but I’m willing to go back to the way things were with…” you start to say before you get a punch to your face. It feels like being hit by a piece of steel, but immediately after Madeline goes in to kiss you and even cries a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera nods and leaves to go presumably talk to Zamed. Meanwhile you’ve got to get ready for your first trip aboard a ship. <EOS>
<BOS> "I hoped to find you here," you say, glancing at the menu to see if there is anything you can afford. A baked potato, perhaps? <EOS>
<BOS> The Master of Archives ignores him and flies down the dark staircase. Brother Samuel does his best to follow quickly. The narrow staircase leads into an even narrower hallway and finally to an open room. Several single-bodied cells are against the sidewalls. Samuel gulps and tries to ignore them. The wisp leads him through rows of cells before arriving at a series of pedestals, five of them arranged around a summoning circle. <EOS>
<BOS> On his final words, Brother Samuel gives you a gentle nudge towards the portal. Hundreds of feet in the air, you take in your surroundings. The hills in front are littered with soldiers. Smoke rises now from several locations in the monastery, your home. There is but one path in front of you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, Warts gave me that as a house warming gift. Didn’t like the ugly thing at first, but eh, it’s sort of grown on me now.” <EOS>
<BOS> The few Felians still left have managed to bring Shade back from the brink of death, but he’s a mess, what with burns all over his body and the fact he previously pre-maturely aged himself. This war has cost him quite dearly. You actually don’t think he’ll live too much longer or if he does, he’s going to be spending the rest of his days as a cripple. However, apparently he’s pleased that this was a “win.” He even manages to say a genuine statement of gratitude. Saying that the Temple of Fel will come to the aid of the Nocturnal League if you ever need it. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera smiles a bit and grabs at the obvious bulge in your pants. You nearly don’t back away. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, looks like you’re in the clear for now. Follow him inside and if you survive your meeting with Rook and he okays it, then you’ll get your weapons back.” The lead Shadow Blade says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, think wez gettin’ close. Should be a secret wall around here from what I heard.” Warts says and begins pushing on the wall nearby. <EOS>
<BOS> “So? If he gets caught he could still blab his mouth about our secret hideout.” <EOS>
<BOS> So for better or worse you’ll put up with her. (For now) <EOS>
<BOS> You make your way out of the Thieves’ Guild as quick as you can, into the sewers and to the closest manhole cover. One thing you aren’t going to miss and that’s mucking around in the damn sewers. <EOS>
<BOS> Also makes you appreciate some of the songs your sister made up in her spare time. Granted you never were much into some of the songs she wrote, but even when she was sixteen she was writing shit a lot better (and certainly playing a lot better) than some of these so called bards around here. Hopefully she’s doing well, wherever she is. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s…sort of fucked up Vera” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, maybe I’m wrong. Maybe you can take them alone. You’re obviously in full control of yourself, what with putting a mere mortal like me in my place and all. No need for my help anymore. I see that now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So why stick around?” <EOS>
<BOS> “YOU! I knew you were an infidel, but I didn’t know you’d thrown your lot in with the blasphemous shadow worshippers! No matter, you too shall face the righteous justice of…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure, but unless you’re someone of importance, or have connections or something, they’ll probably just take it from youz anyway. ‘Specially with as fancy as that one you got is. Never seen one like yers before. Youz not really a down on your luck traveller from a small town are you?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wasn’t their fault? Some of them were the ones who killed Camid!” you exclaim and move towards Madeline, but Zal holds you back. <EOS>
<BOS> “LOOK, this is NOT going to…” <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t think so, I’ve never been to Klyton.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey! Haven’t seen you here in a long time! How’s the scourge of the Ebony Claw?” the madam asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You feel a hot burn on the right side of your head before you tumble out of the carriage. It takes you a moment to actually realize you haven’t suffered a fatal wound, but only a “graze” that’s taken off your right ear and skin. <EOS>
<BOS> “FOOL! IF YOU WANT THE SACRED TREASURES OF GALPATIS SO BAD THEN EXPERIENCE ITS TRUE GLORY!” The voice booms and suddenly you’re falling towards the city! <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah. Shame you couldn’t return the favor.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Haunted cabin? Why the hell are we going near it then?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Better damn well be. Well? Get in your circle if you want to assist!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Bah, stop thinking about her. You’re better off. She probably went back home a lot richer than I am right now.” You mutter to yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, yeah. I think I’m okay right now Gwen.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I am not,” you confirm. “What happened here?” <EOS>
<BOS> Heather and her much smaller group are already there to meet the Felians. <EOS>
<BOS> “So, busted with twenty vials of Blue Dream eh?” he asks in a low tone. <EOS>
<BOS> With those last words all of you march towards the temple. The few wanderers still outside in the area immediately go find shelter when they see a group of mean looking hobgoblins and Felians walking down the street. <EOS>
<BOS> “I see. Glad we could entertain I guess.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So, are you going to be the one to speak with Jake? Because it sure isn’t going to be me. That asshole has gone completely barmy and I’m not risking my life if he’s feeling a little blood thirsty.” Tom says. <EOS>
<BOS> You mostly pass the rest of the time observing the scenery as you travel through Hegglesberg and farmlands. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wow, I would think you’d want everyone you could get. I mean there aren’t many of you after all.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Not really, unless you want to leave the city entirely.” <EOS>
<BOS> “The more the merrier,” Seth answers, shoving Wren into a nearby tent. You, Richard, and the woman follow closely behind. Seth straps Wren to a chair in the center of the tent, hands behind the backrest. Richard stands near the tent entrance holding the bound woman as if a parent watching a child’s leashed pet. <EOS>
<BOS> “Isn’t there something I can do to stop this?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> And that you really need to invest in a flintlock. You’re done with this wrestling around on the floor with a knife shit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes I did! She said she couldn’t believe I was still alive and that I had to be the idiot bastard son of Yag eternally blessed with more luck than actual ability.” <EOS>
<BOS> Your people go a little further and soon discover that there are tunnels going in several different directions. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'll keep that in mind. I'll be back tomorrow, you just have the deed." <EOS>
<BOS> “What difference does it make? Not like any of the people around are going to stop us anyway.” The third adds. <EOS>
<BOS> “Great, I’m anxious to get back. They’re probably going to be surprised to see me, but believe me, I’m gonna have my own questions of why they didn’t come get me sooner! Now let me go over how to act and the boss’ personality just so you’re prepared…” <EOS>
<BOS> You can see several of the others are awake now, too, by the glint of lantern light off the whites of their eyes. <EOS>
<BOS> You continue looking around as Vaughn gives Rob a bit of praise about his work on the project. Meanwhile Zalmora finds something to analyze. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm. Certainly was. Never thought I’d ever be directly in the presence of royalty before. Well not without my hands and feet in chains at least.” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “That vicious huh?” <EOS>
<BOS> You and Annah make your way back towards the road and now you’re looking around more than ever. You continue to keep aware of your surroundings by keeping an ear out for various sounds. You still have this idea that you’re suddenly going to hear Teckleville watchmen on horses galloping on your position. <EOS>
<BOS> As much as Tom as been telling half-truths and outright bullshit, he’s sort of right in that you don’t really have much to lose. You’re already an outlaw from your own home and everything you own is on your person and that isn’t much. Not to mention you probably would have lied to gain help in the same situation. <EOS>
<BOS> You sit up a bit from your chair and lean in on your desk. <EOS>
<BOS> As the two of you walk through the city, you find a crowd in blue is roughly headed in your same direction, making your progress slow. <EOS>
<BOS> You help Virgil up off the floor and begin to help him out his room. No sooner have you started doing this when you hear a bunch of noise followed by shouting. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh fuck you asshole. You think you’re better than me? Your girlfriend obviously didn’t think so since she wised up and left your ass.” Randi says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, then he must be rolling well for you every time. Perhaps it is luck that drives success in this city after all. Strategy, logic and even simple might seem to eventually fail in this city. This place is has always been problematic ever since the late Baron Vlad Varsakken declared his independence from Delantium. Even when we had a chapter here, it was always the least profitable of all of our holdings even with all the corruption going on, so when the leadership finally collapsed here and the rest of the lower ranks scattered to the winds. People higher than myself decided to wash their hands of the whole thing, not unlike the Delantium Kingdom did before I guess. However, things change and one of those changes is you sharing in your obvious success.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Really? I figured you for a loner.” Tom says. <EOS>
<BOS> Resigned to your situation, you spend the remainder of your time learning some of the language to crudely communicate with the guards or other prisoners. You learn manage to learn a few things that your sister would find very interesting seeing as she did read a few things about Galpatis. Your chances of ever telling her are nil of course. Still, you hope she’s doing a lot better than you currently are. <EOS>
<BOS> The last event was two farspan relay race, where each horse was stationed at intervals and to pass a hoop to the next. Here, at last, Rom succeeded! His horses saw it as a great game, and worked together, leading Crash Velvet to cross the finish line several horse lengths before Burro's lead horse. <EOS>
<BOS> The shrapnel hits back wheel of the carriage and shatters a portion of it. The carriage manages to continue for a second before the back wheel’s structure is completely destroyed and soon the carriage tips over on its side. The horses drag the carriage a bit longer, before the harness breaks and they’re free of the wreck. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, but…wait a minute. What about that merchant ship that Marco just brought in?” <EOS>
<BOS> “You know what I mean, monk. They could have been stopped if you said something,” King Aeric says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “About what? I told you I’d think about your proposal.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well you can never be completely sure about these things, but we’ll keep our guard up as usual and keep an extra special eye on Kol just in case. Maybe Grayhaze has something for that. We need to go to her anyway and get a ring enchanted to block out Fel again.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What the fuck, I thought nobody else here was organized!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “Please! Help me out of this circle!” you suddenly hear. <EOS>
<BOS> You look over at Zal who is currently bent over looking through a chest. <EOS>
<BOS> Life hasn’t been bad here in Jicol. You still participate in the occasional breaking and entering every now and then, but nowadays you mostly make a living racing your qweepa. Occasionally dice and cards too, but Swifty is a sure thing. Never thought you’d be a rodent racer, but here you are. <EOS>
<BOS> “You aren’t yelling and screaming, I trust you’re not mad?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m sure, but I’m not interested…” <EOS>
<BOS> But though the staff pulls you to hurry, you hesitate in your steps. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya, I really don’t know what you want from me at this point. I mean I’m really trying my best. I thought we were at least getting along.” <EOS>
<BOS> “A lone man, who might be able to turn me into ash with a flick of a finger and has who knows whatever else in his home. Assuming I even go for this, why do I need you to come along again? I didn’t realize you were actually a thief, figured you were more of an opportunistic scavenger.” <EOS>
<BOS> You and your people turn back and proceed to climb back up to the ground floor where the Jicol Watchmen are still milling about. <EOS>
<BOS> “So, Mr. ideas, what exactly were you going to bring up to Tom as far as changes and such?” Zal asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm. Well he certainly might have lasted longer. You act like a mad dog, you’ll eventually get put down like one.” <EOS>
<BOS> You recover just in time to see Klint hovering near her body. She’s lying up against the door of Jasmine’s shop looking a little crumpled. <EOS>
<BOS> The worst of it is whatever is happening to Heather isn’t just expressing itself with bodily excretions, Heather’s magical powers are also starting to go wild. Her nails that were digging into your flesh now feel like hot coals as you can see her hands starting to glow a red color. <EOS>
<BOS> “And as for you, your best option would be running far away from this place and from me before it gets worse. I don’t care how much you THINK you’re in love with me.” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes, I believe there is some sort of department that takes care of all that stuff. We should probably get married first though." Zal remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Without another word, the masked woman begins to take her clothes off. <EOS>
<BOS> “I believe he’s probably due in a week or so. He’s been getting sort of predictable as of late.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t look down, don’t look down,” you quietly repeat to yourself. The wind carries most of the words away from you. You find the climb isn't too difficult, though you're careful to preserve your energy. The last place you want to lose muscle strength is on a cliffside. The irony pops into your mind as you continue to climb; for whatever reason, fate seems to have you climb towards Seth. You definitely prefer the rope. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh fuck!” you say <EOS>
<BOS> “What about them? I mean he’ll continue to have those. That’s a separate issue.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why not? The Delantium Kingdom has a very well established university; even Klyton has a small one. Surely a city as large as Holgard is worthy of one.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Doubt it. He was still very dedicated to Fel even if he wasn’t a stickler for doctrine.” <EOS>
<BOS> Vera nods and slowly throws away her blades and her own flintlock far enough away that she wouldn’t reach them in time. You thought you were going to be far angrier about all this, but now you’re almost feeling pity, but maybe that’ll change when you question her. <EOS>
<BOS> You follow, finding yourself in a large room draped with curtains on one side. A hand grabs your shoulder before you can move. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, youz stealthy, youz a liar and I saw ya kill someone without hesitation. Youz no doubt a rogue, possibly even an assassin, but you seem a little young to have been one of those for very long. In any case, you’ll be able to hone whatever skill you do have. Just don’t piss off the Ebony Claw Syndicate in the process.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you get to the city gates, you find them to be heavily guarded and you’re stopped. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah I was thinking about other potential avenues of revenue too and while I know you were against it before, I REALLY think we should go into it now…” <EOS>
<BOS> You barely manage to stand yourself up and you nearly fall over several times as you hold your head and try to get out danger. Blood covers one side of your face and you can still feel some of it dripping from the hole where your ear used to be. <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t even sure how you feel about it. What caused this radical transformation? You can somewhat guess that perhaps Yinen never quite got over his experience of getting captured by the Neroth cultists. His return to his Joachimite upbringing to the point of zealotry was the result. <EOS>
<BOS> "I don't think Scales is even alive anymore, if he was even lurking down in the sewers to begin with. I think Tom was the only one who was ever convinced of it. I mean we were in the sewers for years and never ran afoul of a supposedly territorial lizard. (Sigh) Alright, I'll go see Mr. Reynolds tomorrow and see what the price is." <EOS>
<BOS> “Fel will now forgive the transgressions of my temple for breaking away from the true faith and embrace me as a proper member of the fold. Fel will become a power once again in this city.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well he’s a pirate, of course he’s not trust worthy, but he’s had the most experience with doing privateer work for the Delantium Kingdom, so he’d probably be able to organize a small group of ships to harass our enemies effectively. Of course it would be very expensive to secure their reliability.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I sort of figured you’d be gone when I woke up.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “You will tell me the knowledge I seek,” Samuel commands. He holds out his arm in focus. Blinding light fires from his open palm searing Ragar’s cheek. Ragar grimaces in pain and attempts to resist. The magic seals surrounding the summoning chamber amplifies the divine magic. The ray from Samuel’s palm grows brighter. <EOS>
<BOS> Never occurred to you that Rook was the one Sneaks was talking about when he said he stabbed an EC lieutenant in the eye once. <EOS>
<BOS> "What the hell do you think..." You start to shout, but then you stop and then calm yourself before continuing. <EOS>
<BOS> “You find that in this line of work, optimism helps keep you going at times, which is why I’m also optimistic that when the time comes you WILL see the advantage of joining US.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, and what if they had been a little braver and called the bluff OR shit, one of them had a flintlock of their own?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Now I know this is all very emotional for you, but I think you’re smart enough to see that I know what the hell I’m talking about on this subject. And if that doesn’t convince you, then consider this. By participating in this ritual, you’ll be free of Tanya’s grip on you. No longer will you feel the loss of her presence and better yet, you’ll be able to love another without putting their life in danger. Doesn’t that alone sound worthwhile? And I’m not even counting the help I will give you against the Joachimites. So you see, there is no downside to this deal.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I…I never…I never…” <EOS>
<BOS> They are waiting for you, my Emperor. <EOS>
<BOS> Later, as you head back to the town to procure a ride for your journey, you count what you have made. Fifty silver coins! A very respectable haul, five times as much as your usual tale would gain in the main town. But how far will it get you? <EOS>
<BOS> “Duly noted, but that’s not really helpful right now. What we need to do is go find someone with more magical knowledge than you or I to look at Kol.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You worry too much, I’m severely broken anyway. If I had embraced all this years before when my mother first approached me, then you might have cause for concern. However, there’s still too much ugh…mortal in me. I am forever going to be at war with myself, though perhaps it’s this internal struggle and late blooming that’s causing my rapid transformation and surge in power. I look at you for example and still feel love. I shouldn’t, but I do. I even hate myself a little for being so weak, but at the same time I don’t care. All these conflicting thoughts and torment are probably helping me be a better infernal because hatred, even self-hatred is a great quality to have as an infernal.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, from here, we go…dis way…no wait dis way…I think…” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> “So? What, do you think I’m going to suddenly attack you or something? Even if I had the strength to grab you from between the bars and choked you out or something, that wouldn’t exactly help my situation now would it? If anything it would just be harder to beg for water from the next person that passed by given that your corpse would be near my cage.” <EOS>
<BOS> Your life was ended by mermaids. <EOS>
<BOS> “Then you’re safe son. You aren’t going to get randomly hassled. You just look like another young wanderer. Just keep your head down around the law and you should be fine. Was there anything else?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I need you back in Jicol where you can keep an eye on things there. Also, I want to make sure if shit goes really bad here, this organization will still exist in some form at least and there will be somewhere to retreat to. If possible try to convince some of those pirates you deal with not to join Zamed’s flotilla. I hope you weren’t too attached to him.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you kidding me Vera? You didn’t see what they were trying to extort from us. Besides, we’ve been okay so far and they haven’t even suddenly tried to raise the rate.” <EOS>
<BOS> You pay for your one room and the pair of you head to it. <EOS>
<BOS> You proceed to tell Rob that you're just looking to hollow out an underground area to serve as the Crimson Talon headquarters right now and it doesn't have to be fancy. It just needs to be structurally sound. You tell him by that time, you'll probably have gotten a hold of some other engineers that can help Rob if he doesn't feel up to the more complex task of building that underground city. <EOS>
<BOS> "Exactly. I'm saying maybe it's time for us to stop worrying about that." <EOS>
<BOS> “You could probably work on that, but that’s beside the point. I’m just saying you could be doing better. Sometimes I think you’re content on being a near do well.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I was taking it anyway, such as it is. Damn, guess Yinen was right about Neroth cultists though. Just one more fucked up thing in this city. Probably best if I don’t tell him where I got these bottles of wine.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, I figured some of you would feel that way, so think of this as my retirement as head of the Crimson Talons. Camid, if you want the job you got it. If not, well I'm sure those of you who still want to go out and do illegal shit can decide who's going to run the organization. Good luck to you." <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t know where the hell you are, but you’re guessing it must be a park of some sort inside the city. You need to find a secluded place and get your bearings. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh, she's a little rich girl that likes slumming. Likes to watch the bum fights and get high on Yellow Devil. The usual. Oh and we fuck sometimes." <EOS>
<BOS> A bit of time passes before you hear Mr. Scars speak to you. <EOS>
<BOS> You repeat the process and by the time a week passes you’re experiencing the thoughts even less. Now Vera isn’t even showing up. Oddly some of the whores still are, but again it’s very minor. You aren’t thinking about Tanya either. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m afraid that will NOT suffice!” Garrick exclaims before Tanya tackles him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I have to say, you came through. Got those elven bitches to agree to perform here once a month. With as many people that were here last night I made more money than I have in a month. Consider your rent lowered.” Hank remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “What do you mean ‘you had not hoped for any survivors’?!?” you reply in awe, “Are you saying you did this to my village?!?” <EOS>
<BOS> Without another word, Madeline starts stripping off your clothing. You’re really not in any condition to stop her, though you do try to feebly get away once. (Which results in another punch) Madeline being a succubus easily manages to get you “ready” and then positions herself on top of your dick and begins to grind against you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Dey ain’t gonna last long against dem purity fanatics. They’re worse than those Neroth cultists were and there is a lot more of dem.” Warts adds. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well she must be okay, because we wuz still gettin’ da cut from her even last month.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, you wouldn’t happen to have any extra water would you?” you suddenly hear one of the slumping figures in the cage say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright, assuming I take you up on your generous offer, how much is it?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Nah, I’d never do that to you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I guess we’ll see, now fuck me like it’s my last night here, because it might very well be.” <EOS>
<BOS> "(Sigh) I really need to get the hell out of these sewers. I'm the damn head of a budding criminal empire. One of those tavern gambling rooms is getting turned into a new office." You say to yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> Captain Rifiv at this point starts ranting in general as he goes back to his quarters. Meanwhile a few of the crew roll their eyes and mutter to themselves. <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well. I believe you are being foolish about all this, but then those that do not follow Dorna are often mere babes in their cribs when it comes to greater wisdom. I certainly hope you do change your mind, but if you do come here again, you had best make sure you are VERY certain to go through with it. I will not be so understanding on a second intrusion. Heather, escort our guest out.” <EOS>
<BOS> King Aeric addresses the new speaker. “Mordecai, you’ve remained quiet until now. Tell me what you think.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shade, YOU told me to seek their aid if possible and I got it. What more do you want?” <EOS>
<BOS> "I must see this for myself!" She named Burro stablemaster, for his horses had performed well overall, but asked Rom to see his horses and game on the morrow. Delighted to watch the horses enjoying themselves and how the people loved them, she gave Rom permission to continue. "This is a novel idea," she said, "but the racing horses cannot spend all their time here; they must train as well. But once a week they may play, to raise their spirits, and the retired racers as well." <EOS>
<BOS> “Grm. Okay, sure these will do. Stupid hobgoblin tribe around here always likes pretty jewelry even if it fakesy.” He says and takes the other one from your hand. <EOS>
<BOS> “You are a fool to listen to this demon and when she eats your soul, I am not going to be able to help you.” Heather interjects. <EOS>
<BOS> Yinen hands Warts a bag of coins, which Warts takes and then looks displeased about. <EOS>
<BOS> “Jake’s a lot of things, but he ain’t no rat. Chances are they won’t even take him in alive anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, you drag us all here sayin’ it’s important and then don’t even show up on time for yer own meeting.” Another remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sounds good to me.” <EOS>
<BOS> Vera’s right, if you’re going to do this, you need to exploit every resource you can. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, her mother will probably be coming for her soon.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, okay. So this is goodbye then…(sigh) I have to say it’s starting to get pretty lonely here what with all of the old gang gone.” <EOS>
<BOS> With a new goal in mind, a check on your rations, your flintlock pistol and a couple daggers along with your sword, you set off. <EOS>
<BOS> You watch the countryside pass by as the horses travel at a good pace. So far no trouble yet. You look behind you and see the supplies on the roof of the carriage and something you didn’t notice right behind you and the driver. A blunderbuss. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fucking rat.” He says before you die. <EOS>
<BOS> All Talon members were killed in the raid along with several Yellow Devil junkies, whores, and gamblers who were there betting on a bum fight. But as usual nobody really cares about some dregs of society getting massacred in the process because justice has been served! <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, that was certainly generous of them. Were they generous enough to keep my agents alive?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> One of the soldiers grabs you while another begins grabbing your belongings such as your weapons and your pack. They dump everything out and then after a few words to each other, one of them points in a different direction and they all leave. Whatever it is they were looking for you didn’t have, though you get the very real impression that it was a good idea to leave that crown behind after all. <EOS>
<BOS> "I told you, personal differences. I don't doubt that this ogre...or ogrfling isn't capable of doing the job. Mr. Reynolds prides himself too much on his word." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “A bit of an enigma. So much so, it would actually make Fel proud. All we know is they call themselves The Inquisitor.” <EOS>
<BOS> You fight with your sword as best you can, but eventually you are cut down. <EOS>
<BOS> "For your sake, I hope so. Because I'm not here to hold someone's hand and build up their confidence. That's going to be YOUR job. So you better be giving him pep talks, motivational hugs, or inspirational blow jobs. Whatever it is YOU gotta do, you better be doing it, because I'm going to be keeping a close eye on progress of this project." <EOS>
<BOS> Well hopefully more than one, but business has been okay lately. Could always be better, but you can't complain. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmm, must be pretty serious if you’re looking for an ogre to take care of this work and not doing it yourself. What’s this all about exactly?” <EOS>
<BOS> She was found at the foot of the tutors, the ones called for her older brother.  She asked them of many things. She was found in the court of her father, attending to the needs of the ministers. She listened as the concerns of the people were read. She was found in the kitchens and guest chambers, asking what could be improved. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, not at all. In fact I was going to tell you I won’t be needing them after all, seems I overreacted with the Syndicate visit.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> You begin your tale… <EOS>
<BOS> “Do you even know what you’re doing?” Annah asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Bullshit.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Dad? Why don’t people call you Count like they call mom Countess?” Kol asks. <EOS>
<BOS> While you had better things to do today, you probably should talk to both of them and do it now just to get it out of the way. <EOS>
<BOS> While this might have originally only resulted in you most likely getting your ass kicked, followed by the law taking you in, however you experience something a little different. <EOS>
<BOS> “I…well I just didn’t know we were getting into that tonight, I mean I figured you might need a little time. Plus, I figured we were going to discuss the plan to take down the Ebony Claw Syndicate which is not going to be an easy task. <EOS>
<BOS> And, in the evening, she was found with the servants in the garden, eating simple honeycomb as her reward. <EOS>
<BOS> "She's a bit eclectic," another says, "one month she might like spider jewelry, another tall wigs, another buttons. Fashion has never changed so fast." <EOS>
<BOS> You wave a hand down in the direction of your people from your prone position. <EOS>
<BOS> “You too bro. Hey don't squeeze too tight, I got my mandolin on my back and it’s pretty unique." Your sister remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> If Rook is already extending his hand, you might as well take it at this point. You’re at least on better terms with him than you are with Garrick. <EOS>
<BOS> The one who was accused slowly steps forward. <EOS>
<BOS> After seeing Vera off, you go to the Temple of Dorna, which of course has now been transformed, into a school. Still looks practically the same and there still aren’t many people in the place. Seems that not many have taken advantage of the chance to learn magic, or more likely, nobody in this scum-ridden city has the talent for it. (Or the money) <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I’m fine.” Zalmora replies. <EOS>
<BOS> "Not that I know of boss." Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “You know that’s not exactly true.” <EOS>
<BOS> Zamed squints a little and then speaks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Good. Now, we have a problem - namely you, and snooping, and that I can't just let you get off the boat without some assurances. But you've also shown yourself capable of basic trauma care. We could use that - our last doctor met an unfortunate end when he got too uppity. But you seem like a humble guy. You wouldn't do something so stupid as to threaten me, right?" Brost taps a map on his desk with his dagger. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, well I guess we better get started on getting all this up and running. I guess I should ask though, what is it with you and the slave trade anyway? Not that I would ever profess to be a Jochim saint, but I can’t say I’m going to necessarily enjoy this.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well nobody asked you Randi, look just leave me alone, you aren’t selling anything I’m interested in.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re still a little surprised that she hasn’t popped up again on your doorstep. You thought maybe she would have by now. The fact that she hasn’t does give you a little concern that maybe the Bloody Talons got a hold of her (or some similar fate) but if something bad has befallen her, there’s not much you can do about it and it’s certainly not your fault. <EOS>
<BOS> “This organization could do worse.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “So tell me Layla, what is your plan?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Enough talk, kid,” Seth intervenes. <EOS>
<BOS> "Pardon?" <EOS>
<BOS> Seth, still silent, pulls two wooden swords from the wall. You expect him to toss one to you, but instead, he charges forward weaving the swords into an attack pattern. You dodge a swipe near your head, and block closely followed second with your bracer. Immediately, you push Seth back with a kick in order to gain some distance. <EOS>
<BOS> With your ongoing information, Tanya has carried out one woman attacks on various ECS locations and been more or less successful in the endeavor. Though perhaps not entirely “one woman” she’s been using the chaos and the various factions of the city to her advantage, mostly the remaining disorganized followers of Neroth that have still been skulking around, though she’s been luring even the Holgard Watch to do her bidding sometimes. <EOS>
<BOS> “The last of the Neroth cultists died weeks ago and are probably enduring unimaginable torture right now as their reward and as for sending anyone else, I’m a little tired of acting from behind the scenes, I want to enjoy a bit of hands on mayhem for a change.” <EOS>
<BOS> You run back to Vera and call out to her. <EOS>
<BOS> “No. For whatever reason the Ebony Claw Syndicate has not fucked with us. If we start going into their territory, that could change. Besides this this isn’t really expansion so much as relocation. I really think for my own mental health I need a change of location. Too many fucked up memories and baggage here.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I thought you said I wouldn’t be much help with my little dagger.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No.” you say, genuinely not hearing anything. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ll take that slight pause as a yes and you really need to work on your attempts at misdirection and lying. What sort of thief are you?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Just get it over with.” <EOS>
<BOS> She’s dressed in pragmatic clothing more suited to one skilled of the ways of a rogue. In some ways she looks a little like an older version of Annah. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wrong day for optimism, friend. No, gonna take you to the Syndicate. They’ll pay a nice price for you. Not sure what you did to piss them off, but they really got it in for you.” <EOS>
<BOS> Days pass and you still have no idea who is doing this. Soon Camid stops reporting in and you start losing Talons. With your loss of manpower, you aren't able to run much of anything. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, money is always an issue these days, but I think I’ve got a solution to your problem. Just hold on a moment while we get our drinks.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Nothing.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> Throughout the day, Spryce brings you a half-dozen patients. They don't speak - though you assume they can - save one who burbles in another foreign language. Tall, short, light, dark, bronze, stocky, thin, male, female - there doesn't seem to be anything that immediately links them, though they all are adults of working age. None of them bear the garb of the sailors. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera then slaps you again harder. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah an’ fortunately I noticed the signs since I nearly stepped in hobgoblin shit a couple times. Just glad this dumb humie couldn’t tell the difference between it and regular animal shit.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I have to go back.” Tanya says with a sniffle. <EOS>
<BOS> “Let’s have a look around. Grab anything that looks like it might have some value.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Normally someone like you would be disposed of, however many of my peers are short sighted and don’t always see opportunity clearly. The fact that you’ve managed to survive this long either means you’re incredibly lucky or you’re more intelligent than you appear. I’m hoping it’s the latter since if you are intelligent that means you have untapped potential.” Rook says. <EOS>
<BOS> You cut off the man before he can continue. “Past success doesn’t promise future victories. In each of those cases, it may have been my blade finishing the task, but every man here played their part. Keep your blade sharp…” <EOS>
<BOS> “What? Seriously? Weren’t aware you were interested in me.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> "My tavern? You've been there?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Well still. A boy like you should be careful. These bandits are terrible brutes. They don’t just rob people, they usually kill them too. Sometimes they do even worse things. Why I shudder to think what they’d do to a handsome lad like yourself. You’d find yourself stripped, beaten and violated several times over before they finally slit your throat…and then perhaps violated repeatedly again…I mean who could stop them if they caught you all alone?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Did you know about this?” he questions. <EOS>
<BOS> As for the job, it goes a lot better than the one you did with Warts that’s for sure. <EOS>
<BOS> "It sounds incredible!" <EOS>
<BOS> In the middle of the night you suddenly hear your cell door open and you groggily wake up. <EOS>
<BOS> “You can return to your ship. Your captain will be back shortly.” <EOS>
<BOS> While they’re arguing amongst themselves, this gives you the split second you need to drop Kol (Which since you’re crouching, isn’t far at all) and pull your own pistol. <EOS>
<BOS> When the noble returned, the cage sat empty. And though he called, the bird did not return. “He promised!” The noble seethed. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I actually heard from another source a couple years ago that I’m still not very well liked at the old homestead.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, Warts wasn’t lying, you do look half dead.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> The first time you saw it at this range you were partially enchanted. This time is no different, but you’re still aware enough that this isn’t normal behavior for her, especially in these circumstances. <EOS>
<BOS> "Sounds like logical precautions." <EOS>
<BOS> The one you hit in the chest lies bleeding, clutching his blood soaked shirt and still convulsing. He’s dying, but you’re not waiting that long and shoot him in the head. <EOS>
<BOS> As the whores grumble, one of the more unkept employees raises their hands. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, however you are a neutral party and if you’re willing, you might be able to talk with them. Of course there’s a bit of a danger though. The Dornans as you might know have taken a cocoon like approach to this whole event with their protective barrier around their own temple. Only Holgard Watchmen who patrol through the area at times are allowed anywhere near the place. The Joachimites attempted an attack on it once and they were incinerated almost instantly. Even they haven’t dared to do it again.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I keep thinking of what you said about the muses. Are they really behind the disappearance of stories? I have to know." <EOS>
<BOS> "Hah. No. I don’t have the best track record with barmaids. So what about mom and dad? I heard they were doing okay a couple years ago, I trust that’s still the case?" <EOS>
<BOS> “They won’t now, you’ve got our help. With our forces together the Joachimites will eventually crumble. I don’t care who this Inquisitor asshole is, he won’t be shit after all his buddies start dying.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re probably going to die anyway, but at least in your head you can take comfort in the fact that you tried. <EOS>
<BOS> “Do you really think you need to handle this directly? I mean we’ve got several people; surely it would be just a simple matter of having one of them sneakily pop them in the back of the head with a single shot. Or shit, we could just send a bunch of people to overwhelm them right now where they’re staying. I mean it just seems safer for all of us.” <EOS>
<BOS> “There’s no agenda, I’m just getting sick of this fucking city. I’m also sick of paying off the Syndicate. Since you consider this your territory anyway, you might as well have the headache of running it, because I’m done.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you get to Judge Randal, he sits behind his high desk and looks incredibly tired. You see him sentence various people before he finally gets to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fortunately for you that you weren’t where I just was, because there was a bunch of orcs that size on horseback about to destroy the Caravan I was part of.” <EOS>
<BOS> As you approach the Grove, you find the forest growing richer. The cricks and brooks babble excitedly; the flowers burst forth in fragrant, erumpent displays; the birds show off with ornamented tunes, as if composed especially for this moment and this place; and even the soil takes on a richer brown, growing spongy and easy on your tired feet. A deep, electric feeling pulls you forward, but you resist it, walking slowly, aiming to etch every sight and sound and smell into your memory. <EOS>
<BOS> In any case you’re looking forward to finally meeting up with Vera in another day or so. She’s finally had time from her busy schedule of being a crime boss to come to Holgard. You’re sort of interested in learning more about what’s going on in Jicol since your new position has gotten a bit slow in Holgard, you’ve started sending out agents to various other places to keep apprised of the events going on there. So far you’ve only sent one to Klyton and a few to Delantium. <EOS>
<BOS> You tell Marco to keep everyone extra alert while the Syndicate is visiting and then go see Vera who is down in the slave den as usual. Right now she’s speaking with one of her overseers. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh I would never bring such a large sum with me. It can be picked up when you dock your ship at Nightfall. Let’s see, four dead captains means you get an extra ten on top of the twenty you’re already getting Zamed. And you two get ten apiece…now which one of you two nearly sailed away from battle again?” <EOS>
<BOS> “And? You think that makes it okay for you to just enter? If you haven’t noticed there’s a lot of strife currently going on in the city and we aren’t just letting anyone come inside.” One of the Felians says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Call off your men, or this will not end well.” Toz says. <EOS>
<BOS> “I appreciate you being up front with me with this offer and perhaps under better circumstances, I’d be more than happy to have you as allies, but think about it. If I backstab the Felians so easily after being allied with them, would you ever truly trust me?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> The voice in the crown told you that you’d have to give up your roguish ways and start a new life, but that’s really not going to be possible even if you wanted to. Right now you can see that you’re going to have to steal to survive. Possibly even the basics like new clothes because you are really sticking out with what you’re currently wearing. <EOS>
<BOS> “Move on with my life and how you didn’t have a choice. Fuck you. You DID have a choice. You could have stayed! We could have supported each other!” <EOS>
<BOS> “No. YOU aren’t going to be doing anything. I’m going to see her alone, without anyone else’s input. The decision will be final and mine only. I know you like to think you’re the one who runs things around here Zal, but you aren’t and you don’t get a say this time. Deal with it.” <EOS>
<BOS> "You been in Klyton long bossman?" Zalmora asks sarcastically. "Even before the council had militia crawling all over the city, this place was always a bit wary of non-citizens buying up property. Especially out of the blue. Surely you've already formed a story for all this." <EOS>
<BOS> “It means your little girlfriend is the only one here that at least has any connections, and since I’m a gentleman I won’t elaborate any further since it’s none of my concern anyway. My point is you fuckers have no damn ambition. You lot probably haven’t even left this island have you?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh no, we're going to be sticking to more familiar northern waters for awhile. Those lovely creatures won't be a problem where we're going." <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, potentially fucking a sibling, I can see where that would put a damper on things. Wish a damper was put on me last night.” <EOS>
<BOS> You didn’t really expect him to pry, but you feel like he’s probably not even going to entertain the idea unless you tell him everything about the plan. So you tell him and he listens intently. Meanwhile Olaf is still snoozing and the other man is continuing to watch you. <EOS>
<BOS> "Okay, so we got one potential overseer for this project. You got any more engineer ex-lovers?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course while you were so busy watching the door, you completely didn’t notice the person coming up to your table and sits down across from you. <EOS>
<BOS> “What am I saying? You wouldn’t see me, if I killed you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah, now I didn’t say that. While I can’t loan you Olaf, I can allow you the services of my other employee Henry over there. Henry! Stop playing with your knife and get over here. Got work for you.” <EOS>
<BOS> When everyone leaves, many to other parts of the library, the librarians sit you down to talk. There are three of them - two pointed woman with crisply pressed dresses, and one portly man with fiery hair. They interrogate you, and you inform them how you filled in after Claudia left - trying to sound as casual and friendly as possible, like you innocently meant to do them a favor and the money wasn't even a concern. <EOS>
<BOS> "Five thousand?" You answer <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m starting to wonder too, given all the shit you put me through on a daily basis!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well hello my dear boy. When they told me there was a young boy out on this ghastly road by himself, I knew I had to provide help. However, their description of you doesn’t do you justice. You are certainly are very fit and firm looking.” He says staring you up and down. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually Heather gets to you both giving you both the stink eye. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes, the smell is much better in this place. More earthy, less shitty." <EOS>
<BOS> You wait until Amanda is seemingly not busy and then approach her as she’s taking a break. <EOS>
<BOS> “The tome is here?” he asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Two years ago I guess. Didn’t know for an entire year either since I hadn’t been back ta visit Snuffit in awhile. Boy wuz she pissed at me when I returned. Anyway, he’s sort of with me for awhile since Snuffit says I should be spendin’ time him. She’s probably right. It’s hard growin’ up with no father.” Warts says with a bit of an introspective look down. <EOS>
<BOS> Then you turn to a blank endpaper, running a finger over the sheet of remembrance paper and pulling out a pen from your pack with the other hand. Whatever you write here should stay, for a long time to come. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? It’s not a trick.” You exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “No. Well not directly. We DO want you to stick around though. You see, we have done a little research on you. We know you came here years ago, we also know you were part of the Thieves’ Guild here before that and were instrumental in its destruction which THEN led to you being part of the Syndicate chapter here. Before Rook apparently blundered and cocked everything up. During all that time though, up until you created this Nocturnal League, you at your core were a thief. A good one though from what I’ve heard.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, I knows ya didn’t wanna stick around, but some of dose bottles is my cut!” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> Well there’s another bit of information you can add to your mental notes. <EOS>
<BOS> You tilt your head. <EOS>
<BOS> Which would mean a more traditional approach, but again, he’s got security up the ass and has his own personal retinue of guards around his home. Perks of fucking minor nobility you suppose. <EOS>
<BOS> You begin to explain in the shortest detail possible about your relationship with Tanya and the after effects. While you’re doing that, Teklis occasionally holds up some strange objects at you, some of which glow. He also says a few words and does a lot of hand motions in front of you, occasionally telling you to just continue your story and not to worry about what he’s doing. <EOS>
<BOS> You punch at Jake, but due to Vaughn being in the way, your fist doesn’t quite connect and you just tap Jake in the face a bit to knock his head back briefly. <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re trying to put the thoughts of your ex out of your mind, you start wondering about the possibility of leaving Klyton yourself after you acquire a little more. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s bullshit, there’s always a choice.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t worry about that. You get your rest, I’ll just be right here beside you.” <EOS>
<BOS> Even with wax in your ears you can still hear the nearby gunshot of an enchanted crew member shooting one of his fellows. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good thing you’re short and constantly walk around slightly hunched over most of the time. Oddly, this makes me feel slightly better. If there weren’t any traps at all I’d be even more paranoid about how easy this was. So far it seems like this guy just has shitty security, but then we haven’t actually gone inside yet.” You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, no. I’ll go there by myself. Um, what if this all turns out to be true?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> "You would really fucking do this to me wouldn't you? You probably planned this! Fucking bitch..." You mutter trying hard not to do something violent towards Zal. <EOS>
<BOS> You really dislike Ember and don’t care much for his pet Zorch Rat either. It has the ability to send out a shocking jolt of electricity on command and you have been hit by it enough over the years that you have developed a slight grudge (even though Ember is really to blame and not perhaps the little creature itself). <EOS>
<BOS> “My place? That’s a little far. Can’t we just go to yours? Your roommate is in class right now.” <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile, you hear giggling and footsteps of what sounds like two people rather than just one, and the lower sounding voice of the second voice sounds male. <EOS>
<BOS> The Monument of the Muses, a large fountain with an impressive statue of the muses,  looms over the northeast corner. You once donated a large sum of money to have it commissioned in her memory, and inscribed the plaque yourself. At the time, it seemed a fitting legacy for Ivani - back then, there was no need for the money the two of you had saved if there was no longer going to be a life together and children to come. Now, you wish you had kept a bit more back for yourself. Perhaps you could have taken this pilgrimage long ago, and ended your days in a home nearer to the Grove of Muses. But that would have meant leaving the home and grove she had made in the forest - and being with her memory was more precious than being near what was left of her body. <EOS>
<BOS> Things could always be better of course, but all things considered the Nocturnal League is doing well under your leadership. You actually managed to surprise yourself. Reminds you of when your father once told you that you could do very well anything if you just applied yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> “That happened ONE time.” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> As you lean against the ship's railing look out at the setting sun, you try to keep your own sanity by thinking of happier times with your sister or Zalmora. You hope either of them are doing a hell of a lot better than you are right now because this is without a doubt the WORST idea you ever had. <EOS>
<BOS> After an uneventful walk in the sewers, you get to the location. So far it doesn’t look much different than your future headquarters, though the rooms are bigger. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shut up criminal, or we’ll have you WALK the rest of the way tie to back of the cart!” one of the guards remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> The sheriff goes on to say that she isn’t the only one either. Apparently your father has hired the best freelance advocate he could find in Klyton. While it’s a pretty grim conclusion that you’re going to be found guilty, your father made so much of a stink that he demanded that you at least get a trial of sorts. <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad to hear it, but I don’t think I’ve got an organization anymore. Most of them are dead, and the rest that are still alive I don’t even want to be bothered to manage anymore.” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s a long way to Sivak though, and you’re probably going to have to more or less stick to the roads since you only have the vague knowledge that it’s east somewhere. <EOS>
<BOS> "Thanks hypocrite." You answer and start to leave. <EOS>
<BOS> You all search the immediate nearby rooms and areas, but don’t find much save for a lot more cobwebs. You enter one room, you find a couple of old vases that look like they might hold value. As you’re looking at those, one of your people ends up finding a stairway leading down. <EOS>
<BOS> You tell Peter that a criminal element will always exist in some way in a city as large as Holgard. Better that he deal with a friendly crime lord who can maintain order over it rather than wasting time attempting to stomp it all out. You also remind him that without you around, the Syndicate will definitely attempt to re-establish a presence back in the city and they engage in activities much worse like slave trading than your organization does. <EOS>
<BOS> Since you don’t want to go too far from Warts while he’s alone with a bunch of wine, you stay in the cellar and pick the lock of the metal door, which is surprisingly easy. <EOS>
<BOS> “Damn straight we did and those that we didn’t sailed away like scared guppies!” Elias laughs. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, you don’t give up. You don’t actually speak in your own trial, your advocate speaks for you and does a WAY better job than you ever could. Annah and your parents both testify on your behalf, and even a few people begrudgingly admit that they saw the entire fight with Klint and say you didn’t really mean to kill him. You really wish your sister was around because you imagine that she would be able to charm a few more folks to your side. <EOS>
<BOS> Turning the conversation back on track you say, “So where does that leave us? King Aeric banished me until I return with news of your raid. We must return at once.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Be very careful with your next words to me.” Annah warns. <EOS>
<BOS> “A whore that doesn’t know what the hell she’s doing with her life, but she’s still my cousin and she should finally get a little justice. So while normally I would love to see two enemies kill each other and making things a lot easier for us, it would be best if the followers of Neroth were curtailed. This city already has more than enough gods competing, and as a dedicated disciple to Fel, I see no reason why I shouldn’t aid directly in their fall. Consider the Holgard Watch taken care of by tomorrow.” <EOS>
<BOS> Mr. Reynolds points over to the ogre looking creature. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thought you said you were helping me out?” <EOS>
<BOS> You hear her just fine, you’re just trying to gather what strength you have and keep your focus on that laughing asshole Jake who is continuing to walk away from you. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s a lot of men in the open,” you comment. <EOS>
<BOS> “NO! NO! I WON’T GO WITH YOU! GET AWAY! PLEASE! JOACHIM SAVE ME!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why not? We’ve worked together before and obviously I trust you enough to reveal my temple’s status to you.” <EOS>
<BOS> With your last assailant dead, you grab your dagger out of his leg and get the hell out of the area since you’ve become more aware of your surroundings which are people screaming, yelling and generally running away. While this place might be a crime cesspit, the fact that you openly killed three Ebony Claw members in front of everyone (Which is something at least one of them was trying to avoid doing to you) you probably look crazier than the usual type of criminal around here, especially since you aren’t even in the worst part of the city. <EOS>
<BOS> During his time as an innkeeper however, he had become very close to a young barmaid by the name of Eliza. While their love didn’t blossom immediately, he soon realized his feelings before it was too late and the two became romantically involved and in time they married. <EOS>
<BOS> “The scroll. Read it,” Lorthander rasps. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, what is it? Am I going to start feeling a greater sense of loss as time goes on? Am I going to die of a broken heart in a few years or something?” <EOS>
<BOS> You’ll soon have this city’s entire underworld under the Nocturnal League’s control at this pace. <EOS>
<BOS> Wendy starts to smile, followed by a laugh. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh I don’t know. I’m not very good and I only know a few songs that my mother taught me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that’s wise anyway. Though Percy never even told me this plan. I only learned about it the moment it was revealed in this room. I do not even believe the Order gave this command as Percy claimed he heard it directly from Fel himself. Though your words indicated that Fel spoke to your son as well. I cannot know why a god would give one a command, but only to sabotage it. Seems contradictory, but I’ve never pretended to be the most fanatical follower. I worship purely for the extra power that the god gives me for whatever reason and use that power to support the Syndicate.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Who’s Yrid?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose to many I am. I have even questioned my own sanity at times, but then I remember, Joachim has given me his guidance and holy mission. And no matter what, I will not fail in that mission. I have learned from my failures and will follow a new path to bring his divine justice.” <EOS>
<BOS> "How can this be?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Good luck with that one.” You say barely able to contain a smile. <EOS>
<BOS> “Quite a nice village you have here,” you comment. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, but I think I should probably have Zal with me.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Isn't that very rare?" you ask, putting your things on the lower bunk. <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sigh) Yeah, I know…guess I’m just starting to wonder why I ever thought this was fun. I’ll leave you to your drugs and whores.” <EOS>
<BOS> Well that peaked your interest. <EOS>
<BOS> Scully was either wrong about mermaids not being in northern waters or you're more off course than you thought. Either way it doesn't matter because you're being assaulted by them and you're shoving wax in your ears. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m serious, don’t do that again.” <EOS>
<BOS> Halfway through the weary mountain trek, you are already regretting the decision. But your guide, Pelomin, encourages you with trivia about the Cathedral, even a few things you did not know about Coruscal and the blood gods. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t know what kind of greeting you’re going to get, but you’re going to have to be on your guard, but then you always are. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well I'm thinking the gambling games and the fighting arena will be eventually, but the Yellow Devil lab can stay out in those sewer storage rooms along with the junkies. I'm not having melted junkies mess up the floor when we finally get around to putting proper ones down. Mostly though, it's going to be where we can rest and relax without the smell. See how all the potential sleeping areas were built very far away from the sewer wall that was knocked down for the entrance." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> To her credit, she’s told you to stay behind on this one, claiming that she can take care of it herself. You have your doubts though. It would be a tough fight even for her. You’d hate to just stand by while she got herself killed, not to mention if she failed, it would be really obvious that you were involved considering you told Rook you killed her. So you’d have to help anyway, and you still don’t fancy your chances. <EOS>
<BOS> Don’t bother going to Hessla to try to track me down, I didn’t go there. <EOS>
<BOS> Along with giving you the location of where Jake is supposed to be currently camped out, Tom gives you the directions to Mr. Reynolds place, though you’ve passed it a few times before during your stretch here in Klyton so you know where it is. From what you’ve heard, Mr. Reynolds hasn’t changed his location in decades and he wasn’t young when your grandfather (And later father) owed him money. While you’ve also heard he looks human, there are rumors that he isn’t or he’s at least cheating the aging process somehow. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Yinen’s voice sounds more fanatical even if it remains calm and you get a very uneasy feeling. So uneasy in fact that you go for your weapon. <EOS>
<BOS> “But?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Definitely not." You say as you both exchange pleasant goodbyes. <EOS>
<BOS> While the dip and sway of the camel takes some getting used to, overall the trip is almost comfortable. Each day, the group rises early to travel in the cool of the morning, and only suffers through a few sweltering hours before breaking for a sumptuous lunch. Tents are erected by the servants and pillows brought out, and everyone - including the servants - is welcome to partake of the water, sandwiches, and citrus fruits. Afterwards, you can choose whether to nap in the shade or pass the time with games or conversation. About three, it's all packed up, and the group is moving again within a half-hour. This is the hardest part of the day, for the sun is high and the Crimson Sands radiate heat. But the hours of midday rest and refreshment make it bearable, and the camel will keep moving even if you accidentally doze for a while. Sometimes, a servant will come by and offer to fan you, but you wave them on. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t think the thought hasn’t crossed my mind. You know why I’m even still in the Talons? Because deep down I’m actually hoping you know what you’re doing. So far you’re ahead, but I’m just wondering for how long. Edmond was pretty much running things like you are now. Granted you are less of a violent asshole than he was, but I’m seeing the same pattern.” <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t exactly feel good about this, but then you don’t see as you have much choice. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, yeah, I’ll take a trip to the tailor’s or something.” <EOS>
<BOS> You and Zal walk to your newly acquired inn. You've seen it from the outside several times which is in fairly good shape despite it being abandoned for years. When you get inside, you find that it isn't in too bad of condition inside either though very dusty obviously. <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, I guess I can sort of see that logic. I’m not really religious, but occasionally I have said the odd thanks to Yag.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shhhh! Keep your voice down!” <EOS>
<BOS> Marco nods and you begin overseeing the final death knell of Jicol’s government…at least as it currently exists. <EOS>
<BOS> “Move on from me. Goodbye my love.” She says and leaves. <EOS>
<BOS> “Makes sense. Though I suppose a few wild ones would have been interesting to research as well, but tame ones will probably be easier for intelligence testing. I really didn’t expect so many. You want one as a pet or something?” <EOS>
<BOS> “It is a school, but I’m not sure what you were expecting. Magic isn’t exactly a common force in the world that it used to be so you’re not going to find with place overflowing with people. If it were, things would be severely different in this city. Not to mention the government isn’t exactly the most keen on supporting it. If it wasn’t for one of our own on the Klyton Council, I dare say this place would have been shutdown entirely.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes. My concern is if you’re as intelligent as Camid claims you are, one wonders why the hell you’re hanging around a bunch of criminals. For kicks? Well I can see that I suppose, but Yellow Devil? Come on, surely a girl like you knows the dangers of doing that vile drug.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What’re you doing?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “OR if I hadn’t taken your advice, I might have been in this position a lot sooner. In fact despite you always bringing it up, I’d say not listening to you turned out to be a lot better ” you remark. <EOS>
<BOS> “This asshole is lying Rook!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well. Let’s get to it then shall we?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Another one? What’s that like six now? You keep that up and the entire Spiderfang Tribe is going to be related to you in some way.” <EOS>
<BOS> You go over to Vera who stands waiting. <EOS>
<BOS> While talking about Tanya is nice, you also remind yourself of the loss you feel without her around. You explain that it’s not as bad as it was when you first parted ways, but every now and then you have that empty feeling. You also mention “the curse” which peaks Flynn’s interest even more. He asks you several questions on that, which you answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fair enough.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, it’s important that you know your place as a woman. Speaking of kids, where’s Kol?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I mean I’d sooner join up with Elias who runs the slave market. The only reason why I haven’t is because he’s a fucking asshole.” Another remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “He taking one of us?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “So are you the leader of the Thieves Guild?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah! I knew it. You look a lot like your father. He was in my microbiology class when I used to teach it. Did very well too. How he doing?” the woman asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Again, if you’re going to move to make war on the ECS, you’re going to be absolutely sure. Also you’ve now just upset your son and while this is very serious, you might need to employ less aggressive tactics. <EOS>
<BOS> You go through a couple more old collapsed sewer tunnels and then you notice the man made structure is starting to disappear into a crumbling abyss. You also notice how weak the ground (or rather what’s left of it) is in general. One wrong move and you’re probably falling to your death. You cautiously move across what’s left the stone flooring. <EOS>
<BOS> You explain the situation in greater detail and Annah says that she (or Jenny at least) can probably find what you’re looking for. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re going to have to at least make the attempt, as much as you’d rather just run. <EOS>
<BOS> “Annah, I know how to pick a fucking lock, will you stop bitching? This is for your benefit. Are you even paying attention?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> "Long story." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I certainly would have. To be fair though this probably wouldn’t have been possible if not for that flooding disaster. Never did quite recover from that.” You say and then look at the destruction around you. “Wonder if this place will recover from this, going to take a lot to rebuild this place. I guess we’ll see.” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> When morning arrives, you’re still awake and you check on Kol, and find that Vera has fallen asleep in a chair next to Kol, who is still sleeping. Your arrival wakes her up though. <EOS>
<BOS> “Can you move around? Can you feel anything?” Tanya asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Much like her daughter, Wendy's wrinkled face frowns at you in silence. She doesn't like this, but her silence is a good sign. It means despite her belief in Joachim she's still pragmatic enough to consider your offer. <EOS>
<BOS> Looking around, you see racks of weapons and armor lining the walls. While a large table in the center of the room contains an assortment of potions and other items. <EOS>
<BOS> “I know! She does silly things like try to play that flute thing instead of focusing on more important matters!” <EOS>
<BOS> Soon it’s just you and Garrick and he wastes no time in speaking. <EOS>
<BOS> The carriage you’re currently on goes faster, but it’s obvious that the orc raiders are going to attempt to cut everyone off assuming they don’t kill everyone with arrows first. <EOS>
<BOS> “If you passed through here around that time, it was during my less respectable pre-hero days.” You laugh. <EOS>
<BOS> And then another volley of cannons fires off and completely obliterates everything in front of you. <EOS>
<BOS> “I have to say I was a little surprised that the Dornan high priestess came to me though. I figured with all their magic they would be more than able to take care of themselves.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You nod and thank Flynt while pocketing the coins and grabbing the package. <EOS>
<BOS> By the time you arrive in Klyton, it’s midday again. The couple gets off and you pay for a ride to the university. You’re just hoping Dr. Gossey is the sort of woman you think she is and will accept the qweepas along with your tale of what happened to her assistant. <EOS>
<BOS> You and your sister head to a more comfortable room where you both can relax while addressing each other’s questions. <EOS>
<BOS> “You okay dad?” Kol asks coming up to you. <EOS>
<BOS> There are low murmurs of assent. You see faces with furrowed brows and shaded eyes, a mixture of sorrowful and resolute. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wha…SERIOUSLY? You are fucked up! NO, DON’T!” Gertrude shouts and prevents one of the other traitors from firing at you, or rather pushes his arm so the shot goes wild. <EOS>
<BOS> Seeing as you aren’t really doing anything better right now and in no condition to resist. You go with the soldiers and follow to a slightly better looking building than the rest of the village. <EOS>
<BOS> “The problem is, I’ll fucking kill you! My dick is fucking cursed!” <EOS>
<BOS> "Perhaps," one soldier suggested, "it will lure them out?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Us! I mean that’s what I’ve been saying this whole time! If we join forces, nobody can stop us! Taking out Elias and taking his wealth and his place is just the first step in getting this new organization up and running. So? Who’s with me?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Farewell, doctor pilgrim!" he laughs. <EOS>
<BOS> Ivani and you ride horses through the forest, laughing, but your horse turns into a talking bear. "Woe!" he says, "Four woes on Sandrella! The first two have come, one is now, and one is yet to come!" <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh I've been doing this job for so long and I think it's time to move on to bigger things. Just time for a change. Maybe you even inspired me a bit. How about that eh? Anyway, my son will be taking over this old business. He's more than qualified. Don't worry, if you ever need a loan for your inn, I've already told him that he can't refuse to do proper business with someone just because he doesn't like them. If that was the case, I wouldn't have done business with anyone at all!" <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Your clothing as usual is also pretty unique. A bit too colorful for my tastes, but then again you always were the flashy one.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck this. Your mind is obviously made up about me, so if you’re going to try to kill me, you better just try to do it now, otherwise I’m going to just leave.” <EOS>
<BOS> “How is it any different than making some dumb ass addicted to Purple Wish? They basically become a slave to the drug.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Was he armed or something?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t see why it’s really all that surprising. Heather helped us in the past and she’s running things now. The Dornans aren’t even very religious anymore; they turned their temple into a school of sorts. Don’t think they’ve got many takers yet though.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> "Too damn long bro. Too damn long. Hey don't squeeze too tight, I got my mandolin on my back and it’s pretty unique." Your sister says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I wuz thinkin’ I could help ya on a job or sumthin.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well they’ve been sort of busy with other things, like their recent war with Nichan for example. While the ruling class over there doesn’t want to spend their resources and treasury to take this place back, they certainly won’t turn down someone else willing to do the job, and that’s where Peter comes in. He’s of noble birth, loyal to the kingdom and would be an excellent governor for this city and absorb it back into Delantium’s fold.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Leave here and come to Jicol.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> This is just a nightmare. You’re almost thinking maybe you should have just risked getting lynched back in Teckleville. At least there you would’ve had your parents to help you and maybe even Annah, assuming she lived. At worst, you would have at least died at home. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m fine Garrick, stop fussing.” <EOS>
<BOS> Your vision begins to darken as your hands try to feel the back of your head, which of course has Ardan’s axe in it. <EOS>
<BOS> “I need something to help call the demon back to this realm just to give the spell a little more power. Usually for most demons this requires a sacrifice of some sort, however given that Tanya is a succubus, I don’t think blood will be necessary, so fortunately I just need you to have sex with him inside the circle.” <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya then begins kicking you and you curl up while shouting for mercy and asking what the hell is going on. <EOS>
<BOS> Your next move is to try to find a horse, which as far as you know the few that are in town are near the magistrate building. You run back towards that way, meanwhile Ardan has recovered from his wound and begins shouting. <EOS>
<BOS> "As you say." Zal says almost implying that you don't know what you're doing. <EOS>
<BOS> “Blackheart Inn…why the hell don’t these inns ever have invitin’ names? Like I dunno, the friendly titties, or sumthin.” <EOS>
<BOS> The dead women however are still with you. The images of you being there now feel more like a faint memory. You get the terrible feeling you DID kill them. You aren’t sure if it’s due to a curse or some mental break down you had after the break up with Tanya, but they aren’t going away. You’re going to just have to try to rebury those thoughts again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, since you said you’re not allowed in, just wait outside and I’ll be out soon.” Annah says as you get to Sparkling Treasures. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I thought so to, I mean I’ve had sex tons of other times with other guys before you and then we’ve had it a lot when we got together and nothing. I can’t imagine what changed.” <EOS>
<BOS> Captain Elias and grovels gratitude before leaving. You snort a bit of laughter before walking over to the mayor and the woman who have been watching the entire time. <EOS>
<BOS> Now you’re getting irritated. <EOS>
<BOS> “There’s nothing here for me in this town.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah a wedding.” <EOS>
<BOS> The group of red robed folks don’t say much to their more passionate comrade, but a couple give some quieter acknowledgements of agreement. Meanwhile you’re still hiding in the darkness wondering if you’ll get lucky and get a kill with every bullet before they take you down. Fortunately they move on past you without seeing you. <EOS>
<BOS> “The plans to move our activities to mainly outside Klyton, yes. The rest of it, I’d keep a lid on until later. It will be better to not overwhelm him with suggestions. So, you ready for another round stud, or do we have to waste more time talking?” <EOS>
<BOS> Your eyes draw back to the map and the wooden figurines representing both your army and the Empire’s. You symbolically knock the Empire’s to the ground. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the fuck are you staring at me for?” Ardan asks. <EOS>
<BOS> When you’re naked you step into the circle with Vera who immediately begins to embrace you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, funny how that bit of information woke you up immediately. Seriously, get up I need you for a wedding.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Get your people out of this city and back to that fucking broken down temple in the jungle you call home. I never want to see you or your kind in this city again. If I do, you’ll be executed on sight. The Nocturnal League and whatever other gang of criminal cutthroats that tries to form in Jicol are through here. Understand?” the captain warns. <EOS>
<BOS> “Then what? Random chance?” you input. <EOS>
<BOS> You eventually manage to stand up, but you feel like you’re going to teeter over again. Tanya is still fighting the EC leader, but she’s not making much progress. In fact, he might even have a slight advantage since he hasn’t been exerting himself as much as she has tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> You then check your supplies, which aren’t much. You’ve got a few coins, but you aren’t excessively worried about that since food and water are more important out here in the wilderness. You’ve got a little food and water, but it isn’t going to last long. The only weapon you have currently is your dagger. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tell me what I seek!” Samuel shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> Upon thinking about it you decide you’ll just have to take Heather by surprise when you accompany Gloom on his invasion of the temple. She’ll be expecting you to be on her side, so you should have the drop on her and her people. You’ll need to make those shots count and attempt to take cover immediately. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes! Yes exactly!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Boss, there’s a lady out here that wants to see you. Even called for you by name. She says she come about the bard position, but as far as I know we didn’t have one of those.” Marco says. <EOS>
<BOS> As you feel the claws dig into your flesh and Scales give you the predatory stare, all you can think about is how Zal is dead, but you also realize if you’re going to get out of this alive, you’re going to have to continue to talk because it’s very obvious that you’re not fighting your way out of this or running. <EOS>
<BOS> “W…what?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Something funny?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “But what?” <EOS>
<BOS> You and your “hit squad” head over to the new headquarters dig site. You remember Madeline was doing her overseeing there today. <EOS>
<BOS> Only having escape in your mind, you attempt to rush out of the carriage, unfortunately you’re not quite quick enough opening up the door and Graham fires his pistol at you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Probably not, I wouldn’t know what else I could use my skills for anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Works for me. So any information of what’s going on with this new coalition of independent rogues? Like maybe who the leader is? <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe it was Tom from the Crimson Talons? You can’t imagine what he’d want to see you directly for though. You’d imagine if he were trying to recruit you again he’d send an underling to invite you to see him. Tom wasn’t a huge guy either; of course given that Virgil is on the short and scrawny side, he probably thinks you’re a big guy too. <EOS>
<BOS> In time though, it turned out Ludmilla was far more competent and more pragmatic than her father and started actually focusing on making the city safer and less of pit of crime and disorder that it’s become known for. Which in turn is making your profession a bit harder. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, okay, I had to ask. I still don’t know how you originally pulled off this whole college student thing, which you still won’t tell me.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Silence, demon,” Seth says tackling you to the floor. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah begins taking off her clothes and getting on the bed. <EOS>
<BOS> You eventually find the shop you’re looking for “Elegant Elixirs.” You tell your people to wait outside and you open the door and you’re immediately assaulted by the strong smell of herbs and who knows what else. It actually causes you to cough a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey boss. Found something.” <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t help but wonder if the Ebony Claw Syndicate was still around if the Temple of Fel would be doing much better than they are. It might be a case that you’re going to have to be the ones to help instead. <EOS>
<BOS> Yinen briefly looks at you and while he knows who you are, he returns to his rocking and mumbling. You can’t even tell what he’s saying, but he sounds like he saying something religious. You hear Joachim’s name being mentioned a few times. <EOS>
<BOS> "Like there is something wrong with memory," you offer. <EOS>
<BOS> It occurs to you how strange it is to be at the university at all. You never thought you’d ever “attend” your dad’s old place of higher learning. You’re sure at one time he had hopes you would, but it probably wasn’t under these circumstances. <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, I guess the safety in numbers thing. So when do I get to go to the big hideout?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey. I guess you figured out what happened.” Madeline says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Where the hell is that?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Truly? And how did this come about?” Rook asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Despite the ongoing past criticism of Tom of how he’s a weak leader, he’s not really a weak man because he dominates the fight for the most part. He’s certainly a better fighter than you. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh you're not going soft, you're just playing the odds and the odds are in favor of a better life if you get out of this game now." Zal says in an attempt to reassure you. <EOS>
<BOS> Your orders are carried out and life continues as usual for you. Weeks pass and for a while you think you’re probably not going to get an answer. In fact you start to wonder if the Joachimites already succeeded in wiping them all out. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well considering how many I have shot, I’d say it’s not a bad plan. Not to mention it’s something I could have easily done on my own.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m Claire, and it’s not far sir, we can take a carriage to there quicker. It’s also fairly close to the university so when you’re rested I can take you over there.” <EOS>
<BOS> “ARGH SHIT FUCK! MY LEG!” he yells. <EOS>
<BOS> "Hey, that's your right. It's not a qualification for the job. More for someone else as they say." <EOS>
<BOS> "I expect it's worth around 450 silver," you say, bluffing confidence. <EOS>
<BOS> Slowly, a flicker of wonder ripples through you, even excitement. <EOS>
<BOS> “You didn’t kill all of them. You missed one, but I sort of get the weird impression that you wouldn’t have anyway. It’s odd. You had some real harmony with that one and it was just a one-night stand. I dare say you didn’t even get to that level with that Vera girl and you knew her quite well.” <EOS>
<BOS> "It's fine, it's fine. You done?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Calmly, you address him. “That’s what separates us from them. There’s no honor in execution, in defeating an unarmed prisoner. The day is won. We mustn’t stain the glory of our victory with massacre.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Buried treasure!" <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey what’s…AH!” Annah yelps as Klint’s knife goes straight into her stomach. <EOS>
<BOS> You have some mixed feelings about all this, but really this is probably the best way to handle all this. <EOS>
<BOS> "So...wait. Are we defenders of the down trodden now?" Zal asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Several of said arrows go into your carriage and you try to get as flat as possible. You really wish you still had your pistol. You’d at least be able to fire back. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah hits you again <EOS>
<BOS> You stand up and step back while Marco’s people slowly go see to him. <EOS>
<BOS> The man, Horne, bows his head slightly and disappears back in to the forest. Even with your years of training, you barely hear his footsteps. Horne’s ability to melt into his surroundings are almost supernatural, a ghost silently watching from the outside. <EOS>
<BOS> “Never noticed, but no, I just got something important business to talk to Tom about.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm. We all got our struggles. Well, I guess we better get going, time and money and all. You did have a good time though right?” <EOS>
<BOS> She also mentions that she recently visited your parents and besides being glad to see her, they also told her what happened with you a few months after she left. What's fascinating to you though is apparently you were cleared of murder months after you left! <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe the wizard Kragan Firehand can help, if you can get to his tower on Dagger Hill. But he’s notoriously stingy. He’ll help alright, but if you can’t pay coin for his services, you’ll owe him something. Maybe you should try to get to the remains of your home and dig up the family coffer from under the floorboards before you go… <EOS>
<BOS> “Well we could also head to Holgard or the Delantium Kingdom, I think the closest city there is Sivak” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> You get dressed and gather your tools of the trade and exit your room ready to get to work. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hold on, we’ll have to ask the boss first.” One says and then they both gallop back to the carriage. You don’t wait long before they return. <EOS>
<BOS> You manage to get back up and then another gunshot rings out. This one unfortunately hitting you in the back. You fall back down to the ground and don’t get up again. <EOS>
<BOS> One by one, the monks step out over the cliff into the portal. The way their bodies disappear reminds you of dropping a rock into a pond. Seth walks to the portal with his hands on his hips shaking his head. You could imagine his thought: “today of all days...” <EOS>
<BOS> “First off, Garrick is NOT my fucking boss. I don’t have a boss. Second, if you were any worse, I’d seriously be questioning Garrick’s decision on this. Arguably the ONLY thing in your favor as far as I’m concerned is the fact you killed three ECS members. And you did that sloppy as well and it isn’t making me inclined to impress me any more than when I first had the displeasure of laying eyes on you.” <EOS>
<BOS> Heather looks at you as if you weren’t supposed to know her dealings with the Baroness. <EOS>
<BOS> “Anyway, I have your payment. It’s right outside loaded on that carriage you probably passed on your way in here.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Call it my own twisted sense of honor, but at least our extortion of businesses isn’t completely one sided. I mean we ARE offering protection. Also we’re not shoving Purple Wish down anyone’s throat. If people want to get high, we’re providing a product. If people want to be idiots and get addicted well that’s on them. Our gambling places work the same way. Nobody is forcing anyone to go into debt.” <EOS>
<BOS> You head over towards the children's section where many kids are sitting on the floor as a woman regales them with a story. It's a simple, but charming one, about a dog who finds an old shoe, and instead of chewing on it like one would expect, he wears it as a hat. The children laugh a bit, but the parents look slightly bored. A couple kids tip her a coin as they leave, and she waits a few minutes for the group to fill up again. The woman looks a bit tired. You have no idea how long she has been speaking, but currently there are only about 14 silver coins in her straw hat. <EOS>
<BOS> If luck holds, you will reach the Grove by afternoon, and finally see Ivani. If she is there at all, beneath the stone husk that is left of her, you hope she will help you understand what is happening to memory, and all the other questions spinning through your mind. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmm, I see. To be honest those Neroth worshipping assholes DO need to be dealt with. While some in the Ebony Claw don’t consider them top priority, I see them as a potential problem in the future. Especially since we’ve started to have our own run ins with them. Though I may be a bit biased considering they did kidnap my cousin once. Oh, by the way, always meant to thank you for rescuing her.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Really? Aren't you concerned that I'll be manipulating you with my magical vagina?" Zal asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, I don’t got no money humie. The only thing I got in my pants is muh dick and I ain’t givin up dat.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Thanks!” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m guessing you don’t keep up on politics, m’boy, but then why would someone like you really need to, but yes the city is doomed. The Baron’s days are numbered. Honestly it must only be by Yag’s luck that he’s survived as long as he has.” <EOS>
<BOS> Fortunately you trip up Klint in the process, who instead of taking advantage, continues to stumble in the direction he was already running in. Unfortunately, Annah was just coming out of Jasmine’s shop at the time. <EOS>
<BOS> “About what exactly? Your son just happens to be the lucky few, that has natural magical talent. Just happens to be shadow oriented, though with a little training, he could probably become skilled in other types as well. I imagine some place like the magic university in Delantium would be a good place to send him if he really wants to take advantage of his abilities. Though I suppose the one in Klyton is okay if you want to save money.” <EOS>
<BOS> The wizard Kragan goes over to the table and picks up a leather scroll. <EOS>
<BOS> "From here, you could take a donkey northwest through the Ashen Veldt. It's pretty desolate out there in the plains, and ashy, but it's flat ground - even an untrained rider can make it. Plan to camp, as it's a two-day ride to Logvorn. From there, you can catch a boat. <EOS>
<BOS> “Just…t…ake Kol…conta…ct…Vera…in the…League…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Now I was already told the little story that you told everyone outside in order to get in here, but why don’t you go over it again with me directly so I can try to grasp it myself and attempt to understand your logic.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t ask, because I didn’t need your help!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Excellent workmanship. Not sure how you came across it, but rest assured it will be in better hands, much like Vera.” Zamed says. <EOS>
<BOS> And yet it wasn't that long ago at all. It's only been six years since you changed your life for the woman you love. <EOS>
<BOS> “YOU are NOT going to stop this son. Take solace in the fact that you NEVER had a choice.” Mr. Reynolds says in a low firm voice. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh? Interesting. Have I offended you directly in some way? Perhaps Toz here has? I know he’s a little on the impersonal side, but…” <EOS>
<BOS> “I gotta say Marco, I was skeptical when you first brought the idea to me and going by the story you’re telling me, I’d say I was completely right. Fortunately for you Yag smiles on fools and it worked out anyway.” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> “Actually that’s LESS for us since he won’t even be sending his cut anymore.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well, if this is the only way.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, looks like no more hiding in the trees.” Annah says. <EOS>
<BOS> You just hope you never get on her bad side. <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, you also remember Percy’s advice about doing something worse than killing her. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re starting to wonder that maybe you weren’t so much bored when you came up with the idea to form the Nocturnal League so much as you were trying to keep your mind occupied on other things. It actually has worked great in that regard, or it did until Vera was about to pursue promotion via cock sucking. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh yes, the cage that I rescued your ass from, because nobody here gave a shit! And your leadership is a good example of why nobody does, because you’re ultimately a weak leader who is content on coasting and leeching off others.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s one of the perks of being in charge of an island. You can dress anyway you want. Come, let me introduce you my wife!” <EOS>
<BOS> “There’s no debate m’boy. She’s going to go. I mean there probably will be an urge to resist at first, but it doesn’t take long before that infernal blood pulls them in and they return to fully embrace their demon powers “ <EOS>
<BOS> You attempt to bargain, but it's no use. The Headsmen have heard shit like this all before and the officer eventually smashes you head with the bottom of his two handed axe. Dazed and brought low by this hit, the officer manages to nearly make a clean cut. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because it’s all your fucking fault! I could have gotten with your sister if YOU hadn’t been around!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm. Didn’t consider that. Would that work?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Other loved ones, friends or family of note were looked into, but the only other major one we ever learned about was a demonkin girl by the name of Tanya.” Percy says as he takes his drink from the returning waitress. <EOS>
<BOS> The room is much more luxurious than the practice room in the monastery, though that is the case for nearly every room in the castle. It is a castle, after all. Various weapons line the room, neatly placed on racks. Cloth towels are folded in the corner to wipe down sweat and equipment after use. It definitely made for a less musty smell than the practice room in the monastery. Something about the place felt fabricated, almost too orderly. Your brief experience with combat already revealed the chaotic nature of war. Keeping the place where you train for battle clean feels a little wrong like untrained nobles in extravagant armor. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sheesh, Warts a family man with a regular job, you working for the government. So much has changed here and it all seems so odd.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s a long story…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t be so sure. Remember, all of these people are motivated by their love and faith of Joachim, not this Inquisitor. He’s just leading the charge. However, you may have a point in that if he was out of the picture quicker, then perhaps those of lesser conviction may indeed be shaken enough to no longer be a concern. While our attempts at breaking through the Inquisitor’s magic defenses have failed, I can think of one group who might be able to and that’s the Dornans.” <EOS>
<BOS> “While I’m impressed that you’re thinking a lot more about this shit than most people here, I’m of the mind that for now, we should play more on our current strengths. We can diversify again later.” Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Fine." He ducks out from under the bed above him into the middle of the small room, taking up most of the space and stretching. "It's not my problem." <EOS>
<BOS> "The late Olaf?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck yes I’m serious! As far as I know all couples have their issues, yours just happens to be more complicated. Okay first thing you need to do is go fuck some whores.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Indeed. So you're the infamous twin sister I've heard so much about. I guess you can stay for now." <EOS>
<BOS> “The Fel temple is rogue in many ways. I don’t propose to be an expert on their beliefs, but even I know that by breaking with its long time Syndicate alliance, it is only a matter of time before they are reabsorbed back into their faith’s proper doctrine. That’s either going to happen because we will eventually manage to do enough harm that they’ll beg for help from their father temple in Delantium or they’ll slowly be forced back into submission when the Syndicate eventually starts pushing their weight here. That is what they’re doing aren’t they?” Heather says. <EOS>
<BOS> “They weren’t, but I guess when word got around about what happened with the Black Hooks, the independents formed a loose alliance. They call themselves the Jicol Coalition of Rogues.” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “But even a friendly dragon can crush a village whenever it feels like it. I know someone like you probably cherishes the freedom that most living outside the law come to embrace. But I tell you now that living outside the law is nothing compared to using it to rule over others. Bending it to your will as you see fit and never having to answer for it. Why? Because you make the rules and they’re completely legitimate. Don’t be a villager living near a friendly dragon, BE the dragon.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well you do this for me, and you can consider us even. We can even have a fresh start.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe so, but I’m just not sure I want that lot incorporated into our organization.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You know there are blood stalkers out here and bandits who…” <EOS>
<BOS> Tom at this point walks with you to entrance back to the sewer where he gives you directions to the next closest exit to the city streets from there. He then mentions a few cheap inns in the area you should end up in. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fucking kidding me? What the hell now?” the woman asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, never mind. So you’re saying Fel isn’t going to bother us at all?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Dustan Palmer." You hope he hasn't heard your name, as there might be some friction if he finds you are a storyteller. <EOS>
<BOS> The bum falls to the ground, and then the other tries to run, but you easily shoot him as well. <EOS>
<BOS> “So where are we getting these slaves anyway?” <EOS>
<BOS> There is some strange magic at work here and it’s obviously best if you didn’t fuck around with it. You play it safe and release the crown. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well, it would seem the goal is clear. I'll go have a talk with these siblings about the facts of life." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, you have my permission, however, and this is very important. When you talk to Fel tonight, I want you to ask him who is going to take you away so you know what they look like.” <EOS>
<BOS> In the meantime, you hand over Annah’s share. <EOS>
<BOS> "Starve them?" you gasp. <EOS>
<BOS> You face Mr. Reynolds who stands up from his desk. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re busy making mental images, you’ve neglected to cover yourself and this woman has been doing the same to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Demon! I AM in charge here! I COMMAND YOU in Dorna’s name to perform my task!” <EOS>
<BOS> He hears what you were charged with and just shakes his head. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, okay. So Layla, do you have any other family? I mean besides the ones that those pirates killed?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ok, fine.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Some big guy probably in his forties or fifties, with a bushy beard, shaved head and weathered face came in and started asking everyone about you like he was the fucking Klyton Militia, put everyone on fucking edge.” <EOS>
<BOS> Still, doesn’t prevent you from being a little nosey and you look through some of her belonging that are more out in open. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, cost of living. Or more specially Klyton raising property taxes to put it into security of the city. Your Bloody Talon pals have really been raising hell lately.” Hank replies. <EOS>
<BOS> You go over to the sideways carriage, climb on top it and open the door. Looking downward, you see that Elana is still in a semi-prone position opposite of you. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s just as well that you soon die from internal head trauma since Tanya isn’t even successful in retrieving your body. <EOS>
<BOS> Immediately Sneaks shakes his head. <EOS>
<BOS> (You’re still having trouble thinking up a good name though) <EOS>
<BOS> Vera takes a drink of the rum she’s brought with her from Jicol before continuing. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re always so reserved. But if you’re really insisting on going, be careful and don’t lead the charge.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, if we’re pressing potential deadbeats into fights, that’s sort of like enslaving them isn’t it?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yep, looks like you’re conquering the rest of the virgin territory tonight. Hope that’s not too much pressure, but then why would it be? Not like I can compare you to anyone else right?” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, we’re hired to protect that caravan, not baby sit every stranger along the way.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, you certainly like to stare.” Ludmilla says, noticing your examination. <EOS>
<BOS> You also say you can easily provide skirmish support as your group is very familiar with the city and the sewers in particular. You’d be able to help pick off Ludmilla’s troops. <EOS>
<BOS> "You've done well," he says, "very well for us. Feel free to sail with us again." <EOS>
<BOS> "Hurry along, now." Spryce says, and gestures you down through a hatch and ladder into another room below deck. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sucks how much you have to do around here and you’re practically doing it all yourself.” <EOS>
<BOS> “…but still…this is like a really big thing. I mean you barely know me and this is going to really help me out.” You say still in disbelief of your luck. <EOS>
<BOS> “You mean in the university?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well when the rest of us were coming back from the job, he apparently got into an argument with the boss. A really bad one about how he didn’t like the way Edmond was running things. It didn’t go well for either of them. Edmond might have been old, but he managed to overpower David and killed him. Unfortunately I guess it was all a bit too much exertion, because the boss died of a heart attack like almost immediately afterwards.” <EOS>
<BOS> You go to your room and after moving about furniture to access your items, you check everything and load it all up. You then get some rest, because tomorrow you’ve got big plans. <EOS>
<BOS> “And me?” <EOS>
<BOS> You grab Zal's hand, squeezing it while nodding silently. It's all you have to do to give an answer. Zal seems pretty happy with your answer and hugs you which you return. <EOS>
<BOS> “And get myself fucking killed?! No thanks! One of the big reasons my mother never told anyone or even tried to get financial support from the Baron is the fear of some assassin coming in to kill her and me. I mean I’m hardly the only illegitimate child the baron probably had and his son Farad was notorious for having suspected bastards killed. And if he didn’t do it, I can’t imagine Ludmilla was any different. Especially now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, yes, we all know. You cleverly lied, cheated, stole and murdered your way to your position. You’re the epitome of a self made man. We’re all very impressed. Truly. I’m wet just thinking about it. Still, I really think you should go to this party, if only so you don’t inadvertently offend her which then will cause our current friendly relationship with the law to become unnecessarily complicated.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I have already mourned over my family and continue to do so in the night when I cry myself to sleep. However, it is said that Ahamed has a reason for every event. I am hoping that I might see and understand this one and from there gain greater wisdom. My own family owned a few slaves for basic tasks, perhaps I am to learn how they felt.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh no. This one’s on me. No charge at all and I’ll just make up the difference elsewhere. Honestly, I wanted to reward you before, but I missed you the first time you came here and then you never came back here until tonight.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I can’t stay here.” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> To get your mind off it, you focus on your other problem, which is the curse you’re still dealing with. Honestly, if it hadn’t been for that, things might have been different with Vera in the first place. <EOS>
<BOS> Roaring, you look up to see the Emperor himself riding atop a wyvern. The beast flaps its wings in the air, bearing its fangs in your direction. A golden mask stares at you, as if contemplating the outcome. The Emperor, wearing a mask of gold, commands the wyvern forward, flying over both armies, abandoning his. The wyvern becomes a small dot in the distance, and the defending force, crippled by the sight of their leader fleeing, lay down their arms in surrender. <EOS>
<BOS> "I don't mean to be presumptuous," you say to Spryce, "but I do know some basic first aid. If it could be any help." <EOS>
<BOS> “We’re doing okay I suppose, but I’m still not sure if bum fight gambling and going back to selling Yellow Devil was the way to go about it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why not both? Look I can see you’re in a bit of a hurry to sell off your loot, so how about this token of good will, I’ll give you five platinum pieces what you got in your bag.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re sort of glad you didn’t join up with them now, because at this rate, the militia is probably going to track them down and execute the lot of them. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes. Oh don't worry, I'm not going to interrupt anything, we're still moving all incriminating evidence out of here, but we're just doing it permanently." Zalmora responds. <EOS>
<BOS> Just as you’re about to ask Warts another question about the Thieves’ Guild, Warts finds what you’re looking for and when he does so a large bolt just whizzes over his head and into the wall behind him. <EOS>
<BOS> You begin swearing and shouting orders, desperately trying to adjust your eyes to the darkness. You already hear noises of men being killed and unfortunately they sound like yours. <EOS>
<BOS> “Pfft, they’re cowardly gutter scum at heart that’s why they rove in packs and are part of a bullshit gang and did you see how they were dressed? Fucking rags, no way they could even afford a firearm.” <EOS>
<BOS> You ask around and after exchanging a bit of coin, a Hessla merchant ship (They do exist contrary to popular belief) agrees to take you to Jicol. Apparently it’s a city state on a fairly large island to the west. It’s about the only place that Hessla pirates never fuck with due to the well-trained navy and the fact that Jicol has made it quite clear that any attack on their ships or city will result in total war with Hessla and it isn’t one the pirate town would win. <EOS>
<BOS> “Y’know, YOU don’t need to be out here at all considering you apparently threw me under the horse and cart and you’re not even in any trouble for any of this!” <EOS>
<BOS> "So um...Zal..." You start to say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, but at the arena, people don’t have the deal with the bums they’ve bet on to puke in the middle of the ring and pass out causing the other to win by default.” Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> Heather opens a hole in the barrier, which you step through. Before you make your way back home, Heather asks if you can wait a moment and then runs back inside the temple. You’re not exactly sure what Heather is up to, but you put some space between you and the barrier in the meantime. <EOS>
<BOS> “Indeed. However, I’d say staying put and getting too comfortable like a fat lazy cat is likely to get one eventually grabbed by the scruff, put in a bag and thrown in a river.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, but…” <EOS>
<BOS> Just as you’re about to start round five, the door opens! You forgot to lock it and suddenly it’s like that time you were a teenager and your sister walked in on you accidently. (Man, that was awkward) <EOS>
<BOS> "Destroy you? Why? How could they?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Relax, it wasn’t an insult, but tell me Marco, where do you see the Black Hooks in five years?” <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s enough you two,” Brother Samuel interjects. “You’re both right. I think you should continue to train together. Kassi, you’re one of our top acolytes. It’s almost unheard of for someone your age to train at the intermediate level. You could teach a lot to our friend here. In return, you’ll get more experience with a physically stronger opponent.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You crushed my girlfriend you fucker!” you shout. <EOS>
<BOS> Legend has it that the dragon was eventually slain by a great hero, but that its treasure was never found. Every so often, wandering adventurers pass through the area and enter the old growth looking for that treasure, but none have ever returned. Almost always, they first stop to visit the hobbled old mage Kragan Firehand at his tower on Dagger Hill, before heading into the forest to their doom. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not going,” Kassi firmly states. <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera just stop. This isn’t going to work.” You say pushing her away a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t ask if you if you were currently with anyone either.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Who knows. Hey, how about you play something on your flute?” you say quickly changing the subject. <EOS>
<BOS> "Of course! Even the non-initiated are welcome here. Would you like the tour?" <EOS>
<BOS> “I know the general area of where he’s probably located and I know Jake. He’s not going to be hard to find for me. See you later maybe.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m…(wheeze) fine…I’ll take that water though.” You struggle to say. <EOS>
<BOS> Lacking anything else to do, you head back to the inn and get back to work, which still feels weird to you. Though more than anything else your mind is preoccupied with if that ogre freak is going to be successful. You have a little anxiety that he's not going to get the job done and one of those assholes gets away only to shoot you in the back a year later just when you think everything is going good. <EOS>
<BOS> “The Bloody Smiles are lead by a vicious bandit calling himself the Grinning Man. Nobody has gotten a really good look at him as most don’t survive his attacks, but based on this crude sketch, I implore anyone seeing him to run and contact Klyton militia immediately! This man and his band of cutthroats have been plaguing the roads and the surrounding area for years and hopefully now that his identity is known…” <EOS>
<BOS> Vera suddenly goes into more of her life story than you ever thought to ask of her. <EOS>
<BOS> You weren’t aware Zalmora had any kind of attraction to you before, but it’s definitely apparent now. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? Where that guy in the hood is sitting?” <EOS>
<BOS> The next night, with all your gear, you head to the nearest sewer entrance and descend down. You still remember the way to the Thieves Guild so it doesn’t take long. <EOS>
<BOS> "Um, yeah. I think Rob is just a bit nervous being within your presence. You know how you have a reputation and all boss." Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, I got those bullets and that cleaning kit you wanted.” Sinin says. <EOS>
<BOS> “We don’t need to open up a front, because they’ve already made it quite clear that they’ve already done so. I don’t know about anyone else, but every time I bump into those fanatics they attack on sight.” Sneaks says. <EOS>
<BOS> “I see. And you felt that she deserved this horrible fate?” <EOS>
<BOS> You just put your face in the palms of your hands. <EOS>
<BOS> “What’s this?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> "OH SHIT RUN!" Zal shouts and makes haste towards the room's exit as the ceiling begins to completely collapse. Vaughn follows suit, leaving Rob who has either been knocked unconscious or killed. <EOS>
<BOS> The people here do not seem to be the shouting type, so you glance around you for inspiration. The setting makes you think of exotic tales and impossibly beautiful places. Perhaps an ancient hanging garden, and a princess, would suit the sensibilities of these richer folks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera I really don’t want to, can we just get on with this…” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re so damn delirious that at one point in between the huffing and puffing and panting and dirty talk you suddenly blurt out: <EOS>
<BOS> When you explain this to Shade however, he’s less than enthusiastic about your rather laid back plan. <EOS>
<BOS> You rush into your arms. "No sweeter sorrow," you murmur as your papery skin crumbles like sawdust. There is no pain. You will not live to see it, and in moments will be only dust and tears on the wind, but Ivani will return. She is your life story, the one tale you refuse to let go. Surely, she will find a way to save the dreamless world. <EOS>
<BOS> “Rook, I’m telling you the damn truth.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, ever since dey got their asses kicked hard by da elves and lost a good portion of the tribe, there’s been sum serious re-thinkin’ on how things are gonna work now. Anyway, just wunderin’ if they can join.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Excuse me.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You take your leave to head up to your room, you figure you’ll stay in a couple days waiting for Yinen’s payment. You’ve got enough to take a break for a while. <EOS>
<BOS> “Man, good thing Yag lissened to me.” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey a shooty. Dis what the humie was threatin’ you wit?” the hobgoblin asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Me? Nah…too much humie blood. Can’t ever be part of tribe proper. Good thing mum good fighter and loves me, otherwise tribe probably would ‘ave eaten me when I was born.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Gut him? I thought we were just removing him from power.” Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Honestly, you aren’t sure about all this. While Heather has brought up some concerning points. The Felians ARE your allies and granted in this business such things can be fleeting, you start stabbing them in the back and where does it end? You also aren’t so sure about replacing a solid known ally with an uncertain one, especially if they aren’t exactly any better than the ones you have. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I oughta do worse than throw fucking apples at you!” <EOS>
<BOS> No sooner that you do so that you feel like you’re falling and then you suddenly back in the museum room again and the crown is back in its case with the glass once again intact. <EOS>
<BOS> "Vaughn told me, you had natural talent and were well respected by the mining company because of it." <EOS>
<BOS> “Pfft. He wished. Look, I get that the dumb asses in town thought I was a whore, but Klint was repulsive…besides he was always sniffing around your sister while she was still around. Never paid any attention to me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Dangerous to go around trusting the lot we associate with, but something about her bothers me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait…you saying Fel fucked my wife and this is actually his son?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s Klint and ever since your sister left, he’s been even more of an asshole to you and you’re not really sure why. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sometimes? But what if today is that day?” <EOS>
<BOS> You verbally order your men to stand down, but approach slowly as you push Percy’s body off of you. Toz stands back and keeps his guard up. Eventually you both return to the original room where you find everyone dead. You also see Marco lying near another body face down. <EOS>
<BOS> "Definitely sounds like a better idea, but I know what place you're talking about, and it seems a little on the small side, I was thinking some place bigger like my old family's inn which is still abandoned. We wouldn't have to deal with anyone." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> This causes a few chuckles from Ponyride’s cohorts, but you maintain your composure and simply utter the phrase. <EOS>
<BOS> With the captain in tow (And shouting in your wax filled ear) you make your way to the rowboat, get in and deploy it. It drops a lot faster than you intended and you land hard, but there is no damage and all you get is a little wet from the splash back. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re almost speechless right now. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point the guard Annah’s been speaking to, wipes his eye. He then puts a hand in his pocket. <EOS>
<BOS> “No problem. Just the location will do. It’s not ideal, but I have more than enough confidence that we’ll be able to take it anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> Seems like you'd fit in real well. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, we can accommodate that, and I know just the right girl too. Head on upstairs third door on your right. She’ll be with you soon.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I got a better idea. Let’s just wait for Keira to come back home.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> That first year was really hard though. You sometimes didn’t know if you were going to make it or not. It wasn’t really the survival aspect, but more the mental aspect. True you didn’t exactly have a “good life” in your own time, but you still had ties. <EOS>
<BOS> "Those are the horses that play Emperor's Circle in Malong Field every day," they replied, "and are favorites among the town." <EOS>
<BOS> You get home to the Welcome Mat and bump into Trobart, the crusty owner of the place. He gives you a dirty look like he gives you all the time. <EOS>
<BOS> And while you don’t actually mind all that, what you do wish is that you didn’t have to concern yourself with potentially stumbling into Ebony Claw Syndicate territory, which according to most of them is basically the entire city. They’re more of a danger than the Holgard Watch. <EOS>
<BOS> “This seems a bit unprotected.” You say looking around for potential traps. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah, nice try, but there are still questions out on you.” <EOS>
<BOS> Seth begins to whisper into a ring on his finger and punches his fist to the ground. Waves of flame fire from the position and sweep into the surrounding soldiers. Kassi screams at the collateral damage. The books in the area instantly light up and the fire begins to spread. With the fire spreading, you exit the library following Seth. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, okay here and now. Yeah, that’s definitely enough. But…I’m just wondering what’s going to happen as time goes on. I mean you’re a demon so I assume you’re immortal on some level and I’m dead and here in soul form or whatever it is. I mean this is forever. How long before you get tired of me? Will you eventually discard the last remnants of your humanity and just throw me in a pain tower or something as soon as I anger you in some way? I mean how much time to we really have? Should I prepare myself for the inevitable?” <EOS>
<BOS> "So I trust our business is concluded and you're satisfied with the results?" Mr. Reynolds asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay! Fuck! I dunno! I mean I guess we want to be pirates.” <EOS>
<BOS> You go to your room and pack all your shit. In particular all the firearms you’ve acquired and head to another inn to get a night’s rest before taking on the slavers. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr. Reynolds begins to move closer towards you, studying you even. <EOS>
<BOS> “Had to Flameflower, opportunity arose and we needed to seize it. And it paid off! Look!” <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re doing that however, you’re also studying some of the lay out of the palace, or at least what you’re able to. You also take notice of what valuable objects would be easy to take. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I’m glad you see it that way and I would also remind you that while perhaps many of your numbers have been decimated, not all of them have and you already have a great system in place to draw from. I mean your brothels alone should be a beacon of information.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Damnit, Gubbins! I told ya ta wait in da corridor!” Warts reprimands the child. <EOS>
<BOS> “You shouldn’t need to. However, I can do this enchantment on any item. So if you brought in a ring, which might be a more secure item for your son to wear in the future, it won’t cost anything as long as you stick to the deal. You don’t however and you can forget about me doing you any sort of business with you ever again.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, your words did help rein me in a bit. You were right, no need to take unnecessary chances if I don’t need to, hence why I just left.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “He was gross. Breathing heavy and touching my legs, it was all I could do not to vomit…y’know you could have defended my honor.” <EOS>
<BOS> “But…how do I know you won’t believe me and torture me anyway?” <EOS>
<BOS> That’s how you’re justifying that one anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> Before any of them can make a move or sound other than a scream, you’ve shot your blunderbuss and taken out three of them with the spread. You finish off the fourth severely wounded one on the ground with blade to his neck. <EOS>
<BOS> “Now, I doubt either side is going to remain hidden for very long from each other but as soon as we attack, the Inquisitor will soon intervene directly and then we’ll be at a complete disadvantage.” Shade says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Probably the safest bet for you. Though of course you realize I’m going to catch the fallout of this plan of yours. In fact I’ll probably somehow get blamed for it.” <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t bother arguing; you already know what you have to do. You need to just take out Elias and after you do that, you’ll have your own place, everyone else will fall in line and that will be that. Patience and diplomacy have failed. <EOS>
<BOS> “So I take it you’re not worried about this and siding with Ludmilla?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Five plat?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey what’s that supposed to mean?” Marco asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Guess that’s for when bandits attack?” you ask the driver. <EOS>
<BOS> “Remind me again, what are the different categories?” <EOS>
<BOS> Initially this all seemed pretty ideal, as you were no longer under their threats or watchful eye and at the time the Holgard Watch was still fairly weak and recovering from the anarchy. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright, alright, Kol. I’m not mad. Calm down. In fact, you calm down as well, you’re not getting sold anytime soon Layla.” You say addressing the both of them. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, but for better or worse, the man WAS my father in a way. I mean ignoring all the rest of his unwanted feelings, I do remember the positives. Despite all that, I haven’t even cried. Shouldn’t I cry?” <EOS>
<BOS> “How big exactly?” Shade asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Jake! Stop! You made your point!” Zalmora shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not really.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You shouldn’t be here,” a voice projects from behind him. <EOS>
<BOS> This is just bizarre. You didn't expect this sort of request. Annie's correct in that she's not ugly, but her stringy greasy looking hair, plain looks, and emaciated appearance aren't exactly traits that come to mind when you're thinking of attractiveness. Though apparently she finds you attractive which is always a nice ego boost. <EOS>
<BOS> “Damn right I did. Did you really think you were going to get away with it? Did you really think that was going to work?” <EOS>
<BOS> Since you aren’t exactly sure how to contact Rook, the only place you can think of to go is the Poison Blade Inn since that’s the best known Ebony Claw Syndicate hang out. <EOS>
<BOS> “Is that right Lou? Let me see what you got that’s so great and why you fucking felt the need to attack without me.” A voice suddenly says. <EOS>
<BOS> The only thing you do have concerns about is…well the whole slavery thing. You don’t profess to be a saint of Joachim, but this seems a bit too far even for you. You aren’t even sure where you’re going to be getting these slaves from in the first place. <EOS>
<BOS> Drawing on a lifetime of training as well as several cups of mead, Brother Samuel calmly walks towards the movement. Nearing the origin of the movement, Samuel suddenly feels the presence of someone, or something. Then he sees it. A boy lies collapsed in the grass. His clothes are tattered and several deep scratches line his arms and legs. His skin appears dark, although closer observation reveals it to be dirt. <EOS>
<BOS> Funny how Warts is content on letting you do all the exploration. He could have easily been searching the upstairs while you were stumbling upon sacrificial captives. <EOS>
<BOS> The other commanders overhearing the words from your mouth visibly object. They know you and Seth well enough to know the actions and words from your mouth aren’t your own. As one, weapons are pulled from their resting positions. Seth stands before you, the commanders of your army behind him. The man in the crimson robe, the man who you’ve followed your entire life, raises his sword to end your life. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well calm down it’s not actually bad, or at least not actively bad.” <EOS>
<BOS> The crowd is unusually silent as you finish, perhaps because the story was more somber than your usual fare. The children shift on their bottoms as if bored, though a few of the adults look thoughtful. The air shimmers, as it often does after a story has been read or told, and you feel the twisting sensation that always accompanies the loss of a story. It is as if something out there is eating the tales as they are told, so that no one else can ever say them again. <EOS>
<BOS> Shade’s people are unable to simply teleport or even turn invisible. A few barely manage to find cover before the beams of light completely ignite the unfortunate ones that couldn’t escape. <EOS>
<BOS> “Poison? Really? I would have thought if it was going to be you, you’d probably stab me while in the middle of sex.” <EOS>
<BOS> When Tanya is here though, you’ll better be able to take advantage of the situation. You just hope you haven’t misjudged her and she’ll actually rethink her position on attacking Rook, though if enough time passes, you’re going to just have to risk acting on your own anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay…you can…loosen up…a bit…” Vera gasps. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Tom stops slouching and begins to move towards you as much as he can in his cage. <EOS>
<BOS> You exit the carriage and your agent is soon there to greet you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, never had dat problem. Anywayz I was askin’ where ya gonna hold dis meetin’ of Holgard’s most wanted, an when?” <EOS>
<BOS> Your natural instinct to just keep going in a straight line like you were doing, but unfortunately for you, the path completely disappears into forest. Doesn’t help that the road also branches into several paths that twist in different directions. You weren’t expecting that so you aren’t sure which way to go. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait a minute, what the hell happened to you a few moments ago? In fact what the hell happened to you period?” <EOS>
<BOS> While this seems to really do it for Vera, you still think this is a really bad idea considering that she may very well really die after all this. <EOS>
<BOS> "I thank you," the serpent hissed, wondering if she understood the true gift she had given him was not beauty, but persuasion. In this form, he would be as beguiling to the eye as he already was with his tongue. <EOS>
<BOS> “Come on get up!” you say momentarily stopping. <EOS>
<BOS> The next morning, you’re put back on the cart and continue your journey to Sivak. You reach your destination by midday. Sivak is larger than anything you’ve ever seen and some of its buildings are very impressive. It’s a very bustling place with people walking around everywhere. You just wish you were free to enjoy it. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m sure, but I’m not interested…” <EOS>
<BOS> Not that you were going to though since Vera’s words have convinced you that everything will indeed be fine, or at least manageable. You aren’t sure what sort of father you’re going to make, but you suppose you’ll find out. <EOS>
<BOS> With that plan in motion, it’s business as usual in the organization. <EOS>
<BOS> “Damn right I do. Which is why I didn’t kill you immediately even though I could tell you had your own agenda against the Ebony Claw Syndicate the first time I met you. Now here I am dealing with you again despite our temple’s break from alliances with the unworthy.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Times are harder since the Ebony Claw moved in, and I won’t lie, there is a war going on. And there is also strength and protection in numbers. <EOS>
<BOS> Upon opening the door, you see your son fidgeting in his seat his in front of his spell book. He looks up and over at you before quickly returning to his book. Glad to see he knows that you really want him to focus on his studies. <EOS>
<BOS> “Your call. Apologies.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It is? I thought it was a brothel. Good thing it isn’t though because I don’t need a blowjob that badly.” You say, then you look over at the girl with him. <EOS>
<BOS> You still miss her in some ways. <EOS>
<BOS> “Apologies, I’ve almost got him quiet.” You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look out behind you!” Annah shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sheesh, if I’d known you’d become such a fucking asshole, I woulda left ya ta rot in the woods years ago. Alright, fine. I’ll help, but only becuz I ain’t got anything better ta do right now. I ain’t getting’ tied down in dis little organization of yers either, assumin’ it even gets off da ground to begin wit. So whatcha need?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Heh, neither of those. Known a lot of killers that don’t look the part. Also known a lot of killers younger than yourself. Just having a hard time believing it because of who your father is. While your father certainly wasn’t some goody two shoes as a kid, he certainly didn’t go seeking out major trouble. Never did anything illegal as far as I know. I sort of figured if he ever had kids of his own, he’d teach them the same.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I mean I know you. You typically think things out before making any major decisions, surely you must have considered that this was just in your head and you weren’t cursed?” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> But you didn’t make this trip for nothing, so you take a deep breath and head up the steps to the door and then suddenly your arms are grabbed by two Felians who suddenly appear. <EOS>
<BOS> "What is this?" she asks of the glass rocking horse. "I have countless perfumes." <EOS>
<BOS> “Well we can take care of that right now, and you don’t have enough bullets to kill us all.” <EOS>
<BOS> And especially the brothels… <EOS>
<BOS> You slip behind the curtains and head for the passage, hearing voices shout in anger and dismay behind you. No doubt they expected to find the High Mage. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya…Tanya…please….” You say and hang your head down in an effort to look defeated. <EOS>
<BOS> You snap out of your killing trance for a moment and see you’ve made quite the mess. You stand up breathing heavily. <EOS>
<BOS> You start to listen carefully. <EOS>
<BOS> And then the Inquisitor finally makes his arrival. You’ve never seen the guy before, but he certainly makes an impression especially since he emanates a white light from his person making him visible to all even in this darkness. He looks exactly like how Shade described him, though he’s also carrying a mace in his hand. <EOS>
<BOS> “I do and so does Ludmilla. I mean she might be a bit flakey at times, but the woman is not dim. She’s been making her own preparations and so have we. Honestly I’m sort of surprised given your new connections to the Ebony Claw, you would have learned of this plan long ago.” <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re waiting for that meeting, you keep going back and forth on when you should tell your own people about this. You figure that you should probably at least wait until after the meeting since it doesn’t do any good getting them in a tizzy if things don’t work out. You anticipate that it’s going to be a mixed reaction at best. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah. Funny guy. I’d rather fry my own brain than have the even more thankless task of running a city. I have enough on my hands running a school.” <EOS>
<BOS> You tell Rook the same story you told the Shadow Blade outside and try to remain as calm as possible the whole time. You manage, but it’s stressful as hell as Rook is studying you the entire time along with Bolt staring at you with that typical grim dwarven expression and even this Lloyd person who occasionally makes a brief frown. <EOS>
<BOS> “You seem to know a lot about the Felians.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I’m serious. I know enough about Mr. Reynolds through my dad that I don’t want to have deal with him. And as you said, he’s probably going to have some sort of weird catch as part of the agreement he isn’t going to reveal until afterwards. At least with the lizard I’ll know where I stand right away.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you the one who stabbed her?” your father asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I thought about heading to Hessla, but that place is overrun by pirates nowadays. Spending days at sea isn’t exactly my thing. Nah, Klyton’s my home and for better or worse I’m staying here.” <EOS>
<BOS> Of course doing that might not go over well either and you’d tip your hand pretty severely. Might be better to talk to Peter first and get all the information from him and then go speak to Heather so you’d at least have something that might be useful to her if worse came to worst in your meeting. <EOS>
<BOS> "I guess shortly after we both left. I think he's about twenty or around that age. He's okay, a bit on the straight laced side. Guess mom and dad finally got the well behaved child they always wanted." <EOS>
<BOS> The Grandmaster steps to the very edge of the cliff. The mountain wind carries his robe as if a cape behind him. His arms move through the air as his lips speak the spell into existence. An outline of a door appears just off the cliff’s edge. <EOS>
<BOS> “As you say.” You reply, still looking around. <EOS>
<BOS> “You guys seem to have a handle on that, besides don’t really feel like celebrating with Jake.” You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> And like most guys your age (Or guys in general) you make your most important decision with your dick. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well I want to be on the safe side. My people are going to remain outside anyway, you know just in case any try to escape. I’ll come in with your people. Speaking of which are you really bringing them all?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “We need to talk bro.” your sister says. <EOS>
<BOS> Before you can get another word in, Vera suddenly throws the rest of her drink in your face and springs from your couch and tries to run for the front door. She doesn’t get far though thanks to her balance not being the best due to her alcohol intake. She trips and slams hard on the floor and then promptly throws up as well. <EOS>
<BOS> You stand your ground with your fists up, and Tanya runs towards you. You throw another punch, but she dodges and gives you a swift punch to your stomach and knocks all the wind out of you. Now while you’re hunched over trying to catch your breath, she grabs your throat with one hand and your balls with the other. <EOS>
<BOS> “If you’re going to interrupt me, don’t just stand there. What’s going on?” Captain Wren speaks, throwing on his light set of armor. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, you lot are going with these wizards to the palace. I want you to do everything in your power to protect them. Seriously, it’s the most important thing in the world right now.” You say and start walking off. <EOS>
<BOS> “Mhmm,” Mira agrees not sure what to say. <EOS>
<BOS> ut wooden hangers one of which you grab as a weapon just in case. <EOS>
<BOS> “Real world being the key word here. Are you listening to yourself? Look, I don’t know what to tell you man, I mean…(sigh) okay say for the sake of argument this IS all true, have you even spoken to her directly about it?” <EOS>
<BOS> Of course he might think now that you’ll be able to talk Tanya into switching sides too. He didn’t seem convinced you’d be able to do it, but then maybe it’s a small effort on his part for large potential gain. <EOS>
<BOS> Madeline looks up and stands. <EOS>
<BOS> “You want me to take even them?” Warts asks pointing at your hob bodyguards. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you sure?” <EOS>
<BOS> "What about an inventor of some kind? The Empress loves novelty." <EOS>
<BOS> Flynt wishes you good luck and returns to finishing up his drink. His friends are doing likewise and you take that as your sign to leave the table. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 34 <EOS>
<BOS> "Come on! Leave it! Let's just go!" Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m guessing you had something in mind for them to specifically do?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya! I’ve never…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey you thieving asshole, I hope you stole enough to make rent this month because I’m raising it.” He suddenly says. <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sigh) Why do I feel like I’m the only one who cares about this organization?” <EOS>
<BOS> Year 17 <EOS>
<BOS> "Don't insult me with more lies. I already saw what was going on at my tavern. In all her hysterics yesterday, I heard Annie babble to me about how she has a handsome man that loves her more than I ever did. I have to imagine that's probably you since you stand out a bit from the rest of the unwashed rabble I saw in that den of inequity. Ungrateful little bitch. Well, whatever charms you think you have ain't gonna work on me, I'm a Joachim fearing woman! Tch. Gotta say I never thought your parents would raise someone so far from the path of righteousness." <EOS>
<BOS> You and Zalmora go back to your room and get into it pretty quickly. You also learn a few things, which is a fun process even if she’s a bit bossy about it. Eventually you’re entirely spent and satisfied. <EOS>
<BOS> While this seems to come to no surprise to some of the people, and others grumble a bit, but you’re one of the few that begins yelling loudly. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’ll get no argument from me there,” Seth says with a smile. <EOS>
<BOS> “What do you mean?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why not just get rid of her then?” <EOS>
<BOS> "No, I suppose that would be fine...but I dunno about this..." <EOS>
<BOS> In any case your struggles with metaphysical matters soon turn into very real struggles because your carriage (along with the rest) are suddenly attacked! <EOS>
<BOS> The door swings open revealing a room lined with bookcases. There isn’t a single bare wall. As his presence is detected, torches light up illuminating the entire room in their blue glow. Samuel places his cane on the center table and begins to search for the book he came for. <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t make out everything they say in between the beating, but you think you understood some of the words as older forms of various swears. You also heard “emperor” which is very bad since as far as you can figure, the crown belongs to the emperor of Galpatis Empire. <EOS>
<BOS> It probably also caused enough water to flood everything and rise high enough to start flooding the nearby area as well. <EOS>
<BOS> “How law abiding of you. (Sigh) I don’t suppose it would help if I said Annah’s lying about that.” <EOS>
<BOS> As you leave Hank with his dilemma, you think to yourself, things could always be worse. <EOS>
<BOS> Ekk’a crept silently forward, his sun-weathered hand tightly around his crude bow. The hunt had taken him far away from the tribe, too far, but the buck would be his. He would return to his people with enough meat to eat for several days. It was his duty to provide for his people. His light barefoot steps don’t snap twigs or rustle fallen leaves. They’re quiet, born of a lifetime of practice. At the age of ten, it was the tribe’s tradition to send a boy coming into manhood into the wilderness, alone, with only a week’s worth of supplies. They could return in a month, any attempt to return earlier would be met with shame on the entire family. The tribe had no place for weak men. <EOS>
<BOS> With your pants now back on, you approach Tanya, who stares at you from the circle. She doesn’t look pleased, but then you aren’t sure if that’s just here natural look now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not really, just wondered if we pissed him off by using his temple for something other than worship.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re actually so surprised by Warts exclamation that you don’t even try to shoot him, you just try to follow him as you also run through the trees. <EOS>
<BOS> You attempt to avoid potential trouble by taking the quieter side streets. Midway through you half wonder if you should have just used the sewers until you got closer to the front gate, but it’s too late now. <EOS>
<BOS> Since you seem to be messing up on your lies right now, you just go ahead and confirm his suspicions. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…” you say still looking at Jake before walking past. <EOS>
<BOS> In the meantime you mostly wait around in your headquarters getting reports from people while the chaos goes on above. Warts surprisingly has stuck by your side rather than running off though he says he was sorely tempted. Things just aren’t quite grim enough for him to do it yet though. <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile you go over the other incapacitated bandit and finish him off by slitting his throat. By the time you’ve done that, Warts has already finished off the other one. <EOS>
<BOS> "Follow me. Hope you have some extra coin." The two of you leave and weave your way through the circle of tents until you find one near the edge. <EOS>
<BOS> “As I said, that’s not why I’m here. I’m here on behalf of the Ebony Claw Syndicate, not the Order of Fel. I was given no instructions by them or their god, and even if I was, my loyalty is always with the Syndicate first. They really do want a deal. Any past animosity you may or may not have had with them has been waved. This is business and everyone involved can make lots of money.” Toz says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ten fucking silvers? You don’t charge that much for a blowjob!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well…maybe she gave me a disease? Like demon crotch rot or something?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Wow, so who's this one?" Your sister asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good, because I’m sure you realize that it would be bad for you if you did rat on us to anyone.” Tom says in a tone that’s slightly more hostile than he’s been towards you. <EOS>
<BOS> “After what you did, you have the balls to ask me that? You fucking LEFT me. Left me with my asshole father and my long lost bitch of a mother! Left me with no explanation or even support!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course. Shit.” You say and quicken your pace and the corpses do likewise. <EOS>
<BOS> “It was good of course, but definitely more intense. What about you?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thieves Guild. Thought you guys didn’t have turf.” You say not really relaxing too much. <EOS>
<BOS> “But boss…” Marco says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, maybe I’m a little obsessed, but not in the way you’re saying.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, I’m having a difficult time as it is trying not to be all over you right now, so here’s the short version.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Just some extra passenger that paid coin.” Flint responds. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why do we need Scales to assassinate Jake anyway? I mean I told you that I think it’s a better idea to just let Jake continue rampaging through the woods to take the heat off of us.” Zal asks. <EOS>
<BOS> "She's willing to sell, so no murder was necessary." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You look at Heather as she looks at you. <EOS>
<BOS> The pair of you walk out of the village and in this light and at this range, you see his face better and something about him looks very familiar. <EOS>
<BOS> “I just got what they sell here at the inn. I want to make sure you’ve got your strength up for tonight’s assault on the Guild. I know I drained you during our…closeness last night. I really didn’t mean to.” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera…what the hell? This isn’t even making any sense! I was direct with you multiple times if you recall. As I remember I never even lead you on in any way. And for the record I was not fucking Heather. In any case I hardly see how that’s an excuse for you trying to have me killed!” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m a cynic so I’m guessing you’re here to say you’re taking over and this is my one warning to get out of the way. At best, you’ll want me to still stick around. At worst, you’ve probably already poisoned me when you touched my hand.” <EOS>
<BOS> The Cathedral was commissioned long ago by a King, one who actually served the One God and would have shunned its dark turn. But his small nation was overwhelmed by barbarian hordes from the south, and for centuries the Cathedral was passed through the hands of mercenary overlords, bandit kings, and minor nobles. <EOS>
<BOS> The next day, you surprisingly wake up in the afternoon. Tanya apparently has been awake for quite awhile though, but she’s basically been watching you sleep for most of that time. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s a terrible idea, we’re going to need all the firepower we can get!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera! Shit! We REALLY can’t do this! You WILL die!” you say, but still holding on to her body tightly. <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad you asked. You see, while Warts was inviting you all here in a civilized manner to join me, I was planning for all of our futures.” You say before you’re interrupted. <EOS>
<BOS> “Mm, and you said you haven’t had any trouble from the Ebony Claw Syndicate?” <EOS>
<BOS> Well, you can think with one head or the other, but you can’t do both. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck you. You’re nobody important and I’d wager the ECS would look MORE favorable on me by culling their ranks of pieces of shit that can’t even do their job right.” You say, and then shoot him twice in the head. <EOS>
<BOS> “Boss…ugh…dying…” he utters spitting up a little blood. <EOS>
<BOS> You head downstairs and find that the inn has the usual crowd with one important difference. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re free to leave. Though I’d suggest that you go get a regular job like a barrel maker or go try to be a cabin boy on a pirate ship and pursue that dream because as I said, the Black Hooks as of now are a thing of the past.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, is that the band? Am I late? Fuck I gotta get going!” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> You’d probably be more scared about what’s going to come next, but the pain in your body is making fear a secondary concern and honestly you knew as soon as you didn’t escape that it was probably all over. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because that still would have caused conflict if the boss got with her. Camid isn’t likely to be the type to just accept seeing someone else with his ex especially so soon and so close. Nope, had to kill him. Only logical play.” <EOS>
<BOS> With a bunch of undead now chasing you, it’s a very good thing that government buildings tend to have the same layouts making it at least easy for you to keep finding the next flight of stairs. This is counter balanced by more corpses of the government officials stirring whenever you reach a new floor. <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve also learned that you did a bunch of terrible shit because of it and what you did to Vera was terrible too despite what she did to you. <EOS>
<BOS> The Captain turns, forgetting Mira, his assigned “servant” is there. She stands behind him, hands clasped in front of her waist, her short “servant” dress revealing the entirety of her legs. She looks at the Captain with a pair of hazel eyes waiting for his reply, and likely his hands. <EOS>
<BOS> "Get away! Get away! Back!" You shout, but you're not really having an effect. The mermaids are easily avoiding your blind attacks and with all your wild swings you don't have the best balance. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I wasn’t going to say anything.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well this is a nice surprise.” You say taking the nearby tray. <EOS>
<BOS> Not waiting for Seth’s command, you half-run, half-walk in a crouch towards the camp. Your steps are silent, not that the Imperial soldiers would hear you over the commotion. Your blade eats into an unsuspecting soldier, sliding in and out before he can react. The body drops quickly, unmoving, as you search for your next victim. <EOS>
<BOS> "It's a breaking story that happened just last night! Some vigilante wiped out the infamous Crimson Talons!" The boy exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> The Grove of Muses is also a riot of color, but a place of sorrow as well. You can see the muses, or the husks that are left of them, standing like statues - all save Sandman, who lights the night with his glittering dust. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I suppose that’s true enough. Guess we helped each other. So where was this Caravan and where were you going?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why are we still talking, let’s just gut this old asshole and get on with it.” Camid, one of the younger members shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> A lilting symphony wakes you; brightly colored warblers and thrushes are serenading the dawn. It's your favorite time of day - the golden hour when the flora and fauna of Dreaming Forest blush and bloom, but the humans of Harrow Village have yet to wake. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you sure that’s wise? In our position, they would put us to the axe,” a nearby soldier comments. <EOS>
<BOS> The magistrate doesn’t look like the typical noble that you’ve seen many times before back in Galpatolis. He’s got more facial hair and a general less kept appearance. It’s apparent he barely gives a shit about formalities anymore since he gives his nose a quick pick and blows it out before even speaking to you. <EOS>
<BOS> You hit the ground, but you don’t stay there for long because clawed hands soon pick you up. You struggle for one of your daggers, but this is met by what you can only imagine are teeth sinking into your arm. You scream out as Scales sharp teeth not only rip your flesh, but also break bone. <EOS>
<BOS> “Suit yourself. Though if you ever change your mind and you really want to do me a favor, ask Gwen to help. She doesn’t have any knowledge of what will happen and I’m almost certain that she’d jump at the chance to fuck you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Annah…” you start to say. <EOS>
<BOS> “What rumors do you speak of? It’s me! I’ve faithfully followed you ever since the day of the massacre,” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Guh, did I get that sonofabitch?” you utter and slowly sit up. <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t be sure if that’s already alerted more of them, but you enter quickly. As soon as you do, you’ve draw attention not from the ones running the market, but from some of the potential buyers. More than a few just run for cover, others foolishly draw on you, which you return in kind. <EOS>
<BOS> “As soon as I started feeling weird I put down some of my belongings and left them elsewhere. One of particular importance too! Fuck, I can’t go get it now. Argh, I guess it’ll be safe. Probably won’t get stolen, but I sure hope somebody doesn’t destroy it in an attempt to shove it up their ass or something. Look, I just need a place to hide for a while. At least until the effects wear off.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t enter last year,” you point out. <EOS>
<BOS> No sooner have you drawn your own dagger when Klint swings at you a couple times and you barely have time to dodge. Luckily for you, despite his size Klint isn’t all that skilled in combat. While you’ve never really been in more than a few scuffles as a kid yourself, you’ve taught yourself what you THINK is adequate fighting knowledge. Also the very real threat of Klint seemingly trying to kill you is causing a survival instinct to kick in. You don’t think, you just see an opportunity causing you to swing with your dagger. <EOS>
<BOS> “…sort of. I know it’s silly, but…sometimes I do think of a life that is different than this one.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, I was hoping this might be easier if we aligned. The way you’re talking you make it sound like this Inquisitor is nigh invulnerable.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Suddenly, your vision tunnels again. The black edges focus on a single target. Mira. You’re unable to speak. It’s like an animalistic instinct taking over, compelling you to move, to act in survival. You hardly notice Seth drawing his dagger against Captain Wren’s throat. A voice inside your mind speaks, echoing, resounding within your core, fading in and out, loud and quiet. <EOS>
<BOS> “And the cost?” Prince Ragar asks. <EOS>
<BOS> "I gathered as much. I was warned to return to the caravan." <EOS>
<BOS> “Gettin’ pitch black, gonna have to stop soon.” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately for you, not fast enough as you feel several sharp objects go into your back before you even make it out the room. You fall to the floor face first and then attempt to crawl towards the better-lit corridor, but the last thing you hear is Percy whispering <EOS>
<BOS> The day finally comes and you’re trotted out before practically the whole town, most of which are already booing and calling for your blood. The town mayor is overseeing this trial and going to make the final decision. While you’ve never directly done any wrong to him, he doesn’t particularly like you so in your mind you might as well be going to the noose already. <EOS>
<BOS> But I am not content to merely remember once more. I want to make new memories, even in the short time I have left. I am old now, better your father than your husband, but I love you no less. I don't want the mages to destroy you. Even if it would save stories, or dreams, I couldn't do it. Only together does it have meaning. Come back to me, my love, and help me fix the broken world. Help me find what has been lost. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well it certainly isn’t the best.” <EOS>
<BOS> "That's not what it says on the deed, and last time I remember I wasn't married to your ass. Look Camid, you got the damn sewers. You're gaining the bum fights, you can run whores and gambling there. Shit, you can even sell Yellow Devil again or whatever else you want, but YOU don't get this place. I was the one who scratched and worked for it. You want someplace that doesn't smell like shit and covered in slime, well you're going to have to work for it too." <EOS>
<BOS> Vera’s letters to you since the invasion have always been a bit vague and come off less “close” than they did in the past and Peter’s large fleet is something you always wondered about since you know Vera could be convincing when she wanted to be. It just might have been in the wrong way. Plus even the fact that she hasn’t told you that she’s been dealing with the ECS is suspect. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I dunno, but worst case scenario, one of us picks up the pieces and takes over the city instead. Not like we’d do any worse.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Form one!” <EOS>
<BOS> The militia man's body partially hits Vaughn's and the stone floor. At this point you're just trying to get away which is difficult with one good leg. <EOS>
<BOS> Tom doesn’t say any more he just throws a punch at you. You dodge and follow up with a punch of your own. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point you’re awake enough to see everything that’s going on below. You see two men who you guess are bandits. <EOS>
<BOS> After several turns, you arrive to the library's double doors. The library is normally kept spotless, but the inside looks like a hurricane hit the room. Books, bookcases, and bodies cover the floor. In the center of it all, you see Seth. King Aeric’s emissary appears to be unfazed by the battle and fights alone, no monks by his side. His red armor looks freshly made still, and then you realize the entire robe is blood-soaked; it’s just hidden in the red color. His twin short swords work magnificently together. They glide through the air removing limb and whole heads for those who get too close. He notices you and Kassi and begins to fight his way down toward you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well…when you put it like that, I suppose how can I say no?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why the hell wasn’t she suggesting this shit when we were together, instead of bitching all the time? Things might have…ugh, fuck it.” You mutter. <EOS>
<BOS> “He’s gonna end up fucking her when he’s a teenager.” She says. <EOS>
<BOS> Keira smiles a bit at you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm? Oh you mean the girl you came here with? No, I haven’t seen her since the festivities were just getting started.” <EOS>
<BOS> You enter the inn and find that it resembles more of a mansion than any inn you’ve ever seen. No creaky wooden floors, dim lighting or drunken louts sitting at a nearby bar. You see a desk where Elana is talking with someone and a couple of mean looking men holding poleaxes standing just inside the doorway. <EOS>
<BOS> “I will do it!” you suddenly declare resolutely – “I will find and free everyone from this madman and make him pay for his crimes!” <EOS>
<BOS> While the Inquisitor is giving a monologue, you take the opportunity to end this by shooting him several times. He falls backwards crashing into a table and knocking over several other items as well. The old woman screams and begins sobbing. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fine. I can see you’re nothing like your dad. He would have at least given me the water.” Tom mutters and then mumbles some swears as you leave. <EOS>
<BOS> “I see. Where’s your girlfriend?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I’m confident that he’ll have at least enough experience to pull this off, since that’s not going to be the hard part anyway, it’s getting off the ship and out of the harbor area alive as soon as he enters it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…I suppose so.” Marco says standing before you looking completely disheveled. <EOS>
<BOS> The dominating voice you just heard is also a bit new. As a half succubus she always had a bit of a seductive tone, but this is different. Her voice just now sent a chill of fear within you. Maybe she’s not completely embracing her “succubus side” but she’s certainly embracing the demonic heritage. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I’m fucking paying attention. I’m just getting bored and you’re taking too fucking long. If I wanted that experience I’d just suck your dick.” Annah replies. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, stop fucking talking! You’re a terrible fucking leader and EVERYONE here knows it!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Five years?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Haylon! Will you shut that bitch up?! Put a gag in her mouth or shove your cock in it. I can’t hear myself think!” Flame shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> You think about your next words and the possible consequences, but then you do it anyway, because you’ve had it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good, keep the coin.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I see you weren’t joking about wanting to be called countess.” you remark. <EOS>
<BOS> “What seriously? You want to keep it?” <EOS>
<BOS> You point Marco’s own knife at his face and he’s already crying and begging for his life. <EOS>
<BOS> “Where is this shaman?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe…but I dunno…seems like ya just invitin’ trouble.” <EOS>
<BOS> Year 25 <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” <EOS>
<BOS> Soon you enter a small lab and he motions you to sit in a chair and asks you to tell him exactly about your condition and how it’s affecting you and how you acquired it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit…fuck…agh…” Gertrude utters as you step on her wrist, take away her weapon and kick her over. <EOS>
<BOS> Then you soon believe that the blood stalker has caught you because you feel multiple sharp sensations go into your chest. <EOS>
<BOS> “That would certainly solve that problem. Well let’s go, I guess.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Whatever. Have some of our people go to one of their little hangouts to set up a meeting and explain to them if they don’t accept the invitation then I’ll have my answer of how to deal with them. Now are we certain that they are the only other organization in the city?” <EOS>
<BOS> Well you sort of weren’t expecting that rant. In fact you expected Amanda to be a meek girl with esteem issues, but seems like there’s more that meets the eye. No matter, you can still work with this. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re wondering who this guy is and why he’s looking for you, you’re not exactly keen on giving away most of your hard earned money to some whore who you’re not even fucking. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey that wasn’t my idea.” You point out. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well, well, well, you have been busy haven't you?" One of them says going through your pack. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not exactly going to be taking any pleasure in it, but I’m with you all the way on this, so it’s gotta be done.” <EOS>
<BOS> You spend the next day just you by yourself in your new future headquarters as you go through the various valuable objects trying to appraise how much you should be able to get for them. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re starting to get the impression that Vera’s love for you is a little more twisted that you originally believed. You sort of wonder if it’s been borderline obsession and she’s just done a good job of keeping it together. <EOS>
<BOS> Troubles for another time however and you’ll deal with it when you have to. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t get to do it much anymore.” <EOS>
<BOS> “One thing at a time,” Kragan replies, “I suspect the villain behind this is an upstart necromancer called ‘Mad Merodatch.’ I can sense the presence of a powerful necromantic artifact in the area, and while Mad Merodatch isn’t powerful enough to rain such hell on the village by himself, he would be if he has the book.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Amusing? Why does Fel find us so amusing?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Got himself killed by being a dumb ass during a robbery. I cried over him for days, and like I said sometimes I still even think about him but my point is I got over him and moved on. And I think that’s what you’re having a hard time doing. You got some sort of weird loyalty going on with this demon chick. Reminds me of those widows that wear black forever after their husbands die. Life’s too damn short to live in the past, which is why I’m not going to fucking worry about a curse and YOU shouldn’t either. We should have gotten together a long time ago.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Very good, I take my leave Countess…and boss…” Marco says and leaves. <EOS>
<BOS> And THERE it is. Warts definitely isn’t doing this solely for altruistic reasons. <EOS>
<BOS> "No, not by accident," the slug said, "we were looking for it. The bear dropped his piece and gave it to me, and the lines reminded me of things I had seen in my travels, slow though they are. It only made sense to look over the roots of the great tree." <EOS>
<BOS> Vera immediately hugs you back, you feel her squeeze you as if her life depended on it. <EOS>
<BOS> “But if all this is true, I must have moved on because I stopped doing it.” <EOS>
<BOS> He tackles you to the floor and you roll around briefly with him, but you soon get him off of you. However, he’s managed to pilfer your pistol that was tucked in your clothing. <EOS>
<BOS> With some effort you manage to stand yourself up and hobble away. You already hear several of the militia climbing down the ladder and shouting. <EOS>
<BOS> You and Zalmora go back to your room and get into it pretty quickly. You also learn a few things, which is a fun process even if she’s a bit bossy about it. Eventually you’re entirely spent and satisfied. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera moves in to kiss you, and you slightly move away. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re a bundle of energy until the day Vera arrives. When she does its all smiles and hugs like you’re both so happy to see each other. Maybe she’s even being sincere, you don’t know yet. <EOS>
<BOS> Fortunately, the mermaids seem to have stopped harassing you and the water isn't too deep so you make it to shore. Even so, you run pretty far inland before you stop to take a better look at your surroundings. <EOS>
<BOS> “I WAS the one who took you in! I WAS the one who gave you purpose and apparently I was the one who gave you salvation! Don’t you see Tanya? I’M the one who loves you! I always did! But if I can’t have you…then I suppose I’ll have to accept that…but what I won’t accept is someone else having you instead!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ardan! Stop” you say and just barely manage to duck Ardan’s axe. <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile, corpses are making their way up the ladder. You shoot the first one in the head and then slam the hatch down and stomp on it a couple times. It’s not going to hold them for long, and you can’t stand here forever keeping all your weight on it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t worry I will when the time comes. The only reason why I’m following this fool, is because he’s got connections. When this city is in our grasp, then all bets are off, and you, ALL of you had best know what side you stand on. A true believer in the ways of Neroth or a fucking pretender. Neroth isn’t about sacrifices and decadent orgies. It’s about fucking chaos. It’s about bringing ruin to civilization. To spit in the eye of all things dedicated to order and good, even to the smallest degree. The Baron’s son is free to take over this city if he wants, but I guarantee the only thing he’s going to be ruling over is a smoldering pile of rubble. I suggest you ALL remember that.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Because she’s a demon that is incapable of it?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, Virgil. When the hell was the last time you washed? You fucking smell worse than a troll’s ass. Granted I’ve never smelled a troll’s ass, but I think it’s a safe bet you smell worse than one.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Then there’s Annah. You feel like you should be feeling a lot sadder about her, maybe even crying a bit, but maybe you got all those emotions out of your system when you killed Klint. <EOS>
<BOS> You swear if it isn’t a rebellion or faction war, it’s a fucking invasion in this city. It’s enough to make you want to pick up and just leave everything behind rather than deal with this shit. However, you’ve built something here, so you’re not doing that until all else fails. <EOS>
<BOS> Well you may have decided to travel at night, but it would seem you’re encountering more people than you thought. <EOS>
<BOS> "Of course it is! You know how this lot is, I gotta kick a little ass sometimes!" <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, not sure. At least one of them I suppose.” <EOS>
<BOS> Moving on to guys, you don’t have much success there either. It would appear nobody is interested in slumming and are perfectly content on plying their trade at the artsy locations around the campus. You question how ANY of these fuckers know anything about “life experience” if they aren’t even traveling out of their comfort zones. <EOS>
<BOS> The question remains if you’re going to stay in Holgard and fight or just run off to Jicol and run things there. It’s certainly the easier and safer solution. <EOS>
<BOS> She also notice she has little horns protruding from her head. Barely noticeable, but there none the less. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait a minute. You’ve got a moral quandary about THIS too? If I didn’t know any better I’d start thinking I had joined Joachim’s church!” <EOS>
<BOS> You just hope she doesn’t fuck things up for you when she goes poking around the magic college. <EOS>
<BOS> A Holgard watch patrol shows up, but doesn’t intervene, instead they just turn right back around, probably thinking they don’t get paid enough to deal with this level of conflict. <EOS>
<BOS> With those last words, Percy grabs you by the hair to lift your head up and slits your throat. <EOS>
<BOS> "Vaughn, are you absolutely fucking sure he can do this job?!" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I asked him if he had a mom and dad, but he just laughed and said a god has no parents. I asked him if he had any friends, and he said he just had followers in places like this temple, but said they weren’t nearly as amusing as you and mom.” <EOS>
<BOS> When the town of Mandi finally comes into view, you almost fear it is a mirage. But it is real enough, and the merchants plan a three day stay! Real supplies can be found for normal prices. 5 silver later, and you've restocked your pack with food for a week and a proper blanket. <EOS>
<BOS> "We will find a way," you clasp her hand. "We will find a way, together, for both stories and the muses to be saved." <EOS>
<BOS> “Because I’m a Crimson Talon and if you’re going to be whispering ideas into Tom’s head and I’m going to be affected by those changes, in the unlikely event he even listens of course. Besides, I might have a few ideas of my own.” <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe there is some truth to that, but in any case, this is where you part ways with your blood partner in crime. You both hug knowing that you both are going to feel like part of you is gone, but perhaps your sister is right. Perhaps it will ultimately be better for you in the long term. At least for her since she does have talent other than petty thievery. <EOS>
<BOS> Suddenly another one stands up. <EOS>
<BOS> You feel one more sharp stab into your body before footsteps run off and out your office door. By the time any of your people realize something is amiss, you’re dead. <EOS>
<BOS> “Annah, if you could just calm down a fucking second, I’m not fucking stalking you! I happen to…” you start to say before she interrupts. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re lifted up roughly from your bed by the men with spears (Who you’re assuming are Delantium soldiers at this point) <EOS>
<BOS> “I know, I know, you’re not a traveller and you hate it, but you’ll be with me. That should certainly take some of the sting out. And I know…I know in the past how I was always nagging you. I think you’ll find that I’ve changed a lot since then.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I think a lot of the members are out enjoying the riots.” <EOS>
<BOS> Great, it’s that drunken priest that has a room across from you. You thought the men of Joachim were supposed to be into purity and restraint. If you didn’t know any better, you’d think Joachim was the god of alcohol and hopeless drunks based on this guy’s behavior and actions. <EOS>
<BOS> You get inside the palace and the elegance of the interior is about what you expect. Vera is practically enamored by everything. Right now, she’s probably imagining herself as that princess you ribbed her about being. As for you, you’re a bit more of a harder sell on being impressed by such things, but if you could run your organization from a place like this instead, you certainly wouldn’t turn it down. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, the orc has a lot more endurance than you do and eventually he catches you with a glancing blow upside your head. You fall to the ground, dazed. Expecting the next hit to crush your skull, you hear the orc make a more anguished cry. <EOS>
<BOS> As the days pass Keira says with you here, she’s probably spent more time in her home than she has since her mother died since she had to be around more to take care of her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Mr. Scars wants you to take me to see Ponyride when we get to Dreadgate.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I certainly want an amicable relationship with the Syndicate and as I said, I have no intention on expanding into your territory.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Here let me try…” a girl says stepping in to explain. <EOS>
<BOS> “Obviously you aren’t, because if you did, we’d be fucking right now. My point is, I feel like I can at least converse with you about a variety of things. I mean maybe you don’t understand all my technical university speak, but I know you’re at least on my intellectual level.” <EOS>
<BOS> Surprisingly your father doesn’t say much more, he just gathers up his emergency physician’s bag and mutters to himself. You think you hear him saying how you’re a fuck up before he leaves, but that’s about it. <EOS>
<BOS> “You and that half breed bitch will pay for this! Kill them both!” Reginald shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> You end up paying a few coppers for one of their better rooms there and get some rest. The next day, you have a bit of a headache, but you try to ignore it. You’ve still got a job to do. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately, it turns out that she’s right. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well shit kid, that’s more along the lines of justice as far as I can tell. Not sure if that really makes you a cold blooded killer at all, but I guess it’s a good thing you know you can do it, if you have to right?” <EOS>
<BOS> “What? When the Baroness of Holgard calls you to court, you have to go!” <EOS>
<BOS> “More than your head is going to hurt if you don’t start answering my questions! You say you were here to visit your sister, but that smells like bullshit to me! You look like a common thief trying to take advantage of the chaos! Well that shit ain’t gonna pass now that Baron Peter Varsakken is in charge!” <EOS>
<BOS> “I got some pirate contacts who tell me shit from time to time. Honestly, I’m thinking we should just take the whole operation there, but I’m guessing you might be a little reluctant to just leave Holgard entirely.” <EOS>
<BOS> Your dick was dumb after all. <EOS>
<BOS> “Never?” <EOS>
<BOS> "And who is that?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> What you don’t understand is why the hell they’ve even been allowed to get this far. There was always the rumor that Baroness Varsakken herself was a worshipper of Fel so you would have thought she might have intervened in some direct way. But maybe it was just rumors. <EOS>
<BOS> You lose yourself in the practice until a bell rings, signaling dinner, drawing you out from the trance. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, are we going to get on with this?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I told Dr. Gossey I didn’t need an escort and could take care of myself.” Elana remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Where’s your boyfriend?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Well, I'm not a stranger to combat and I'm not going to say that I haven't done some pretty immoral things, but I'm not raping anyone." <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait! Okay, I get it, I get it. You don’t trust me, but can’t you at least give me that water?” Tom asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “What are you doing?” Elana says. <EOS>
<BOS> You might as well bring them all for this, because you’re not going in subtle. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, well seeing as we’ve already made it impossible for the Joachimites or anyone else for that matter to attack us, the war is already over as far as we’re concerned.” <EOS>
<BOS> "It's just, if I can help -" <EOS>
<BOS> “It wasn’t luck sheriff, it was justice. Look on the bright side, I won’t be here to bother you anymore…which is what I was trying to do in the first place before you dragged me back here.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Zamed points your pistol at you and fires hitting you in the chest. You fall backwards and struggle to breathe for a moment until Zamed walks over and finishes the job by putting two shots more in your head. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s my understanding that the Delantium Kingdom hasn’t exactly been in a big hurry to retake this place. I mean it’s been decades hasn’t it?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Fuck you Zal, just fuck you." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “But, I wanted to stay a bit longer though. However, if you want to leave, I guess that’s fine with me. You’re the boss after all.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit…that’s fucked up.” <EOS>
<BOS> After spending a few days in Hessla you also learn that this place really isn't as disorderly as it's reputation would imply. Granted it's far from being as repressive as Klyton, but there actually is a "force" that makes sure it isn't a free for all. The Hessla Headsmen report directly to the governor who apparently is an ex-pirate that controls everything in town. <EOS>
<BOS> Some people give you strange glances, as your garb is that of a pilgrim. You wonder if they recognize you under your hood, but no one approaches you as you walk the perimeter of the square. <EOS>
<BOS> When you left a year ago, you figured it would be a couple months maybe. You didn't know how far away all these places you're raiding were going to be. <EOS>
<BOS> “Now that’s one thing I never understood about you, why do you bother saving? You’re an excellent thief. I mean I’d never deny that. You could be living so much better than you are.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m going to be holding her at bay and hopefully sending her back because if I can’t then we’re all going to be fucked. Anyway, let’s do this.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well he lives more on the edge of da high end district. He doesn’t even own a mansion, just a modest house. He has no family an’ he also doesn’t pay for any extra guards. Not even mercs, which prolly means he’s got more coin than it appears” <EOS>
<BOS> You chuckle at the thought of saying “yes” at this point. <EOS>
<BOS> Sneaks starts laughing. <EOS>
<BOS> “Neither…I mean good of course. Look, I’m just saying you could easily blend in with the rest of the aristocratic types. You’re very pretty, like a princess and I’m not just saying that.” <EOS>
<BOS> As for you, you’ve basically been just trying to keep a low profile as you go about your ECS duties, which are currently as an enforcer at a profitable Blue Dream house in the poor district. It’s a rather lowly position for someone of your talents, but on the plus side, it’s so unimportant that Rook doesn’t even suspect you of any wrong doing and it helps that at least a few of the top Blue Dream distributors at the place have diarrhea of the mouth due to ongoing sampling of some of the drug and never shut the fuck up about sensitive ECS information. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s not sex right? I mean not really. I’ll be fine.” <EOS>
<BOS> You settle in for the night thinking about your task. You didn’t expect to get someone approaching you to perform a job, even if it is just a courier one. Still, this seems pretty low risk for decent money so you’re not complaining. <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose that’s true.” <EOS>
<BOS> Whether this is somehow the twisted divine work of Joachim or just a coincidence of a son seeking revenge on his mother's killer, it hardly matters. How he learned that it was you who did the deed doesn't matter either. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well yeah, but I’ve always trusted your judgement and you’ve stuck with this organization through some rough times, so if this Jicol is open like you’re claiming, then maybe we should check it out. I guess I’d send you with some people to get started.” <EOS>
<BOS> Not really giving a shit about them, you just push past and get in the easily accessible carriage and tell the driver to take you to the university. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hell, if it wasn’t for him payin’ for da ale, I wouldn’t even be here. So what’s in da bag?” A third says. <EOS>
<BOS> “IN THE NAME OF THE KLYTON MILITIA THIS PLACE HAS BEEN MARKED AS UNLAWFUL IN THE EYES OF THE LAW!” you hear a voice exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m guessing he won’t be looking for you anytime soon.” <EOS>
<BOS> Feeling mildly more relieved of your situation; you exit the shop with the intent of heading back home. <EOS>
<BOS> “Smart boy, now clear off!” Metzger says and pushes you aside before unlocking the door with a key. <EOS>
<BOS> “I really wish I could say I was, but you’re going to have to stay down there a little longer.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So how about you?” <EOS>
<BOS> “…what?” <EOS>
<BOS> Which you guess is good in some ways, but it’s not exactly doing this organization any favors, especially with this lot who barely plan anything out. If it wasn’t for you being so cautious, you think the militia would have apprehended most of this crew already. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ha ha! You poor silly enchanted fool! She’s half succubus you know. That’s why you’re all fucked up and not thinking straight. Why I’ll bet if it wasn’t for her charming everyone, Garrick wouldn’t have half the people in his Guild.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you arrive, she’s still not back yet, though she did say now that you’re feeling better, she might be gone a little longer. That’s awfully trusting of her to just assume some stranger isn’t going to take her stuff. You guess thieves aren’t a real problem around here since everyone knows one another and she probably believes you to be an upstanding person. <EOS>
<BOS> Actually interesting is an understatement. While you really only have Annah to compare her to, you soon learn why Randi keeps in steady business despite not necessarily being the best looking of whores. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I’m rebuilding an organization for us and you’re all invited to join and get richer than you are.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You wouldn’t have been getting me anywhere if I hadn’t saved your life a few moments ago.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad we could meet again.” Rook says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Iz dat one of those shooty things?” Warts asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “You, boy, follow me,” he says and exits the room, not waiting for your reply. The elderly advisor that was gently guided off course raises an eyebrow at you as if to say you better get going. You chase after Seth. <EOS>
<BOS> “Francine? Oh, you must not have heard. She was found dead of a Yellow Devil overdose a week ago. It’s weird because I made sure none of my girls ever took drugs, let alone that vile stuff. Tragic.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay son, the boss says you can travel with us, in fact he says you can ride with him in the carriage.” The mercenary says. <EOS>
<BOS> You run over to the rowboat, get in and deploy it. It drops a lot faster than you intended and you land hard, but there is no damage and all you get is a little wet from the splash back. <EOS>
<BOS> Several Crimson Talons see you and let you in immediately while pushing away any junkies attempting to get in. Doesn’t take you long to find Camid. He’s surprised to see you. Camid and you head to his own little area where the stench of Yellow Devil fumes isn’t burning your nostrils to talk. <EOS>
<BOS> With only moments to decide, you debate whether to take it with you, appalled at yourself for even considering it. But if the muses were gone - would the stories, dreams, and memories really return? <EOS>
<BOS> “Such power lies within your blood,” the voice behind the golden mask speaks. “You are not a worthy vessel. I am the true Unbroken!” <EOS>
<BOS> “A lot more important things than rolling around in the sewers with some thieves that’s for sure. Don’t worry; there will be someone to supervise this mission. You won’t see them, but you can be sure they’ll be there handy with a crossbow when the time comes.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I did that like maybe few times years ago after we first broke up! Fuck, I mean I didn’t…shit…how do you even know about that?” <EOS>
<BOS> As you slowly drift off with your hand covering your abused testicles, you think about how things are just fucked up with Tanya now. It’s like you’re back to square one, but maybe you were just deluding yourself anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> "Not without reason! Stories, dreams, memories - without us, they will all return." <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, but Camid and his group could have the same idea. Pretty sure Camid owns one and will probably acquire more for the rest of the Talons. Plus most of them are one shot weapons. If anyone misses, it's going to come down to a real fight and we're going to be out numbered." <EOS>
<BOS> You get to the front door and you are immediately stopped by some cloaked individuals who just suddenly appear around you. <EOS>
<BOS> This is all taking you a bit by surprise. <EOS>
<BOS> Hessla in general seems to be a bit of a bust. You figure you'll stick around for a few more days and then make your way elsewhere. <EOS>
<BOS> She drops you to the ground when you’re close enough and finally she speaks when she lands near you. <EOS>
<BOS> You never thought the day would come where you would be content on doing an honest day's work. Those roguish days of youth seem like a lifetime ago. <EOS>
<BOS> "Wait a moment," he gasps, doubling over. He grasps a tree trunk for support. His eyes roll up, but instead of white you see a starry blue. "Anger, fire, death," he murmurs, collapsing as the vision leaves him. He spends a minute catching his breath. "We have to go, now," he stands and pulls a little purple dust from a vial in his cloak. He dips a finger in it and draws a large arch in the air, chanting. A sort of gate shimmers into being in the rough place he drew it. "Come!" he warns, and jumps through it. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?! He wasn’t even on the job at the time. He was here!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait…you mean…Naji is…” <EOS>
<BOS> Seems like Warts didn’t take into account that his camouflage attempt would all be for naught due to his large honker making noise. It doesn’t take long before they kick and prod at his hidden location, waking him up. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wow, that is fucked up. Maybe I should wait until you’re passed out then.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Shouldn't take long to get it up and running." Zal remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> The whole time during Tanya’s arrival, you’ve had a stirring within you again. Namely your obsessive love for Tanya. Even this monstrous demonic form, she is still the object of everything you desire in heart and you don’t want to see her hurt no matter how well she’s able to defend herself. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe it’s due to recently discovering that you murdered several innocent women and blacked it out that’s changed things, but for whatever reason engaging in slave trade just doesn’t seem to repulse you so much anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> The Shadow Blade leader gives a small bow and leaves. <EOS>
<BOS> With some effort you manage to pull your hand free of Mr. Reynold’s grip. <EOS>
<BOS> “To celebrate, I mean you were successful right?” Annah asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “You don’t seem fine, maybe…OW SHIT!” <EOS>
<BOS> In the past I have helped the villagers to help themselves, by providing what they needed to address their challenges. It is unfortunate that in this tragedy, Mad Merodatch was able to strike without any advanced warning. I believe that was in part due to his being such a lowly necromancer – which allowed him to more easily conceal his pitiable powers from me – but also that the Oblitterum Nomeno must have been sealed away in this very area. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I have an uncle back in Harazan.” <EOS>
<BOS> You try to run down as fast as you can without tumbling again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Guys relax! He’s no threat to us and I have a good reason! Elder Flynn will want to meet this one!” Heather says. <EOS>
<BOS> As the room empties, you stand still, ignoring jabs from your passing peers. You stand stiff, unmoving, for fear of upsetting the Brother even more. When the last of your peers exits the room, Brother Trevor addresses you. <EOS>
<BOS> Samuel hesitates. He knows the wisp will relay his words and actions to the Grandmaster. “I’m searching for a tome on dark magic. Specifically, on the origins of shades. The Grandmaster is far too busy to help me look for a book.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad you brought that up, because Elias’ days are numbered. I intend on taking him out.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fine, I’ll give you what you want if only to shut you up!” <EOS>
<BOS> From this distance you get a better visual on the man in the cage. He looks about of average build, and he’s a lot older than you. In fact he looks like he might be around your dad’s age. <EOS>
<BOS> The bigger problem is it’s not exactly all that great to live at anymore. At one time you were just living here for free because the owner was dependent on you. Now, it’s pretty much acting as a front for your activities since Hank has really fallen behind in running it proper. <EOS>
<BOS> “That won’t be necessary, Mira. I prefer to do it myself,” the Captain speaks. “If you have nothing else more pressing, I could use a drink though.” <EOS>
<BOS> You look over to the emergency rowboat and you realize you could probably get to it a lot quicker by yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmm, well that style would favor road robberies a lot more. It’s still not really what I’m about though.” <EOS>
<BOS> You pull the flap of the tent. <EOS>
<BOS> “Swifty! Come here! Hey!” you shout and go to the crack, but he’s gone. You aren’t too worried since he’s run off like that before, but always comes back. He likes the Delantium cheese you give him too much to ever disappear for good. <EOS>
<BOS> You raise your head and see a man with a goatee in a red robe. A couple of other larger men in red robes stand behind him. Granted everyone around you is wearing red, but it’s obvious that this is the one you were looking for. This is Reginald. <EOS>
<BOS> Two other passengers board the carriage. A young couple who mostly ignore you since they’re really into each other. From what you can gather based on their conversation in between the kissing they’re running away together due to their parents not approving. <EOS>
<BOS> “He does a whole lot of nothing. Don’t know why Tom even sent you with us on this job, you were pretty useless.” Jake says. <EOS>
<BOS> If you can take out the opposing wizard, that would probably break the stalemate and then you all can help Heather if still necessary. You figure if you can sneak in range and get off a shot, you’ll kill the wizard and dispel the demons he keeps warping in. <EOS>
<BOS> You attempt to give Kassi a hug, but she backs away. You notice her eyes beginning to tear up, but she turns and runs before they can fall. Sounds of the battle echo into the meditation room. The soldiers have almost made their way to your position. <EOS>
<BOS> You and your sister look at each other in silence for a moment, knowing that despite your years apart, some bonds never die. <EOS>
<BOS> With a new positive attitude in mind, you set off towards Holgard. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good, you’ve learned to adapt. Remember when I first brought you here? You danced around the room like a ballroom dancer. Running only guarantees your survival for a short while,” Seth says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that is true.” <EOS>
<BOS> This is then followed by a few kicks and then two people picking you up. <EOS>
<BOS> “I…I can’t! I really can’t do this!” you say and pull your hands away, the woman’s hands however go immediately to your crotch. <EOS>
<BOS> Your mother on the other hand didn’t speak so ill of the place, which is surprising since she grew up in a lower class area than your father did. She even said that sometimes she missed the times when she worked at the inn where she met your father in the first place. Of course her knowledge about the city is bound to be a bit out of date. <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, Vera said that shortly afterwards, her mother discovered she was pregnant and claimed to the day she died that Vera’s real father was really the Baron. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re lucky you’re cute, otherwise I might not be so swayed by your charming words. However, I sense that you’re being genuine with me and I think you’re right anyway. I SHOULD follow my desires. I shall pack immediately!” <EOS>
<BOS> You try to take aim at him, but you’re stopped by two EC members who both nearly stab you. After dodging their blows, you shoot the pair of them. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course he gets a better look at you as well. <EOS>
<BOS> Madeline stands up and begins to walk over to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Somehow. Somehow I KNEW you were going to come in here one day. You look like your father around the same time we did business. How is he anyway?” he asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I imagine it probably was, but from some reason, I find tales of your youthful antics amusing.” <EOS>
<BOS> However, you’re still alive. Though in your dazed state, you realize that your “arrival” didn’t go unnoticed with several strangely dressed onlookers pointing at you. A couple of them even shout over at you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Nah, that’s okay. I’m sure whatever it was, it wasn’t that important and if it was, I’m not going to worry about it. Here you go Virgil.” You say and toss him a gold coin which he profusely thanks you for and says how Joachim’s blessing is upon you. <EOS>
<BOS> “I wish it was that simple. No, what I got is…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well maybe that needs to change.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Then you’ve just grown stupider.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, and you don’t need to worry about me. I’m not unfamiliar with the seedier elements of life.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What do you think we’ll encounter in there?” one of the men behind you speaks, though not too loudly. <EOS>
<BOS> “Come on. We’re going to both go see Keira. I know her better than anyone and I’ll know if she’s lying or not when I confront her with you there.” <EOS>
<BOS> You look and see Warts standing nearby clutching something in his hand. Looks like a bunch of small figurines of some sort. <EOS>
<BOS> “You…you’ve been watching me sleep?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “I do alright halfbreed, and what’s it to you anyway?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh come on Saldinius you can’t do better than that?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “BUST IT DOWN!” a voice shouts followed by the splintering of your door. <EOS>
<BOS> “And you would have been dead already on your own. But if you really feel like you could do better on your own then nothing is holding back from leaving. Why stay?” <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya doesn’t answer you immediately as your answer has caught her off guard a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> Gwen attempts to leave her circle but soon learns that she’s trapped within it. Attempts at casting a spell to escape or even attack Heather similarly fail. Lacking any other means of freedom, Gwen panics and begins to plead for her life. <EOS>
<BOS> You figure if you start shooting, you might attract more of their fellows or something worse. Better to do this silently, even if it means getting closer. <EOS>
<BOS> After all you’ve been through, maybe some time away from Holgard is exactly what you need right now. Plus you’re not exactly anxious to go pissing off the Ebony Claw Syndicate again after they basically left you off with a warning. <EOS>
<BOS> The backdoor out of the castle isn’t really a door. It’s more like a window. In fact, it is a window, scarcely used since it’s missing glass and is large enough that falling outside wouldn’t take much. A wrong step into the three-inch-from-the-ground window sill, and you’re plummeting down the rocky slope. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck you. I’ll have you know I’m in my forties…I think…yeah…” <EOS>
<BOS> You turn around and see him holding your repeating pistol. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I know that, but that’s not going to last forever and it isn’t that much.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Warts, I’ll admit I’m not completely familiar with the growth size of hobgoblins, but I know damn well that’s no teenager.” <EOS>
<BOS> “If you expect me to get this enchantment finished in a timely manner, you’re going to have to keep the noise down.” Grayhaze says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Interesting. It would seem that despite your girlfriend going against her nature she still managed to leave behind something that ultimately causes harm, even if it wasn’t to you directly. Anyway, fascinating tale and I believe this is your lucky day.” Flynn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “…oh yeah, I remember that. Um, I wasn’t really going to rape you, I would have just killed you. I was just trying to be threatening to get my point across.” <EOS>
<BOS> "What have we here?" Pelliandra smiled, "have these small ones found our treasure by accident?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Y’know, I think we can dispense with the check. You look like an okay lad. Off you go.” He says and finishes picking up the rest of your coins. <EOS>
