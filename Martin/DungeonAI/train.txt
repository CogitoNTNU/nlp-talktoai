<BOS> “Just wasn’t (cough) meant to be…but it’s okay. At least I know finally.” <EOS>
<BOS> You spin Vera around and as you caress her body, and then suddenly pulling her hair you whisper in her ear. <EOS>
<BOS> You munch on a bit of bread and dried fruit from your pack, every so often noticing the boy is throwing a wink or quizzical glance your way while his mother isn't looking. <EOS>
<BOS> “We’re doing this ourselves. I don’t want to rely on outside help, also we can get this plan underway a lot quicker with just us involved.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Neither is Marco apparently from what you mentioned on his attempt to be a pirate.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you finally get within the area of the carriage you see some of the supplies scattered all over the road and the body of the driver. He’s face down and not moving. You go over to check by prodding him with the blunderbuss and he’s still not moving. Looks like he probably broke his neck. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yer gang, ya idjit. Geez.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What will Ponyride do?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, this is second hand info I got from some of our people. All I know is he wants to speak with you about settling some debts.” <EOS>
<BOS> You look around the room at your advisors and trusted commanders. They’ve stood by you faithfully, helping you win countless battles against the Empire. After more than thirty years, you will finally have justice for the monastery massacre. You weigh the risk in your head, taking account for every outcome as well as judging the Empire’s strength against your own. <EOS>
<BOS> There is no cure. It’s in your very blood. The blood of the hellspawn mixed with Osborne’s ‘divine’ lineage, always at odds within, coaxing the host to draw on its power. <EOS>
<BOS> Going to be interesting when you see the look on Gloom’s face when he realizes the orb you gave him doesn’t work. <EOS>
<BOS> Hoping that nobody takes him seriously, you continue to run and then you feel a hard force hit you in the back of the head. You fall to the ground and hear screams of people nearby. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm fucking saying, if you're already bending me over and horse fucking me in this business endeavor, you could at least do it to me literally as well." Annie says. <EOS>
<BOS> "You could have done nothing, then." She shakes her head. "Sandrella has fed me on your stories, and those of others - she has kept me alive." <EOS>
<BOS> You make your way back through the sewers as quick as you can, while Warts is complaining. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually though the sky darkens and the soldiers prepare to camp for the night. <EOS>
<BOS> You make your way back to the inn where you’re supposed to be getting some rest like Tanya suggested, but after your encounter with Rook, you’re more wound up than ever. Eventually you do fall asleep and by the time you wake up, it’s night and you’re rushing to go meet Tanya. <EOS>
<BOS> “I guess I was more tired than I thought.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh fuck you. I didn’t hear you complaining a few days ago!” <EOS>
<BOS> You know you’re probably going to have to give her a little bit more this time around just to keep her appeased. At this point you haven’t really been saving much at all and you were planning on moving out of your parents home by now because that situation hasn’t gotten any better since your sister left. <EOS>
<BOS> “Does it make a difference that some of the guys are probably used for fuck holes too?” <EOS>
<BOS> Instead of being discreet or even just killing Jake and scaring the others into returning to the fold, Henry turned the Bloody Smiles camp into a graveyard. He got the job done, but killing every fucking body wasn’t what was wanted. <EOS>
<BOS> As your eyes light up, Sneaks smiles and parts ways with you. <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, you’d be doing this alone though because nobody would help you in this task. Say what you want about Garrick, but everyone listens to him and this would definitely be going against his plans. <EOS>
<BOS> "Hey! Who's the owner of this overpriced shitty establishment!?" You suddenly hear a female voice shout. <EOS>
<BOS> Your sister is quite serious about this and you know that there is going to be no deterring her from this path. This is going to change everything, but you’re willing to roll with it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes. Next to dwarves, they’re the next best civilized race that has a natural affinity to digging tunnels and building lasting underground structures and not having them collapse. In fact I read when Klyton had vast amounts of miners, the human union made such a stink to the company about employing goblins because they would work cheaper and longer hours. So there were never any proper goblin miners, at least never for long. Most of them are usually in the poorer areas of Klyton as dung sweepers and such, though I know one on campus as a janitor and I’ve spoken with him several times. We’re almost friends in a weird way. I think if I convince him, he can easily gather up more of his buddies.” Madeline remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> "I agree. The profits aren't worth the risks on that racket. A lot less sudden body meltdowns and diseased junkie whores lingering around as well." Zal remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I seriously CAN’T do this.” You say, barely stopping yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> “And THAT’S a failing on my part. If anything I’ve allowed you to get TOO close lately! I need to fucking redouble my efforts, I see that now. I should have known to keep my distance from you and I should have NEVER offered to help you on this task!” <EOS>
<BOS> “You haven’t seen him? He practically never leaves this place.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya, you…have to remember…” you utter and then Tanya shuts you up with one of her kisses. <EOS>
<BOS> The rest of the crowd, however, seems divided. Many clap and congratulate you, throwing ample silver into your hat, while others sit, as if wondering what to think about it. Despite the mixed reaction, the take is still an impressive 130 silver. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t stop to rest until you get back up top. <EOS>
<BOS> Before she can even respond back, you’re gone and already on your way. When you get to the Fancy Tickler, you immediately start throwing coin around so that the ladies can start throwing their pussy your way. <EOS>
<BOS> “Joachim’s will cannot be stopped and this city WILL learn this. I regret that I must destroy you who once saved my life. Indeed if not for you, I would not be on my holy path that I am today. For that I thank you, but you are one of the many symptoms of wickedness in this city. Perhaps if you had not attacked my flock so brutally a parley might have been possible, but then I should know that one cannot suffer a sinner. One can only cleanse them.” Yinen says raising his hands, which are emanating a white glowing light. <EOS>
<BOS> “Used to?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Knew you were untrustworthy.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately most doesn't mean all... <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, that was weird.” You say and stare at the crown a bit. You then immediately notice how much colder it is in this room. You aren’t even sure how long you’ve been actually sitting here. <EOS>
<BOS> “Necromancy and forbidden rituals. The King has outlawed dark magic of any kind,” Ragar says, drawing his sword. “I urge you to come in peace. You’ve been like an uncle to me, ever since my birth. Don’t make this harder than it already is.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It means if you wanted to, you could still get away. You would eventually in time get away from me or any feelings relating to me. Even the dreams would disappear eventually. Probably would be the best option for you because I can’t imagine it getting any better for you, if you stayed.” <EOS>
<BOS> You remove a portion of your rations from your backpack. “Here. Dinner’s on me. I’d rather pack light than risk the fall,” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> The woman holds out her forearm, obliging. <EOS>
<BOS> One of the problems with being thrifty thief/drug dealer is you’ve got more coin than you can easily carry. Granted you’ve got it hidden in what you believe is a good location, you won’t be able to easily check on it, even if you come back here to transport more of it later. <EOS>
<BOS> “Jicol? Oh wait, you actually think I was going to take you there? To Vera?” <EOS>
<BOS> Part of you wants to walk the streets of the town, one last time, and carve the sights into your mind. But a good crowd is starting to form, and even now some children are looking towards you curiously. You can hear them whisper - it seems one has recognized you. It would be the perfect moment to sit in your usual spot and share a final tale with the people you have shared so much of your life with. <EOS>
<BOS> “Besides, you just informed me that I murdered a bunch of innocent women that I had sex with and blocked it out. I’m hardly in a position to judge you.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey! Are you listening to me? We’re going this way!” Ardan shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, you at least acquired a few goodies for your troubles. You’re going to have to learn more about how to take proper care of this pistol because it’s far too valuable of a weapon to neglect. It’ll certainly make dealing with shit in Holgard a bit more manageable. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay should be plenty of time to prepare. Guess that’s it then.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you afraid if I start feeling good about myself I’ll start looking for someone better?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Funny, because I could have swore I saw you conversing with your friends which signifies to me that maybe you AREN’T the leader you claim if you have to speak with anyone before making a final decision as important as this.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Um…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, don’t worry young one, I’m sure we can work something out.” <EOS>
<BOS> You stand here, and Crash Velvet, you stand here," he arranged them one after the other in the colored squares. At first, they just grazed and ignored his instructions, but throughout the day Rom taught them the rules of the game he had made. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 31 <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, potentially fucking a sibling, I can see where that would put a damper on things…” you say barely able to contain yourself <EOS>
<BOS> "Ivani," you whisper. "I've come. After all these years, I'm here." You stroke her hair. It's as vibrant and youthful as it ever was, only highlighting the age of your own knobby hands with their swollen blue veins and spots. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t worry my friend, obviously I’m not here for treachery. Besides, I’m here by myself. Even without your magic I would never succeed so it would be a pretty poor plan indeed. I am however giving it to you. Just like I gave this to Shade when we fought the Inquisitor. Here you go.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s an item that you need to break within the vicinity of the Inquisitor. You just need to get in close enough to do it though. As long as that happens however, his defenses will go down and he’ll be vulnerable to everything. Here.” You say and hand the orb to Shade. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh just stay on this road, heed the signs and you really can’t miss it.” <EOS>
<BOS> As you and Zal are speaking about the Crimson Talon's future, Vaughn walks up to both of you. <EOS>
<BOS> Vaughn’s jaw almost drops and expresses obvious disbelief. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually Klint falls over and off to the side of you and you slide out from underneath him. While you’re still recovering, Annah is about to stab Klint again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, shit, Annah, it’s gonna be okay. My dad’s a doctor remember? He…he…he’ll fix this. I’m gonna go get him. Just…just hang on baby…” you say before you’re suddenly pulled away by two strong hands. <EOS>
<BOS> “Excuse me?” <EOS>
<BOS> You manage to roll over and see a muscular older man with a beard standing over you with a very large knife. <EOS>
<BOS> “You laugh because you know it’s true.” Sneaks says. <EOS>
<BOS> You’ll probably hit one of the many small villages under Delantium rule first, so you’ll be able to learn a little more about the Kingdom in general, as well as hone your skills and hopefully make a little profit at those. You figure by the time you get to Sivak you will have a clearer idea of what your long term plans are. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look Vera, I know you’re close with Gertrude and she’s been helpful, but I’m NOT inviting religious fanatics here, let alone having my son join them.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Too fucking easy.” <EOS>
<BOS> “In some ways I suppose it is, but then Holgard was never a beacon of justice. I mean I’m still involved in a lot of shady dealings. I just got legal permission to do it now.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I feel - I have only begun to feel. Like time was stopped, and now it flows again. But I also fade." <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m sorry, I’m sorry for everything. I…I gotta go.” You say as you leave your mother crying and go to climb out your window. <EOS>
<BOS> “Speaking with our magical allies. Seems they got more information on Peter than we do. The guy only has two wizards at his command for example and the Baroness is well aware of Peter’s plans.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera, okay. I’ll come to Jicol.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> This proposal is getting strange and giving you all sorts of mixed feelings. On one hand you’d like nothing more than to see her again, but on the other… <EOS>
<BOS> You and Warts continue a little longer and then he stops. <EOS>
<BOS> Fortunately, it doesn't come to that. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera has a bit of apprehension in the eyes, but as usual she tend to side with your decision, which is good since you don’t need to be second guessing yourself anymore than you already are in your head. <EOS>
<BOS> Your sister goes first and briefly goes into some of the places she's been. She says she actually came to Klyton when she first left home, but didn't stay long due to her not finding it very interesting. Seems as if you two just missed each other when you arrived here. When you ask how she found you in the first place she just says, as a bard she's always got her ear to the ground on various bits of information, plus it helped that you own a well known inn. <EOS>
<BOS> In the dream she’s very sad and wandering the streets of Klyton calling out and looking for you. You don’t know if that’s what she’s actually doing in real life or you’re just dreaming up the scenario, but needless to say you don’t sleep very well. <EOS>
<BOS> No sooner have you opened the door, when a hand strongly grips your hand and yanks you inside. You feel a foot trip you and you go plunging face first into the floor and hear the door being shut behind you. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, maybe you could figure out a way to make this place somewhat less...well like a sewer. You already have made a base in the best abandoned area you can find though. You suppose you could start manually expanding underground further away from the sewers themselves of course that would be a pretty extensive and expensive undertaking and it isn't like you're familiar with the details of excavation. <EOS>
<BOS> You now see that your fight with Klint has drawn out a lot of the townsfolk. Bastards were probably watching the entire time. The man who tried to pull you away was the Wilfred the pub owner. It’s a good thing he’s not one of the appointed town watch, but it probably won’t be long. <EOS>
<BOS> “No…I…agh! Look it’s getting dark enough that I can barely see shit in front of me and we probably should just stop for the rest of the night. I’ll see if there’s a suitable tree to sleep in…” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s not a bad plan, though you’re really not sure on the whole “allying” with Reginald bit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well this is a nice side to see of you. Still, you sure? I mean I’m sure Gertrude can look after him if you find that you’ve got more to do than you planned.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> You can imagine that your parents wouldn’t exactly be thrilled about your new position even if you did officially “go legit. While it would be easy to just forget about them, as you haven’t seen them in nearly two decades now, you can’t just dismiss them completely. After all, despite everything your mother probably still loves you and your father…well he DID bail you out of trouble for years. <EOS>
<BOS> “St…op…” Vera says and begins to struggle. <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re pondering potential criminal activity, you spot a group of five rough looking men walking down the corridor. They don’t look the sort who would stay here. <EOS>
<BOS> Spryce leads you below, down dimly lit steps into a foul smelling room. "This'll be your berth," he explains, pointing to a shredded cot. It could be worse - curved planks jut out from the wall at intervals above it, with flat pillows and ratted blankets on each. As your eyes adjust, you see that there are ten 'beds' in all in the small room, a few of which are already occupied. "Get some sleep, you'll need it," he suggests cryptically. "We'll be casting off in a few minutes." <EOS>
<BOS> The capital is built in a circular manner. The main keep lies in the center, surrounded by varying sections of the city. Besides the city walls, the residential and merchant portions of the city aren’t defendable. The keep is where the true defense lies. Tightly packed buildings, built more vertical than horizontal, fill the city. As the city grew, it looks like the only option was to build up rather than out. There’s only so much space within the city walls, even for a city as massive as the capital. <EOS>
<BOS> “Didn’t you just say Jasmine sells cheap quality shit?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Is there some sort of place that sells them or something in Hessla?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I know what you’re asking, Lorthander. I’ve been fighting the Empire my entire life. If I could simply stride into the Emperor’s throne room and slay him, I would.” <EOS>
<BOS> You pound again. <EOS>
<BOS> “What makes you so sure?” <EOS>
<BOS> Also, while Klyton has no jurisdiction over Teckleville, it has been known to apprehend wanted criminals from elsewhere trying to hide out there. Not to mention the place in general has a fairly good reputation (And they want to keep it that way) as far as its own security goes. <EOS>
<BOS> You exit the partially destroyed building and still see that Heather is fighting her opponent on the roof of the intact building. She needs help fast and you begin shouting at the students when you get closer to them. <EOS>
<BOS> You walk over to the Inquisitor’s body to make sure he’s dead and see that he is indeed still alive, but he won’t be for long. In between his gasping and wheezing he tries to speak. <EOS>
<BOS> “What, seriously?” <EOS>
<BOS> The next day you meet with her in your office again and she seems surprised that you’re entertaining her idea. <EOS>
<BOS> “No! Let her finish him off! His impotent fighting will only prolong the inevitable and make her transformation all the more sweeter as she will tear him apart with no mercy!” he shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 33 <EOS>
<BOS> You pull out the two large pieces of the egg and then hold them out. <EOS>
<BOS> Even if you could make the choice, for yourself, to trade the permanence of stories to keep what is left of Ivani, you can't decide that for all of Sandrella. Ivani's husk is merely the shadowed remnant of the caring Muse of heroes. <EOS>
<BOS> “You…you are not going to last that long.” She says and then leaves. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright, alright, fine, Gert. Does anyone else know?” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> You laugh too as the pair of you go seek a room for the night. <EOS>
<BOS> “He’s studying from that book you got him in my office and Layla is watching him.” <EOS>
<BOS> Dusk’s face turns to one of embarrassment. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s of minor importance. However, you may be right about her not turning you in, she always was a little too sweet on you. Talking about you even after we…y’know what? Fuck this, I can just bring in your head…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Me? I did nothing other than speak a few truths to her guided by Neroth’s wisdom, though as I said, his presence in this house is stronger than most. I believe she felt it, just as all who follow do. However, she’s still not complete, that’s where you will come in. She will complete her transformation with you as the sacrifice and we will ALL witness it, and it shall be glorious to see a higher being achieve freedom!” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s so good in fact that you actually feel genuinely drained and get sleepy soon after you climax. <EOS>
<BOS> "Wait!" he cries, and you see he is detained as well. "You are all in danger! We have but minutes - " he doubles over again. <EOS>
<BOS> The Nocturnal League isn’t out of the fight, but many of the members are seriously starting to question your leadership since nobody is making as much coin with religious fanaticism taking root and your businesses no longer being the draw they used to. A couple foolishly attempt to challenge you (which results in their death) but more of them are just thinking about leaving the city for better pickings. Warts ends up being one of those since he just disappears one day and doesn’t return. It’s possible he’s dead, but you remember he did this before during the last major Holgard conflict. Vera’s pissed and you are too to a small degree, but you aren’t excessively surprised. <EOS>
<BOS> The night of the attack comes and you meet with Gloom just a few blocks away from the Dornan Temple, you have your usual hob retinue with you. (You’re really getting used to having these guys around nowadays) Gloom is with a few of his own people, but even without magic powers you can sense some are probably nearby in the shadows. <EOS>
<BOS> You see a bridge in the distance and head towards it. You feel something hit your back, or rather your backpack. Fortunate that you were wearing it to block the arrow. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora comes back to you and helps you up. It’s actually amazing that you’re able to stand though you’re having a hard time with the balance. Your vision is blurry and your face looks like its been through a meat grinder. <EOS>
<BOS> “No! I want to go to Klyton! I’ve never been there!” Annah demands. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, sometimes you wonder about your family. How your mother and father are doing and if their lives in Teckleville are better, worse or the same after events that occurred so long ago. <EOS>
<BOS> (You also never realized how very against slavery you are no matter what form or who it is. You suppose love of freedom is something) <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah I’ve seen shadow magic as well by EC members and the actual priests, but honestly, I’m more concerned with more corporal trouble than divine right now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…I’m…fine…” Heather remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well shit happens. Look, I can’t explain that since I wasn’t there. All I can tell you is you don’t have any curses on you. As for the girls, well it sounds like you weren’t exactly going with the most morally upstanding ones and violent death is usually a common one amongst the lower class and lesser born. I’d chalk it up to bad coincidence.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well now that I’ve filled you in on some of my journeys, it’s time for you to do likewise! Give me all the details because I trust that this will definitely be a very interesting story!” your sister says. <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, you’ve asked around and done as much research as you can on the matter and there is one place in the Empire which has slightly more relaxed rules on magic and that’s the town of Arcanius. Though it’s not so much of a town as it is a giant magic testing area. There is where all the less disciplined, unwanted bastard children of nobles who have minor abilities or just downright anti-social wizards go to practice their skills without as much supervision though apparently there is still a powerful warden that oversees everything. <EOS>
<BOS> “Perhaps the Empire is looking for other ways into the castle, rather than the main gate,” Richard says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Lloyd. Calm yourself and sit the fuck down before you have a heart attack. Have drink or something while you’re at it.” Rook says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, so what about this other guy. The real assassin?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Go…just go…” you utter as she gives you a frustrated look mixed with sadness before running off. <EOS>
<BOS> "And if it can't be done?" <EOS>
<BOS> As strange as this arrangement is, you have a positive feeling about it, though you’re still going to remain cautiously optimistic until you actually see some work from her. <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sniff) No. No…I’ll continue the work. I promised to see this through. I…won’t say anything to Camid either (sniff) I’ll just get over it, like you (sob) said…” Madeline says before crying again. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s a long walk too, but fortunately the route from Holgard is no longer impeded as much by a lot of woods and roads are much more prominent now. With any luck, you’ll run into a Klyton carriage on its way to Holgard and you can tell them the news and get a ride back. <EOS>
<BOS> "I guess shortly after we both left. I think he's about twenty or around that age. He's okay, a bit on the straight laced side. Guess mom and dad finally got the well behaved child they always wanted." <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, nobody. We haven’t really gotten around to figuring it out yet…but hey your name came up as a potential candidate! I don’t think anyone else wants the job.” <EOS>
<BOS> Vera steps back from you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Rook, I don’t understand why you’re listening to this man. He was KILLING us for years before he joined and he hasn’t stopped! He just walked in here with the heads of two of our best people and is accusing me of ripping off the Syndicate! I’ve dedicated my LIFE to this organization and you should know that because you’ve known me for a lot longer than you’ve known this fucking liar!” Lloyd says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, so you were successful? You killed them both?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “True. I guess you would know. Anyway, I’m Zalmora.” <EOS>
<BOS> You feel the ground shake with Brother Trevor’s footsteps as he stomps towards you. Just before he arrives, you speak. <EOS>
<BOS> And yet a stare of defiance still exists in his eye as he’s being hauled out to you. <EOS>
<BOS> You sit down and the man briefly smiles. <EOS>
<BOS> “Just say a prayer ta Yag, you’ll be fine.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, why did you do that?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? So you wanna fuck me? I mean we can do that too…um you don’t want to do it the other way do you? I mean…if I gotta take it in the ass, (sigh) I will, but you can’t expect me to fake enjoying that.” <EOS>
<BOS> "What? You're going to kill me? Pfft. I'm already dying with how my health is going and my three kids are fucking disappoinments. As I said I have nothing to lose and my soul is prepared for Joachim's eternal glory. You won't get away with it anyway, Joachim always finds a way to punish the wicked." <EOS>
<BOS> “Let it fucking go!” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> It still takes a few hours, but you soon reach the end, arriving around noon in a sort of bunk-room. The stone, unfortunately, doesn't work outside the passage, so you leave it behind on one of the shelves. <EOS>
<BOS> You take steps in coming up with potential plans and ideas of how to organize all this for the remaining week. While you hope Warts has managed to convince a lot of people to come to this gathering, you’re confident that even if that isn’t the case, in time many will eventually flock to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t believe that, I believe its MORE likely you’re just sticking around because you’re an infatuated idiot.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I was… I was visiting my sister.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I figured those orcs weren’t just wrecking my businesses on accident.” <EOS>
<BOS> After skulking about in the sewers for an unfortunate length of time, you finally manage to sneak out and away from the city entirely. You think about going to your private stash you have buried, but decide if you really need monetary incentive to convince anyone to still follow you, then it probably won’t be worth it or you can do it as a last resort. <EOS>
<BOS> You fly backwards and eventually slam into something made of harder stuff than you are and you go unconscious. <EOS>
<BOS> Given the extensive amount of tunnels, you’re actually surprised he didn’t end up flooding Jicol with a misplaced dig like the Watchman captain was talking about. <EOS>
<BOS> While talking might work under normal circumstances, you’re literally having a hard enough time trying to focus on your own sense of self-preservation because part of you wants to just embrace her and go out fucking if your semi-erection is any indication. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. Right. Don’t let me keep you. Just remember, Scales has never been a friendly sort and probably the best way to handle him is to defer to him as the alpha. If he thinks you’re a threat, he’s going to react accordingly. Then again, if he thinks you’re too weak, he might just eat you, but I’m guessing not acting aggressively might help. Anyway, if you even think you’re in grave danger, just get the hell out of there. Be careful okay?” Zal says and starts to leave, but before she does she kisses you goodbye. <EOS>
<BOS> You continue to try to ignore it, but then your mind starts going to a darker place. You begin to see the images of the women you had sex with in the past after Tanya and their deaths. Honestly before recently when you started explaining all this Vera you hadn’t given them much thought. You never actually saw them die when you were informed of their deaths, yet now you’re seeing their deaths quite clearly, like you were actually there. <EOS>
<BOS> What the hell, it might make for an interesting change of pace. <EOS>
<BOS> “Is the other part money?” <EOS>
<BOS> “You seriously expect me to just hand him over?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “So is that going to happen to me?” <EOS>
<BOS> But it's only 10 silver to take the two-hour ferry ride between the continents of Redsand and Aselthorne, and you are too impatient to delay any longer than you have to. <EOS>
<BOS> And with that, you and Tom are on your way to see his Crimson Talon cohorts… <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya nods at your pragmatism on the situation and tells you that you should go report to Rook and get the ball rolling on the first phase of this plan. <EOS>
<BOS> Shade himself is unfortunate enough to not react in time before being caught in this light. He is set aflame, however fortunately for you he has enough in him to take out the null orb and throw it to ground. It shatters and suddenly the white light surrounding the Inquisitor disappears and so do the beams of white light coming from the sky. <EOS>
<BOS> A dewdrop glints from the corner of her eye. She blinks, her eyes coming back from grey to that deep and celestial green. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 21 <EOS>
<BOS> “The rumor is at least by next year.” <EOS>
<BOS> “At the risk that you’ll take me with you, are you sure you should go attempt to do this alone?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not sure if staying neutral was the best decision. We probably should have directly helped the Felians. They were our allies after all and now we don’t have any.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t believe that worked. You don’t know what the hell Heather did to him, but he actually believed he only asked you for a thousand gold monthly payment as opposed to the much larger sum he asked before. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, and I don’t think that it’s a good idea to just let disobedience within the organization to go unpunished like that. Besides, I also thought that given this Scale’s reputation, maybe we could get him to join again.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Zal, you shouldn’t have to go do this if you don’t want to. Why don’t I go instead or we can go together?” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’ve been living here for years now and you have never said two fucking words to me before. Now all of a sudden you’re speaking to me? What the hell do you want?” <EOS>
<BOS> Elder Flynn stares at you a bit, strokes his beard and then finally answers you. <EOS>
<BOS> “I AM the leader and I’m not following some asshole that’s trying to scare me. I know some shit about you. You only just got here and only have a handful of people. The Black Hooks have WAY more than you. You don’t look so tough and if you didn’t have that pistol, I’d kick your ass.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, but I REALLY think I can convince you that my idea is a good one.” <EOS>
<BOS> You talk to the mayor for a little while longer about how you’ve come to understand the struggles of running a town of sorts and how even though taking control of this place, you are not looking forward to the operations of it. <EOS>
<BOS> The woman shakes her head. <EOS>
<BOS> Doesn’t take long for you to get there and soon you’re at your dad’s old place of higher learning. You never thought you’d ever be here. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’ll have to excuse the mess and disrepair of this place. Used to be my parents until they died.” Yinen says. <EOS>
<BOS> Even the two priests are a bit alarmed by their unintended actions, but they just dispose of your body away from the temple and in a nearby alleyway where it will most likely be assumed that you were killed by the various acts of violence currently going on in the city, assuming stray dogs or rats don’t eat it first. <EOS>
<BOS> He motions the others to pick you up which they do despite you struggling and the agony of a broken leg. <EOS>
<BOS> Also doesn’t take much to upset them either… <EOS>
<BOS> “What’s the point? You’ve made it quite clear you’re not interested and others have also made it quite clear as well, so why bother beating my head up against a wall?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmm…go on.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, after tonight, you won’t need to worry about watching them ever again.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well wait a minute. What about fighting slaves? Y’know slaves that fight each other and people bet on who wins.” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s more along the lines of people who lost everything in the disaster are preying upon each other and other citizens in general. Between trying to still keep a strong naval force to ward off pirates and cleaning up after the disaster, Jicol’s order attempts have been lack luster. So much for their plans of having a “clean city.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya can you at least tell me something? I mean did Reginald case a spell or what? I mean was all his babbling true, Neroth is your father in some way?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Got it.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Probably, but fortunately your love sick idiocy has worked in your favor, so do you think she'd help?" <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno…hope not. Maybe my dad got to her in time. I had to sort of leave town in a hurry though.” <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re making your way back down the stairs, Warts suddenly is running up them. <EOS>
<BOS> “Brother Trevor said I need to scrub every inch of the kitchen to atone,” she answers. <EOS>
<BOS> “That is why we must strike!” Seth pleads. “You can only remain defensive for so long. Eventually, and it will happen, the castle will be overrun. I’m not going to sit here and waste away. I’m gathering a small attack force. I hope you’ll join us, kid. Meet me back here at midnight if you’re in.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I see you made it, kid,” he speaks in not more than a whisper, eyes still closed. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, blocking your hearing is only part of the solution. Now you're in a rowboat which is a lot lower to the water. You see a green hand reach out from the water and grab the side of the boat... <EOS>
<BOS> “Well since it’s an incredibly bad idea to summon demons or raise corpses for protection, it can’t hurt for you to provide a little extra protection. Where is the rest of your crew anyway?” Heather asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay Rook.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You should, he was one of the Ebony Claw’s lieutenants. Explains why he had access to shadow magic.” <EOS>
<BOS> Year 23 <EOS>
<BOS> “What are you doing?” You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well,” the wizard continues, “I surmise it has to do with the legend of ‘Serpent Fang’ – the ancient dragon slain long ago. If Mad Merodatch does have the Oblitterum Nomeno, then he is going to have a hard time keeping it from other more powerful necromancers, once they realize he has it and come looking for him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I think it’s time you took your clothes off, you probably got some wounds that need patching up and I can get to them better if you’re naked.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, but it soon will be. Like you said, Peter will probably realize he can’t hold this place.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Was David your friend?” <EOS>
<BOS> "It's understandable." The mage nods to himself, "many of the common people adore the muses. The don't even care if it's true or not. 'Give them the stories!' they say - the muses sacrificed themselves for the planet, after all. The mages suffered heavy losses, as well, but the people don't see or care about that. Mages weren't wiped out. I hear there is tension brewing in Stone City over it all. The people don't like the plan to starve the muses." <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s true, but doesn’t that sort of mean you’re sort of responsible of what’s going on with Jake? Pretty sure that’s what Tom will point out as well.” Vaughn says. <EOS>
<BOS> Whatever the near future holds, you’ll have to deal with it when it happens. Right now you have to make a decision on where you’re going to go because you’re not exactly hot on the idea of staying out here in the wilderness. <EOS>
<BOS> She mentions that her mother was once very briefly employed as a maid during the Baron’s reign of the city. She goes on to say that her mother always told her that she once had a brief fling with him while she was cleaning one of the guest bedrooms. Unfortunately the Baron being the asshole he typically was, he had all the maids, including Vera’s mother, replaced a week later because he claimed his palace wasn’t getting clean enough. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well…okay I suppose if this is something you want to do, I’ll have to support it. You’re probably right about sticking around here anyway, I know I get pretty bored in between waiting for the next mark. I assume you’re probably already getting ready to leave soon. Just let me get my things together and I’ll be ready…” <EOS>
<BOS> You look over to your left and see Scully jump over the side of the ship. This is soon followed by the Captain coming out of his quarters. <EOS>
<BOS> The road itself is empty for most of the time, though you do pass a couple merchant caravans heading in the opposite direction. You just think how if you were still in Teckleville, you probably would have been stealing from them. <EOS>
<BOS> You explain the situation to Vera who is probably more concerned about Kol than any war with the Syndicate. She even asks you where Kol is and how he’s doing. After giving your answer about that, she gets a little pissed that you haven’t made the arrangements to get a ring enchanted for him and goes off to see Kol immediately. <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, I never really thought of myself as a leader since it seems like a lot of headache, but I suppose out of all of us that are left, I do have the most experience and years on my side. I suppose given that my face is more well known now due to being thrown in a cage by the city watch, being the boss has appeal since I won’t have to risk going out in public as much. I guarantee if I get nicked again, it’ll probably be the death penalty. Well anyway what’re your plans? You still interested in joining or is that a silly question?” <EOS>
<BOS> It occurs to you that snitching them out to the militia is most likely the same thing as wiping them out. The Klyton militia isn't exactly known for showing restraint when it comes to things like this. And as Vaughn said, Camid will most likely be foolish enough to go down fighting and take everyone under his command with him. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually your day arrives and predictably your case is pretty cut and dry. You’re found guilty of stealing one of the emperor’s royal crowns (You guess he has several) and the sentence is death. You have to wonder why it took so damn long to sentence you seeing as they found it on you. You can only guess this place has a really backed up legal system on top of it being “civilized.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, if it isn’t the head of the Nocturnal League. Glad you could make it, I was hoping you would.” <EOS>
<BOS> “The Joachimites are starting to break this stalemate and win this religious war you know. The Yagites are gone and so are the followers of Karn. The Dornans are still around, but they’ve decided to just put up a force field around their temple and ride it all out. That just leaves the Temple of Fel and rumors are that they expended a lot of their power taking down the Karnites.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> Then again with the curse you have, that isn’t likely to ever be a problem. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, has something come up?” Tom asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’ll not harm the boy, shade,” Brother Samuel speaks. He activates the divine magic seals on his cane for emphasis. The wood begins to emit holy light infusing its strength through Brother Samuel’s body. <EOS>
<BOS> As this is all happening you just stare the stage where some old guy is talking at a podium. struggling to keep your eyes open. <EOS>
<BOS> Time passes and it feels like you’ve been walking through this forest longer than expected. <EOS>
<BOS> Now? She’s at least a foot taller than you and her wings along with her horns even bigger and more impressive. She has hooves rather than proper feet. Her body looks more muscular and athletic looking rather than traditionally curvy and sexy. In fact she’s not even naked, she’s wearing some sort of form fitting armor and a wicked looking sword hangs by her side. <EOS>
<BOS> “Truly? Are you going into a new line of work then?” <EOS>
<BOS> Though to be honest when you first went to talk to her, your mind was mostly made up anyway, because despite her obvious mental problems, you really can’t resist a pretty girl who is willing to do all that for you. It’s a huge ego boost for one thing. <EOS>
<BOS> To the west of the square is the main residential section. Wooden homes stand in an ordered grid for a farspan until the houses give way to shacks and cabins rambling back to the treeline. To the east is the blacksmith, bakery, Inn, hospital, stables, and some other larger buildings and permanent shops. To the south is the logging camp, the council chambers, and a very nice lake bordered by Dreaming Forest - Lake Firayah, where you proposed to Ivani. <EOS>
<BOS> “This is the girl I mentioned. Madeline.” Camid says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shut the fuck up already and stop being a bitch! Shit!” you yell. <EOS>
<BOS> “What are you suggesting then?” <EOS>
<BOS> “You interrupted my practice,” you comment. <EOS>
<BOS> Never thought he’d be a loose end you’d have to tie up, but life is always full of surprises. In any case, the JCR is finally finished and with Jicol still trying to rebuild, you’re in a stronger position than ever. <EOS>
<BOS> Despite now losing your sword and being in the water, you still refuse to give up, you continue to keep your eyes closed and struggle against the mermaids pulling you down. It is at this point you begin to hear their laughing in your head. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah’s got the looks and flirting down, but that’s about it. Your sister actually had the talent to get the attention of people even if they weren’t some weak willed slob that went nuts over the latest sweet young thing that batted their eyes at them. She could lure them with a tale or a song and keep a whole entourage captivated if need be. <EOS>
<BOS> “So you wouldn’t be coming to Jicol?” <EOS>
<BOS> “The Duchess sure had a velvet throat.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Then Reginald can stop buttfucking the baron’s son for one second and start doing his own dirty work. I know he likes to think he’s some sort of high priest of Neroth and all, but he’s a fucking dabbling ponce. Him and his noble boyfriend have no real idea of how this shit works.” Another one says. <EOS>
<BOS> You've got a good thing going on and nobody fucks with you down here. If worst comes to worst, you're confident that you could easily lose the militia if they actually ever made an effort to patrol down here. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well at this point I’m starting to think if Lloyd had just cut me in on that deal as well he might still be alive, because I’m seriously starting to wonder why I’m bothering anymore. It’s obvious that I am not getting the support I need and it’s almost like Holgard is an afterthought for them. I mean if they don’t even want a fucking chapter here then fine with me, I got other interests.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Nah, if we’re going to march across the open fields, we might as well just walk on the road since we’ll be just as exposed either way. The road will be easier to traverse as well since that grass looks like it gets knee high.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah. Tom’s no leader. He’s just leader because nobody else wants the hassle. Well except maybe Jake, but nobody really wants to follow him either.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve got an erection right now that you could stab someone to death with and you are about ready to murder the closest woman available and worse, they’re just about ALL available. <EOS>
<BOS> “So which do you think is more necessary? Your protection or my strength?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait a minute. I’m just supposed to be here for protection. I didn’t hear anything about being your porter. Besides, doesn’t a place like this usually have someone to do that?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Our current strengths are basically smashing people in their face and taking their shit. I thought we established that isn’t exactly good in the long term.” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not exactly, but…look she’s got some demon blood in her. I mean surely you realized that she wasn’t quite human right?” <EOS>
<BOS> Gwen’s attitude is a lot different than you last remember. <EOS>
<BOS> “I feel like this is a trick.” <EOS>
<BOS> While Klint is holding knife, you still doubt he’s serious about killing you with it. He’s a lot of talk and trying to scare you, time to call his bluff by kicking his ass. <EOS>
<BOS> You tread water for a while in your attempt to get to shore despite the strong current. Eventually you manage to grab on to a fallen tree trunk and drag yourself to shore. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wow, those are some impressive names for ships. Bet you lot gave hell to the Jicol navy.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Um, thanks?" You say a bit confused. <EOS>
<BOS> “I can’t even be bothered to go through this shit right now.” Rook says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well who else would it be? Yag fucking around with his magic dice? I mean I have a hard time believing its coincidence; there were too many women that died! I mean maybe you didn’t mean to place it on me, maybe it was some sort of after effect of your power of something.” <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe you'd get more out of these raids if you were of the rapey nature, but curse your parents for raising you to at least adhere to some sort of moral standard. Though some of them seem content on buggering each other. (And no matter how long you've been at sea, you can honestly say there's nothing that would even make you THINK about sticking it to any of this loathsome lot you're with!) <EOS>
<BOS> You chuckle at that brief history of yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> "Excuse me," the slug said, "but is this yours?" He held out the piece, but the bear didn't reply. <EOS>
<BOS> As you leave city hall, Zalmora speaks up. <EOS>
<BOS> “I told you I sent them away. They isn’t going to be some big fight. There isn’t going to be a fight at all. This is the end. I wish you could have loved me, the way I love you, but at least we’ll die together, and I guess that’s enough.” <EOS>
<BOS> “And I believe you, but I don’t feel comfortable putting one of my employees at risk like that. He could very well die.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Okay mister, but you better hurry up, these are selling fast!" <EOS>
<BOS> You see the bloody heads of the various people that have gone missing. Carl, Annie, Vaughn, Zalmora, Camid and others under your command. <EOS>
<BOS> “While I’m sure you’ll be very proud of your son becoming a man and all that other macho shit, I don’t think you’re think of the possible ramifications. I mean crushes can turn into love. We can’t have him falling in love with a slave girl.” <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Marco attempts to punch you in the balls with his other hand, but instead you stomp him in the face. You then proceed to break his arm, he screams in pain and his girlfriend looks away while his buddies look like they’ve just realized how serious this is. <EOS>
<BOS> "Cap'n Brost," he calls to a man even larger than himself, arrayed in a mismatched outfit that is alternatively baggy and constricting, as if each of the pieces was stolen from a person of different size. "We got another one wanting free passage." <EOS>
<BOS> “Brother Trevor always had it out for me. A lot of extra time in the practice room, I guess. You know I’m related to the Grandmaster, right?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shades! Don’t insult me, monk. I have no love for petty sorcerers, but even less for devotees of the light.” <EOS>
<BOS> You leave the dorm with haste as well as the campus. Then its trip back to “home sweet home.” You save your coin and walk back tonight, part of that walk involves thinking about Annah. You sort of figured you’d bump into her again, maybe on some level you might have even wanted to, but you didn’t expect it to be like that. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, some humie gal just ran through here an into da sewers wearin’ practically nuthin’.” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Do you even need to ask?! Your incompetent bumbling nearly got not just yourself killed, but ME as well! What the fuck were you even doing there? Did you KNOW I was going to be there?” Tanya asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “And you greatly underestimate our generosity and intelligence if you believe we’d just let you walk away.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I thought you might feel that way, so how about this then…Peter Varsakken is meeting Zamed. We could go to this meeting as well and we could hash out our demands.” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Last time you looked, there was a hell of a lot of orcs. Granted you have some of the Empire’s soldiers with you and hopefully a few of the bastard passengers in the other carriages are above average with their lack of formal magic training, but it’s not going to be an easy fight. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that sounds like a threat.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I appreciate your patience Tanya, and it’s certainly better than the alternative.” <EOS>
<BOS> You fully expect Warts to shout obscenities about you leaving him behind, but you don’t. Since you haven’t looked back, you actually think the blood stalker caught him, but you don’t hear any screams. <EOS>
<BOS> "It is. I have only been there once, on my wedding day." You sigh, recalling for a moment Ivani's bronze skin and sparkling red dress framed against a hundred different greens. It had been a secret event, only attended by a few of the Muses themselves and select guests. But you couldn't tell a story of that day, without risking it fading as well. That was a funny thing about history. Even things that don't start as fiction grow colored by time, and memories become tales of their own. "I will set our tale there," you finally speak again. "And perhaps -" you glance above his bed, where a small tin soldier stands at attention atop a crude shelf, "-perhaps a young soldier for our hero. But I still need an object. Something special to play a crucial role. Do you have any suggestions?" <EOS>
<BOS> Heather’s a little surprised to hear you say that, though you just sort of came up with it in the moment. <EOS>
<BOS> Perhaps they would respond well to a break in routine, instead? Rom invented spinning hooks and harnesses, that would allow the horses to walk backwards around their posts even when he could not be there to guide them. But backwards was not where they wanted to go, and so all Rom earned for this effort was some exhausted, angry snorting, and more than a few nips and bruises. <EOS>
<BOS> The next day, you gather up Kol and prepare to head to Jicol. You ask if Vera wants to come, but she says she has a bunch of slaves she needs to sell and besides all that she says if something goes wrong and you are both killed, she’ll still be around to take revenge. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re tired, dirty, hungry, thirsty and just all around miserable. Eventually you decide to just give up and try to make your way back. You THINK you might know how to get back to the main road and from there you’re going to go back to dig up your stash and make your way elsewhere entirely because this has been a complete disaster. You’re starting to wonder if you should have just tried to convince Vera to join you. <EOS>
<BOS> “If you’re going to get rid of your curse, you best do it now while she’s trapped. While she’s in that circle you can command her to release you and she has no choice but to do so. So get on with it!” Heather exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm sorry," you whisper to her mottled husk, "it doesn't look like there is a way to save both you and the stories of the world. I want you back again, I've missed you - half my life I have wasted away, without you in it. But even if I could bring you back, could I do it at such a price? Would you accept it? You never looked down on me for my humanity. You loved the people of this world, and you loved stories. I carry your book with me, even now - your tales are my most treasured possession. I know what you want of me." You lean forward, pressing your forhead to her stone-like arm. "I just - I just don't want to do it." <EOS>
<BOS> You actually don’t have many problems on the way there, but you do come across a few unexpected faces. It’s some of the Nocturnal League. They look like they’ve already been in a few scrapes. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, irony is always funny.” Shade says. <EOS>
<BOS> And then you do it again immediately after. <EOS>
<BOS> Afterwards, Madeline then suddenly becomes “gentle” and for a brief moment lies on top of your body. <EOS>
<BOS> “Uh, I kind of have a special request. I know it’s short notice, but…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why? Because I don’t look like one? Because I’m young?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well you look good anyway, not sure about your clothing though, a little too colorful for my tastes, but then you always were the flashy one." <EOS>
<BOS> “The other Felians?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why would he need back up Vaughn? I’m sure he can fuck her perfectly well all by himself.” Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh? Oh yeah, sure!” you say and immediately move on to more important matters. <EOS>
<BOS> If you’re reading this then I’ve already left the city and you’re awake. I wasn’t sure if I drugged the drink too much, but I took a chance. I’m just glad you decided to drink at all. I wasn’t confident I’d necessarily be able to knock you out by hitting you in the head. <EOS>
<BOS> “Driver! Speed up! I’d like to get Hessla sometime this month! And YOU up there, I hope you’re doing your job and keeping a look out!” <EOS>
<BOS> You feel like you should be angrier about this and you are pissed to some extent. Maybe even a little hurt, but small part of you can’t help but admire the fact that Annah pulled your strings so flawlessly. She must have been seething for years and still managed to keep it from you since you really thought she was over it. Some damn fine restraint on her part. <EOS>
<BOS> "You're the doctor I've seen these few weeks." <EOS>
<BOS> “You, miss, in the gray.” You tip your staff towards her. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, but we could at least get somebody from the Guild or even one of the associates to look in on this. I mean he’s one of our best fences. Seems like for all the Guild’s talk of solidarity, they’re dropping the ball on this one.” <EOS>
<BOS> Not exactly ideal circumstances but if this is what it’s going to take to break the curse along with gaining help from the Dornans then this is what you need to do. Part of you still feels bad about betraying Tanya like this and you’re not looking forward to when you “meet” her again. Still, Flynn is probably correct in that she is most likely not the same girl anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the hell indeed, you’re the one locking the door and acting all suspicious.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> Now it’s everyone for themselves as you’re stomping through the sewers trying to evade the Holgard Watch who apparently took a step back from keeping the religious factions from destroying small parts of the city, to focus on the assholes who were severely disrupting trade in the city. <EOS>
<BOS> “Since I’m fairly certain as soon as I’m kicking Marco’s ass, he’s going to call for help, I want you two to make sure this is indeed a fair fight. Shoot anyone who interferes.” <EOS>
<BOS> You walk through the prison attempting to ignore the various threats and stares you’re getting. You remember that you have to show absolutely no weakness or fear. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well I certainly try to be and I guess this closes the chapter on the Crimson Talons?" <EOS>
<BOS> “We’re better off if they divide their force. Even if they’re just split into two groups, our chance at success doubles,” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> This response is met with a lot of derision. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I’ve heard that one before, just not that particular one. Great. Well at least you aren’t a Felian I guess.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wow, kid. You’re not going to last in prison if you take that approach. They see you come in like that and you’re gonna be sucking every dick in the joint and worse.” <EOS>
<BOS> Well Vera’s made it quite clear how she feels at any rate. <EOS>
<BOS> With one mermaid on your back nibbling your ear, another one swallowing your cock, and the third planting a kiss on your lips, you just let go and cease swimming. The mermaids do the rest by pulling you down. <EOS>
<BOS> “Officially we don’t, but ever since the ECS, well it helps to label things. At least until they’re gone anyway. In any case my name is Garrick and your recent exploits, along with your ongoing ones have caught our attention, so if you don’t mind, can we sit down to speak?” <EOS>
<BOS> “What, really?” <EOS>
<BOS> Well it’s a good question, what are you going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I’m a very important member of the Crimson Talons!” Tom says with some pride, you on the other hand look blank. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well sure, didn’t you at least want to know the ins and outs of the city, best places to steal from, the neighborhoods and all that? Look, I know I lied a bit, but you helped me out and with your skill set I got a feeling you’d do really well in our organization.” <EOS>
<BOS> You are attempting to reload your pistol, but you already know it’s not going do any good when Tanya is finally done tormenting Gwen’s body in death and tosses it aside to turn her attention towards you. <EOS>
<BOS> “You seen a lot o them have ya?” <EOS>
<BOS> Bruno takes your payment and you head to your old room. You take a quick inventory of your equipment and make plans to go case Reginald’s home, but then you hear noise outside and a quick peek out your window reveals that the Holgard Watch are putting down a group of dissidents and decide to stay put for a little while. <EOS>
<BOS> “What crime would that be, my prince?” Lorthander speaks through his raspy voice. <EOS>
<BOS> “Seems like you have something to say. Out with it, I think we’ve gotten to a place in our relationship where we can talk about anything now.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh, you're back." He rocks back on his worn boots and hooks a thumb in his cheek, popping it. "You'll be below deck, mostly. Different fates for different folks. Depends on what we think you're good for." <EOS>
<BOS> You both get to the top of the stairs and have to stop to get the damn things off of you before they gnaw through your clothes and your body. You start stabbing, burning and throwing the oversized rats against the walls. You’ve got bites all over you and you’re bleeding all over, but that’s nothing compared to your surviving underling who isn’t quite so lucky when a qweepa manages to bite into his neck, puncturing an artery. <EOS>
<BOS> "Certainly, fine ladies," you smile, and explain how you work with prompts to weave your tales. "The Empress has asked for horses, but I could still use a couple more things, such as a location, an object, or a character to build the story." <EOS>
<BOS> "If you don't mind," the crewmember looks to you as the other two argue. "Could you help me out? They won't share with each other. But they might bunk with you." <EOS>
<BOS> Vera’s thoughtful words are a little out of the ordinary, but not lost on you. Not like you don’t have similar thoughts on your own life at times. <EOS>
<BOS> “What seriously? We could fucking take him together!” you exclaim in anger. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, it’s a possible cure and I think you can help.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What the fuck?” you say to yourself and get up to leave. You must have wandered into some weird orgy room. <EOS>
<BOS> The Laughing Devil is barely functioning like it used to anymore. Long gone are the wild parties filled with college types. Now it’s starting to become a hang out for the dregs of the city. <EOS>
<BOS> While you knew Klint was always a bit obsessed with your sister, you never quite knew how bad it was until just now. He’s totally lost it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit! Don’t…” Elias utters. <EOS>
<BOS> "WHAT?! They had another child?! When?!" You exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wha…how?! I only just got here! You were having problems with her long before I arrived!” <EOS>
<BOS> You continue to curse yourself for being so stupid and not realizing something was up from the start. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya…I’m…sorry…” you utter before you pass the world. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well…yeah I suppose I’m not either and it was mostly in self-defense and an accident despite what everyone in town says. Still though, makes me wonder if I’m capable of killing again.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I see, and how do you know all this?” <EOS>
<BOS> Of course Tanya’s not at all worried about any of this, but that’s easy for her to say when she’s got all her new infernal powers now. Even with her help, it isn’t like you’ve got much defense against a bunch of highly trained shadow magic using killers. <EOS>
<BOS> She hits it again, but it keeps coming. Now she begins to panic, but still attempts to get off another shot. She misses though. <EOS>
<BOS> “You were invited to the Baroness’ yearly costume party? How the hell did that happen and why aren’t you immediately making preparations to go?!” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You see Warts lying under a table with a couple of big mugs of alcohol on it. Surprisingly, the owner has not thrown him out; unsurprisingly everyone is avoiding that table. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fine. As I said, I’ll take care of that. Right then; guess I’m off to get the priest and sort all that shit out. The sooner we get this rolling the better.” <EOS>
<BOS> Then everything goes cold and dark. When you wake next, you are in a rectangular stone room with a small bed, desk, and a chalk board with dates and circles. The walls are a bit charred near the door, as if a recent fire passed through, and the window is papered over. <EOS>
<BOS> "If you enjoyed this story," you find yourself whispering, so try again, "if you enjoyed this story, please contribute a coin or two to aid me in my Pilgrimage." You pass around the hat, and a few of the men and women put some coins in. A couple men glare as if you were begging in front of them, but the crowd is mostly cordial. When you get to the mage, he tosses in a large pouch. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s not like I ever had a choice.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t even hear the barkeep’s pitch anymore; your mind is just sort of a hazy blur between your thoughts and the ale. What did you do? What could you do? What are you going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> The pair of you just sit and hold each other in silence for quite awhile as you watch the sunset and then later the stars. One of the benefits of being bonded is not even having to speak. Sometimes one of you remembers a fond moment from your collective past and you both give a smile at each other, even an occasional laugh. <EOS>
<BOS> any longer than you have to, so you continue to make your way which soon isn’t as bad for the man made structure of the sewer is gone completely and you’re now heading into what looks like a natural cavern (with solid ground underneath you). <EOS>
<BOS> You don't have much luck though. Your other Talons aren't quite as "worldly" as your top lieutenants. There is one who has a lead though. <EOS>
<BOS> "But that's - " you frown. "But the mages theory of this connection is recent, yes? And the problems with memory and magic are recent, as well, yes?" <EOS>
<BOS> A man in an armored dark crimson robe turns his head, noticing you. “You’re back. And the Emperor?” Seth asks. <EOS>
<BOS> With those cryptic words, she leaves you. You look at the soft bed mournfully, fearing she might be right. You aren't sure what all is going on, but you have picked up that the mages have some animosity against storytellers right now. Perhaps you should return to the protection of the merchant caravan with it's guards - but can they really be trusted, either? Or do they just do the work of the highest bidder? <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I sent him and his people to kill Peter’s wizards. Did he do it?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> You pull your arm away. <EOS>
<BOS> "Damn it man, I told you not to look! Close your damn eyes! Just keep rowing, we're almost there! Get back sea sluts! Yargh! Yargh! Get back! You'll not get me with your wiles!" <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose…with that sort of reward, the risk is worth it. However, I’d like to have half of my payment now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m…sorry…I just…I can’t… just stay away from me.” She says and quickly runs off. <EOS>
<BOS> “But she’s nice! And good!” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay Vera, I can see some advantages for us going into this business and since you’ve got all the expertise, I’m going to hand this task for you to oversee.” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> Sneaks leaves you and you immediately go to see if Tanya is in her quarters. You already know what you’re going to say, because you’ve been saying it in your mind for a long time now, you’re just mentally preparing yourself the verbal (and possibly physical) repercussions of your confrontation. <EOS>
<BOS> And that’s so tragic that it causes you to laugh. <EOS>
<BOS> Remembering when your other carriage ride was attacked by bandits, you didn’t stick around and fight them, you took off and ran and it worked out (more or less). Seems like the same strategy should apply here. <EOS>
<BOS> “Me! You gotta take me! Seriously I will seriously suck your dick if you take me to this party.” Vera exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> “STOP HIDING BEHIND YER MAMA’S SKIRT AND GET OUT HERE MURDERER!” you hear a voice shout. <EOS>
<BOS> Madeline realizes that she might need to give you a fuller explanation so she proceeds to do so. <EOS>
<BOS> Despite this revelation and you being obviously upset, Vera is silent and doesn’t move from her spot. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe not, but forgive me if I’m less trusting of the Dornans than you are.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah I suppose it is.” Kol answers. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera kisses you goodbye and remarks about heading over to the slave mines. After she leaves its just you and your sister. <EOS>
<BOS> You take a purple in hand. A power courses through you, as if piggybacking on your blood. Your feet leave the floor. "This is strange," you murmur to yourself, attempting to take a step forward. Instead of walking, you glide on air, each 'step' you take crossing the normal distance of dozens. You can even lean to shift directions as the passage winds through the ground. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh good. Dat girl was a bitch.” <EOS>
<BOS> “They shoulda prayed ta Yag more!” you both say in unison and laugh. <EOS>
<BOS> “Do I even need to say it?” she asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I suppose that makes sense, but I’d say you’re not really in any danger of being perceived as weak by any of our underlings right now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, but that old bitch charges an arm and leg for it, so I need more money!” <EOS>
<BOS> You imagine this “war” won’t entirely be over just by the events tonight, but this was definitely a big turning point and probably in a few months, it’ll be over completely and then you can refocus back on business. <EOS>
<BOS> “Know about that do you?” she asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Your instincts kick in, and you swing at the man, but you're a little rusty in the combat area. This man however isn't and dodges your swing and then smashes you in the face with some brass knuckles. <EOS>
<BOS> Spryce gunts. "You'll have to ask the captain about that. And he's still waiting. Upper deck, Captain's cabin - can't miss it." <EOS>
<BOS> “Fine...what?” he prods. <EOS>
<BOS> "I don't have time to explain it all. I have to get back to the bar before they get antsy." She picks at the bandana wrapping her brown hair. "I hate to say this, since I promised you a room and all - but you might want to consider going back to the caravan early. Being with the merchants will give you some protection, protection you won't have here in the dark of night." <EOS>
<BOS> “Whatever, I don’t really want to hear about how you spoiled your other girlfriend right now. It’s bad enough that continually criticize me and say I’m not as good as sister.” <EOS>
<BOS> The well-dressed man with a thin mustache is Percy and has been the more talkative of the two. The other by the name of Toz is some sort of greenskin halfbreed also well dressed. Probably of orc heritage since he’s much bigger than Warts was. He also doesn’t talk much and mainly just stands around looking intimidating. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, I don’t shit where I eat, so if you don’t mind, get the fuck out of here and go blow somebody who cares!” <EOS>
<BOS> "It's true," you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, the sewers are the best way to get around the city. The guards don’t patrol as much down here and even when they do, they don’t patrol certain areas.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Supportive? I just told you all the shit I’ve done for her!” <EOS>
<BOS> First couple cages you pass are empty. The next one has a decaying smell as you pass, but nobody is in it. You notice on the other side of the road a couple of the cages have bodies in them, but seeing as they aren’t moving, you can only guess you’re probably walking by corpses. <EOS>
<BOS> “I know that too, it’s just…okay…I’m just a little concerned that we aren’t doing too much directly against the Ebony Claw Syndicate. I mean shouldn’t we be doing something more to decrease their power? Their presence hasn’t exactly decreased in the city and if anything it has only gotten stronger.” You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> “We still have an understanding with the Baroness. So, we’re not that bad off.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well maybe it’s a little paranoid of me, but most of the time when someone like me achieves something far beyond his status and then begins calling himself stuff like king or emperor, very bad things happen to him.” <EOS>
<BOS> Arriving on the other side of the river, you give a look back to see that the villagers are all still staggering after you. You then run off into the woods, knowing that you can lose them there. <EOS>
<BOS> No. You’ve seen and done much in your life thanks to leaving that boring town. After all, you’re here in baroness’ palace! You’re just in a rut that’s all. When you get back, you’re going to shake things up within the League. Maybe expand again, maybe even to a new city like Hessla or Klyton. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um…really? I mean great! That’s great boss! She should be coming by tonight.” Camid exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> “Anyway, Peter’s been at this for years ever since he got exiled. He’s suffered many set backs in his quest to retake Holgard. Every time he’s been on the verge of being ready, something has happened. This was partially thanks to the Ebony Claw Syndicate sabotaging his efforts in Delantium, and sometimes even the Temple of Fel would hinder his efforts as well. However, since things have changed drastically over the years in this city, he’s in the best position he’s ever been in to retake this place.” <EOS>
<BOS> You start making your way upstairs, but stop to ask one question. <EOS>
<BOS> “Trust me it’s even weirder for me, so is that how you found me? By reputation?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Nope, you aren’t. Though you aren’t considered a cold blooded murderer there anymore. After dad saved Annah’s life she told everyone what happened and there were a couple other reluctant witnesses that stepped up and cleared your name a few months after you left.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You quite welcome, and who is your companion here? She certainly seems to have a better grasp on the dress code. I dare say this dress is better than a few of the boring nobles here.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I have. I don’t think he likes me though. In fact I think he’s got a deep-seated dislike of women in general. I’m sure it has something to do with his mother being a lesbian or something.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Not that it’s any of your business, but no.” <EOS>
<BOS> The last item is a dark glass bottle of perfume in the shape of a rocking horse with one red hoof. You are sure the Empress has many fine perfumes, but this is a one-of-a-kind signature scent, "Scarlet Hoof," made by the perfumer Callius before his death. Supposedly safe to wear around horses without disturbing them, it's an exotic blend of woody oils, apple, horse sweat, amber, and elevated florals. The proprietor offers some further juicy details: Callius actually designed the perfume for the Empress herself, but the two had a falling out before he could present it at her birthday, and instead he met an untimely end by the claws of one of her tigers. The shopkeeper obtained the perfume as part of a lot bought by auction when Callius's estate was sold off by the merchant's guild. You are certain the perfume will please the Empress, but it's also the most expensive of the items at 75 silver. <EOS>
<BOS> Your gaze falls on the man speaking out. He nervously looks around, hoping someone nearby will support his decision. <EOS>
<BOS> "Uh huh...let's cut the bullshit." <EOS>
<BOS> “Why not? You spend most of your time walking around the city anyway when you’re pilfering pocket in your free time. Not saying that you have to be the one to speak with them, but you could bring it to Tom’s attention and I’m sure he’ll be receptive. I’m sure when we build up our numbers AND wealth we can start branching out a bit more again. Like property and fronts.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Guess so, or it does for me at any rate." <EOS>
<BOS> "And Malong Square!" The woman in pink explains when you give her a questioning glance, "It's a fertile field to the east of here, square, a few farspans on each side. The Wyrm Empress recently conquered the territory, and is quite proud of it, but it's been sitting there for months as she can't decide what to do with it." <EOS>
<BOS> "Are we going to brick up the dirt walls of these rooms or something similar? Not that I don't appreciate the work that's gone into this, but right now the aesthetics are more underground goblin lair, rather than secret criminal headquarters." Zal says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, he’s gonna want proof you know me first, so tell him the phrase: The Duchess sure had a velvet throat. He’ll know what it means.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well go find two dicks to suck then, because you’re not getting ten silver from me.” You say and shut the door on Randi who shouts some obscenities at you from the hallway. <EOS>
<BOS> You hear shouting and the galloping of several horses. A look outside your window and you see a bunch of figures on horseback armed with spear type weapons and bows. At this range you think they might be green skinned. Probably orcs given the noises they’re making. <EOS>
<BOS> Mira grabs for the pitcher of wine and pours it into a goblet. She offers it out for the Captain to take. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s you! You were the one I freed from that cage!” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> Sneaks said the effects should have worn off by now since you don’t even see her that much. Granted you aren’t thinking about her all the time, but if you ever have the chance to be around her (Like you do now) you’re going to take it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thank you sir.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t see what happens next, but you certainly hear it when a guttural scream is heard followed by the sound of flesh being ripped, bones being cracked and then a piece of arm being tossed over your head. <EOS>
<BOS> Percy sits down and you’re wondering what all this is about. <EOS>
<BOS> "And that's still my final offer. You don't like it, well you better go crawl in whatever hole you hide in from the militia because I am NOT going to let you use the place while it's still in my name. So it's five thousand or you're leaving my tavern either peacefully or by the militia. I got nothing to lose. You're in this position because YOU chose a life of wickedness. Deal with the consequences." <EOS>
<BOS> “So I’ve heard. Got a better description than that?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I agree. Better for business all around.” <EOS>
<BOS> After you’re done unloading everything, the driver mentions that if you’re looking for a place to unwind, the Sultry Siren is a good location. He then bids you good night and takes his leave. <EOS>
<BOS> “And are you seriously telling me, you don’t want THIS?” she says and forcefully puts your hands on her tits. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’ll get that money back and more if you just follow me. I have a vision for this city and if we unify we could be greater than the Guild or the Syndicate ever was!” <EOS>
<BOS> You end the conversation on a positive note of looking forward to this unexpected upcoming event. You suppose since Vera’s going to need extra help, you have more of the ex-Black Hooks help her with getting the docks fixed and ready and tell some of your old veterans to start capturing these Coalition fuckers and bringing them back to the temple in chains. <EOS>
<BOS> You signal to move forward. Suddenly, the castle halls fill with a slow, resonating laugh. Dark shadows fly above you, not more than a blur. The torches extinguish simultaneous, leaving you in darkness. You hold your weapon out, defensively, but do not aimlessly swing for fear of striking an ally. Not everyone holds the same resolve, and you hear the clash of swords along with cries from those wounded. <EOS>
<BOS> “I sort of was afraid you’d say something like that.” <EOS>
<BOS> You take the opportunity to roll sideway and wiggle out from under the dead cultist. You catch a few short punches to your side, but you eventually get free. Reginald despite being in pain begins to do likewise. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora steps back from you a bit giving a slightly perturbed look. <EOS>
<BOS> There is little light in the wagon, save for what’s coming through the very small windows at the very top of it. Still, you manage to examine a few of the other prisoners and fortune strikes again when you see one with a black claw tattoo sitting across from you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Dad, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you or mom. I’ll make sure the medallion is around my neck good.” Kol says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Bad? Why would you feel bad? Klint was an asshole, I’m certainly not upset over it.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Now I'm wondering if I should make a donation to Yag's temple, because his luck was definitely with us today. That went way better than I thought it would." Zal says. <EOS>
<BOS> Why not, it isn't like you got anything else important going on. <EOS>
<BOS> “As I said, I have to make a delivery to a man by the name of Crasnov. He runs a pottery shop by the same name. If you could take this package to him when you reach the city, I’d certainly be in your debt.” <EOS>
<BOS> Gloom drops his friendly persona, though not to a hostile expression, but more of a serious one. <EOS>
<BOS> Your answer is met with another strike knocking you to the floor. <EOS>
<BOS> “First, I had it under control, second, you already stabbed him several times, the last thing you need is to outright kill…” <EOS>
<BOS> You tell Heather where you saw the fighting going on and she goes over to the right side of the building and sees for herself. It’s still a stalemate from what you can tell and fortunately Heather says this will be easy to take care of. <EOS>
<BOS> “Let’s get started, shall we? How did you know we were coming? How did you know to ambush us?” Seth asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Dying face down in shit water is one of the less dignified ways to go out, but you don’t dwell on it to much before one of Holgard’s finest puts you down for good with a bullet to your head. <EOS>
<BOS> For the first two nights, the audience is responsive, and you are 120 silver richer for it. But the third night, something feels different. There are more people in the Sand Rat Inn than usual, including several mages, and many downcast faces peer down into empty cups. <EOS>
<BOS> “Cause it’s the safest way. Even the bandit types don’t like goin’ near it and nobody from the Spider Fang tribe is brave enough either. Sides, it’s really only haunted sometimes.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What about…you know what, forget it.” <EOS>
<BOS> After about a couple of minutes of slobbering over each other, Madeline finally comes up for air. <EOS>
<BOS> By the time her father showed up, she was ready to run off but then he presented your soul to her. He said he would only give it to her if she embraced her demonic heritage and return home. He then of course told her what you said to him and if it was a choice between disobeying and saving your soul from eternal torment, her choice was easy. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, back at Rook’s mansion, you came by with a bag of bloody heads and threatened to rape and kill me if I didn’t let you in.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I got these!” you say and hold up a large leather pouch containing the unicorn testicles. <EOS>
<BOS> “I see…wait…how many guys have you been with?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? I don’t believe you. Vera would never betray me, let alone hand me over to the Syndicate!” <EOS>
<BOS> "Wait, who do you think I am?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> You do exactly what Rifiv says and try to focus on just rowing as you close your eyes. It isn't easy though since you can still hear the sounds of battle and the captain shouting the entire time. You also feel a bit of pulling at not just the oars, but your arms as well. You don't know how the old man is holding out so well. <EOS>
<BOS> “Remember, no more of your people in Delantium.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What happened to him?” <EOS>
<BOS> "No, you aren't." He leans back in his chair and steeples his fingers. "Probably a good thing, for you, that you don't physically have much value. But you've opened my eyes to a lot of possibilities, and made me realize just how much money we were dumping into the sea. You've made us a great deal of profit, so I'm inclined to be lenient. We can always pick up a new doctor, later." <EOS>
<BOS> “Luck? I’m on my way to prison!” <EOS>
<BOS> You fall off the carriage with the blunderbuss still in hand, and land hard on your back, but luckily still out of the way of the carriage wheels. However, upon you impact with the ground, your hand was around the trigger of the blunderbuss, which you accidently pulled. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well the part of that is easy to answer, because it relates back to my break away from outside influence. You see, the next closest chapter, which exists in the Delantium Kingdom where they still maintain close ties to the ECS, doesn’t exactly approve of THIS particular chapter. Hence I can expect no help from them. As for the Baroness, well let’s just say she’s a politician first and even more of a dabbler than a typical ECS lieutenant. It probably doesn’t help that I cut most ties with her on our temple other than bare minimum cordial tolerance for her superficial intrigue on our faith.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m going to go see Madeline.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Pretty sure the entire world works that way, still I can’t argue with your logic. Look, I know who you are. We actually met when you were working for the Syndicate.” <EOS>
<BOS> You still don’t exactly know WHY you’re as drawn to her as you are. Well you do and it’s probably due to her demonic heritage and whatever powers of charm she put on you. (Accidently you guess given her stand offish personality towards you) <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, don’t even go there with the dad thing. I’m not even that much older than her. I trust you can look after things here for awhile?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Now you’re just being melodramatic and ridiculous.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I was wondering when you’d recognize me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that’s certainly an interesting plan you got there and I can only assume the initial set up of it was equally as interesting. I just don’t think I can loan you Olaf though. Sorry.” Mr. Reynolds says. <EOS>
<BOS> "I am what you would call a muse," he said, "those beings born of the planet who inspire the creatures of the world. But call me Sandman, if you like." The blue-skinned man stood. "I will give dreams to the world." He raised his arms, and something like dust flew from his fingertips towards the soldiers below. Where they breathed it in, they fell asleep. "For now, I give them a vision of the future, should they bow to the mages." <EOS>
<BOS> “No, unless you want to go through Flynn’s ritual and go get yourself an unsuspecting girl to sacrifice.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh no. He’s very much legitimate. It’s just that after he had a disagreement with his father and fled the city, all records were pretty much erased of him. He’s basically been living in exile in the Delantium Kingdom. Peter’s disagreement with his father involved the whole breaking away from the Delantium Kingdom in the first place. Peter was the only one who saw it as treason and remained loyal to Delantium. Over the years Peter has been trying to amass an army to take back the city.” <EOS>
<BOS> “The Ebony Claw doesn’t like to waste potential talent. Or at least I don’t, hence why we’re having this pleasant conversation. If you can convince your friend or friends to join you in seeing that the future is the Ebony Claw, then I have no problem with them joining as well. Quite frankly, we’ll probably need the manpower.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, boss.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Thank you." You take her chair before anyone gets too far, and many of the parents and children sit down again. "I'm Dustan Palmer, a storyteller from Syphyr, the great continent," you introduce yourself, "from the mystical, mysterious Dreaming Forest. Now, who would like to choose the hero of our first tale?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh this should be good. Go on about why you feel this way…whatever the fuck your name is.” <EOS>
<BOS> In the ancient garden of the gods, twelve creatures of strength, beauty, and skill were each granted a fragment of a map. Only together would the pieces lead to a great treasure, but each animal wanted the glory of the discovery, and the treasure, for himself. The bear, like the others, grew bored with the search. He returned to his favorite fishing hole and berry bush, and amused himself with the treasures he had in reach. The bear did not notice when his own piece of the map fell in the garden. <EOS>
<BOS> “Like what? More ideas about how to improve things around here? I know how you’re not satisfied with how things are around here, but then I suppose you aren’t the only one.” <EOS>
<BOS> “…um no why?” you say and then silently cursing yourself that your lie didn’t come out natural. <EOS>
<BOS> “Damn it, refugee, why didn’t you stop them?” he spits. <EOS>
<BOS> Elana doesn’t make many more complaints fortunately and when she does it’s mostly at the driver anyway, though you can imagine you’ll soon be on the receiving end completely. <EOS>
<BOS> You leave the boy and continue on your destination. When you enter Mr. Reynolds' office, he's reading the paper. <EOS>
<BOS> "You said he'd get the job done and as usual, you're a man of your word." You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “I think most of dem are orphans due to the feud with da elves an’ they’re here to either start a new life or tryin’ ta make some coin for da tribe.” <EOS>
<BOS> Later in the middle of the night, you return to Gilo’s and break into the back door which has such a simple lock it’s child’s play to you, then again you don’t imagine most people would bother breaking into this place. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not obsessed.” You exclaim which causes a look of skepticism from Sneaks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I love you.” <EOS>
<BOS> You waste no time in following him, fighting and dodging along the way. You kick the door in and you find the Inquisitor standing in the middle of the room with his mace held ready for battle. An old couple stands further behind, frightened out of their minds and holding each other. <EOS>
<BOS> A few days and a trip to the tailor’s later, you’re dressed and ready to go to this thing. You’re not exactly comfortable in this type of clothing, but many League members compliment you on your new threads. Warts of course has something to say. <EOS>
<BOS> You head to where the carriages are getting ready to leave and with a few extra bribes, bullshit explanations, and general apathy of the soldiers, you’re waved into one of the carriages heading to Arcanius. <EOS>
<BOS> “I have decided to undertake a journey, a long pilgrimage to the northern hemisphere, past ocean, over island, and through forest to the distant Grove of the Muses.” The murmuring in the crowd grows, and there are several cries of protest. You hold up a hand. “I have grown old beside you, but I must return to my cherished Ivani. If the muses are with me, I will return to you someday. But for now, I wish to share with you a final tale.” <EOS>
<BOS> Looks like you picked your new allies wisely. Hopefully this all proves to be even more useful in the future. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'll take that as a yes." Zal responds and kisses you. <EOS>
<BOS> “There’s been sightings of a wyvern heading towards the Ellehorn Forest. It’s as good of a place for someone who doesn’t want to be found,” Seth replies. <EOS>
<BOS> With a throaty yell, Ardan attacks you with his axe. Fortunately you’re a lot more agile than he is, so you manage to dodge his swings. You can’t even fight back, since you doubt if you could overpower him physically and you certainly can’t kill him. <EOS>
<BOS> Percy seems surprised to hear you accuse him of this, but he soon returns to his smiling self. Toz on the other hand is showing a stone face looking like he really wants to get on with the fighting. <EOS>
<BOS> "The grief you have for her loss." Willow speaks in your mind, as Ivani did. You imagine you see a flash of violet cross her eyes. I understand your sadness, as you understand mine. Will you join me in sorrow?" <EOS>
<BOS> You reach for your weapon and then a figure loom over your head punching you in the face several times. He then proceeds to break your arms, before dragging you off your bed and then breaking your legs. Bones stick out of the skin, your screams are loud and the pain is great, but you're in the sewers and there will be no help. <EOS>
<BOS> Ardan scoffs as you continue. <EOS>
<BOS> ‘Here. I got your latest supply of Gray.” <EOS>
<BOS> Suddenly you hear several loud explosions, but this time coming from the direction of Nightfall! You immediately start running back in that direction and bump into one of your people along the way. <EOS>
<BOS> You step into a pit trap and fall directly onto several sharpened branches. The pain is excruciating since you weren’t lucky enough for the wooden spikes to kill you right away. You howl out in agony for hours, but nobody comes. <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sigh) I know you’re not used to hearing this, but spit it out! Tell me what this guy wanted.” <EOS>
<BOS> You exhale deeply and get up from your desk. <EOS>
<BOS> “I was told Olaf was a champion pit fighter and this would be easy for him.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah! You’re no assassin and even if you are, you’re too damn young to have been at it for very long, let alone skilled enough to take on five of us. My guess is, you’re that rich bitch’s escort or something. Not sure why she’d take a little thing like you though as a guard. Guess being rich doesn’t mean being smart which is evident by the very fact she’s staying here.” <EOS>
<BOS> You waste no time and try to climb down your tree as fast as you can. Fortunately, the bandits are have decided to have a little fun before killing him directly. They proceed to continue kicking Warts and don’t notice you at all. <EOS>
<BOS> "Come on! Come on! You're too fucking slow! Move your ass!" He orders. <EOS>
<BOS> “Short while? It’s been ten years,” you reply, thinking of the monastery. <EOS>
<BOS> You shake your head that you’re considering this. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera isn’t exactly buying your excuse, but she’s buttoning up her shirt and getting back up. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not a violent criminal anyway. I’m just in here because I was a little down on my luck and stole some food. Unfortunately Klyton is pretty overzealous when it comes to their laws.” The man goes on to say. <EOS>
<BOS> "Did they? How surprising." The Empress scrinches her brow. "Offical Shina, have these three noble women given hair pins from the treasury." <EOS>
<BOS> "It went well. We aren't going to get a bunch of problems." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> "I could," she pauses for a moment. "A slug." <EOS>
<BOS> You soon no longer feel the crossbow at your back and that’s when you know it’s okay to move again. <EOS>
<BOS> “You are not fucking dying. This isn’t a fatal wound you sissy. Get up and get yourself patched up.” You say and start motioning him to get up. <EOS>
<BOS> Also, while Klyton has no jurisdiction over Teckleville, it has been known to apprehend wanted criminals from elsewhere trying to hide out there. Not to mention the place in general has a fairly good reputation (And they want to keep it that way) as far as its own security goes. <EOS>
<BOS> Ponyride smiles and nods. <EOS>
<BOS> “You won’t be getting ANY sort of job if you continue to abuse me!” <EOS>
<BOS> "What if you could save her?" <EOS>
<BOS> You chuckle. <EOS>
<BOS> You cough blood and wheeze as death is finally catching up to you. Tanya goes over to you and starts telling you to hold on while she frantically attempts to look for something in her room to help you, but there isn’t anything and it wouldn’t help anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright, you seem to have come up with one good idea that’s gone over well, so I’m trusting you on this Warts. Go make the preparations.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright, you have any idea if Zamed is coming around anytime soon?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “I see. Did you…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, I’m sure that will change soon. I mean from what I can tell, you’re a rising star in their organization. I have full confidence that you will be soon accepted.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You know who I am?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Good eye." The man puts away his monocle and nods. "With a good cleaning and polish, this could sale for between 400 and 500 silver to the right client. I'll buy it from you for 150." <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve actually taken an interest in sneaking into the medical school and stealing various drugs lying around. While it’s not exactly an area you’ve been into before, you’re fairly certain there’s a market in selling typically unavailable drugs (and more reliable). <EOS>
<BOS> “You sure you’re not also going out of revenge?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Pfft, I ain’t got no personal stash. Snuffit takes it all. Speakin’ of her, I think I’ll be getting back to her. Seems like this city is a lost cause an’ if you’re smart you should just get the hell out too.” <EOS>
<BOS> “He’s fine and she’s been nothing but helpful. I mean hell, she’s probably one of the few people I’d trust with him.” <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya sits next to you on the bed and now her eyes look less hard, the non-infernal side is showing. <EOS>
<BOS> You shake your head at this situation. <EOS>
<BOS> Well this isn’t freedom, but at least it’s a glimmer of hope. <EOS>
<BOS> And this point Tanya takes her hood off and you not only see her lovely face clearly, but two little horns. She must go to great lengths to arrange her hair to cover them, along with wearing the hood. <EOS>
<BOS> You clutch the staff. A blue glow comes into your eyes, and a hundred stories that will not fade burst to be released from your tongue. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, pit fighting champ! You okay? You see me? You know where you’re at?” Zalmora asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You continue along the road, which as you guessed starts alternating from being intact, to dirt with a few stones to being little more than a well worn path in the grass. Even the occasional signs aren’t much help given that many are flat out damaged in some way. <EOS>
<BOS> However, once again life is not always so simple. <EOS>
<BOS> You smile and point out to Zal this success. <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t completely drained of energy, and you probably could try to run, they were arguing about not killing you in the street and given all the commotion going on, they may abandon their task if you prove to be too much trouble right now. <EOS>
<BOS> “This better be some really good help if you’re making all these demands.” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s then that you realize the mental attack taking place. Each member of the company is seeing a vision, an illusionary attack on their willpower. The world fades in and out, sound gets louder than quiet. A pair of hands grip your throat and forcefully pull you in the air. Your face is close to your adversary, and you faintly see the features of Seth, his eyes narrowing as they meet yours. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh yes, you were doing that bum fight business. Well, you won't have to be doing that anymore. You'll get to use your other natural talent." <EOS>
<BOS> You collapse in despair and begin to weep, ignoring the several new explosions causing more of the temple to crumble around you. You brought all of this on them. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t think they care this time. I mean thanks to your magical shenanigans they don’t make enough from us for it to make much difference either way I suppose. If the League suffers severely from this invasion, the ECS will most likely just come in directly and finish it off.” <EOS>
<BOS> “WELL? Aren’t you going to say anything?!” Garrick shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> “My return was inevitable. It is a great honor to be the vessel in which my return manifests. In time you will learn the truth of that statement.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t have time for this…” <EOS>
<BOS> “What?! After everything you said and did to prevent Fel from contacting Kol, you’re now saying it’s perfectly fine?” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “So you’ve said many times in the past, but I think things still worked out with me in charge.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re bonded with a demon. Doesn’t matter if she wasn’t born a pure blood anymore because she’s obviously embraced her heritage fully now. That bond might be dormant and perhaps even non-malignant, but it exists. Which means at any time she can reach you, but it also means YOU can reach her. You of course don’t have the means, but I on other hand do. I’m proposing that we perform a ritual to bring this Tanya back here.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe not, but I believe that they at least think they’ll make things harder. Maybe even to the point that you’ll give up.” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “And then?” <EOS>
<BOS> As he begs for you to stop killing him all you can think of is Klint doing the same thing and you drive your short sword through his chest telling him to shut the fuck up and die the entire time. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes gentlemen, I did kill a lot of people and if you’d like to not be on that list, you’ll either join me or get the hell out my way. Because it’s like this; I really want to be in charge. Are there any objections?” <EOS>
<BOS> “What? Seriously? Weren’t aware you were interested in me.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Stealing yes, food no. It was a job and well I’ll tell you on the way back to Klyton. Come on kid.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Probably not me, but someone will. Probably of much lesser importance of course. I was just here this time to extend the hand and make the deal as it were. Still glad we came to one.” <EOS>
<BOS> “There was one other person that we found that you seemed to have a bit of affection for, though killing her wouldn’t have really changed much. Sure you would have been pissed, maybe a little upset, but it wouldn’t have devastated you. If anything you would have just tried to retaliate, wasting more of our time.” <EOS>
<BOS> You turn to see Seth holding a bloodied man by his brown wavy hair. By the man’s armor, you assume, rightly, he’s he one in charge. While the man looks distressed, he’s not in panic, unlike most would be in his position. He must be in charge. <EOS>
<BOS> “No! We’re not doing anything Vera. Just put your tits away and get your hands off my dick.” <EOS>
<BOS> The jig is up. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I see. Yeah I suppose that might put a crimp in your trust level which is probably low enough seeing our line of work and all.” Zalmora remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> This is insane. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah. I know their faith is for the most part still chummy with the Syndicate, but ever since Shade split from the main faith, this particular temple seems to be independent and follow its own agenda. I guess we can get a feel of where their alliances lie at least. Sort of wish Vera was still around sometimes as an extra pair of hands and eyes, but she’s more useful in Jicol. I think she needed the change of scenery anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’d be a fool if I didn’t have some concerns about my current situation. Though I wasn’t really here to insult you or show disrespect, I was here about a potential alliance. My intentions are nothing but positive.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Because you like coin and you’re not adverse to great risk. Why else would you have hired yourself out as a privateer for the Delantium Kingdom and getting in the middle of their war with Nichan? You could have easily made a comfortable living robbing fat merchant ships. Given all that, with my plan you stand to make a lot of coin and for significantly less risk.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I can’t even look?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Y’know it’s probably too late at this point for it to matter and the Syndicate would probably prefer this to remain a secret just in case they want to use this person in the future, but given all the shit I had to go through because of you AND the Syndicate, I’m giving a big fuck you to both and telling you because at this point what is the worst either of you could do to me?” <EOS>
<BOS> You are hit by a solid black beam of dark energy and feel your life force not just draining, but being ripped from you. Every part of you feels like its being eaten alive which might be somewhat true as your body begins to shrivel and you collapse to the floor, too weak to stand up any longer, let alone hold your weapon. <EOS>
<BOS> “She would. Look, I’d love to stand around and just bullshit with you, but as I said, I’m fucking busy today and I’d like to get in a nap first.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I thought you said you weren’t going to say anything.” <EOS>
<BOS> Not to mention repairs on the open sea with only half the crew also take a long damn time. On the plus side, you've learned your way around a ship a lot more, though you fully intend on never using this knowledge again if you can help it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that’s something I need to talk to you about because it could possibly affect the League.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wouldn’t have been fun for me either. Sheesh. You couldn’t just heal me you’re your new infernal magic abilities instead?” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s alright. If we let her go, the Empire would spare no expense to find us. It’s better this way,” Seth says, sending another look to Richard. <EOS>
<BOS> “No use in thinking about that now. Look, there are the ruins,” you whisper back, eyeing the crumbling stone and scattered rocks in the overgrown grass. The archway, where a gate once sat, lies open, inviting you in, promising safe shelter. <EOS>
<BOS> “Qweepas. They’re these…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Madeline…please. Tell me what’s going on.” <EOS>
<BOS> Several ECS member congregate around Ponyride’s cell. Ponyride himself is a muscular average sized man with a shaved head. He has several tattoos that in some way signify his allegiance to his organization. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well I hate a lot of things right now, but I’m willing to make that sacrifice. Now I didn’t address this before, but did you even pack anything useful with you, I notice you’re travelling kind of light.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, I don’t really give a shit. I’m just saying that I’m OUT of Holgard regardless of that happening or not.” <EOS>
<BOS> "What are you looking for?" they asked, coming over. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera’s right about someone potentially “going rogue” and just fucking off to do their own thing so you’ll have to really lay down the punishment implications to everyone about doing such a thing. Which is exactly what you do. You also tell everyone to not create a bloodbath and if they do, they need to take steps in covering their tracks. Last thing you want is to create too much attention. <EOS>
<BOS> “Mm. Well, I need to get back to my home and patch him up.” <EOS>
<BOS> "(Cough cough) Shit! What did Junior do exactly?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “We’ll see each other again Warts.” You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> “Captain Elias of the Kraken.” A fat bearded man slightly shorter than Zamed says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course he was a champion. Decades ago. Look at him, that beautiful white mane and beard he has isn’t just for show, it denotes age! He’s old and not the young killing machine he used to be. Oh sure he’s good for intimidating a few deadbeats and even knocking them around a bit, but if I let him go do what you want him to do, he’s going to die even if he somehow manages to succeed. And while Olaf wouldn’t mind such a proud warrior’s death, I happen to be good friends with his wife and she’d be very upset and I can’t have that on my conscience.” <EOS>
<BOS> Mr. Reynolds chuckles a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> As you walk away you decide to call it a night. While you didn’t really engage in any lucrative opportunities yourself, you’re sort of glad to learn that Annah is alive and well. You suppose you do miss her a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera’s unbelievably fanatical devotion to you is really starting to reach a level that you didn’t think was possible. Whatever “condition” is fucking with your head, it’s going to have a really difficult time in getting you to actually kill her <EOS>
<BOS> Of course there was your sister as well, though you probably thought about her more since you used some of the knowledge from her stories to help you through this. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not that I’m not flattered by the offer, but weren’t you part of the Syndicate AND the Guild? Seems suspicious that both were destroyed while you’re still here.” Another adds. <EOS>
<BOS> Not questioning your leadership again, your people follow your orders and you run off towards the docks. You just hope Heather managed to get there since your own trip to the docks isn’t without struggle. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya…I…” <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t think you’ve ever seen Tom quite so angry before, or at least extremely annoyed. Not wishing for this to get worse, you back away and leave Tom’s office. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fine, we can leave if you really wants, but I’m just sayin’ we haven’t gone through the entire house yet.” <EOS>
<BOS> Since you can’t find her or detect anyone else roaming these halls, you decide that you might as well see if there actually is anything here that you might be worth taking. <EOS>
<BOS> You consider it. The woman did give you a place to wait out the storm, even if it is just a patch of floor, so in a way you owe her. But Ronin is clearly bored, and a story might help his mood in his convalescence - whether he's healing from a minor cold or a severe wasting illness of near-certain death. He's unlikely to have any money, but it would pass the time. And so long as you are quiet, his mother won't know or find out until you are well on your way. <EOS>
<BOS> At first you’re confused to as why he’s acting this way and doesn’t see that it’s you, but then you think it might be the fact that you’re wearing a red robe. <EOS>
<BOS> You have to wonder why Sneaks didn’t just take off like he did last time. Unless he really is that pissed at you, which you assume he is, otherwise he wouldn’t have bothered with all this and you would have easily taken over long before now. <EOS>
<BOS> Not to mention that while you get the idea that this Ebony Claw Syndicate is the big swingin’ dick around here, you’re not really keen on the whole idea of having to “work” for someone else. <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, this is the first time I’ve checked on you both. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I can see that you have some strong feelings on all this.” <EOS>
<BOS> “And depending on the wizard, even that could be fairly easy. Personally I send them to at least bring down a beast of some sort, but many staff member have gotten so complacent they usually just tell them to go hunt down various plants. Honestly it’ll probably be the most excitement they’ll ever get if they stay in Klyton. And if they do stay, they’ll probably become staff and they’ll send their students on some piss easy task, because hey that’s what they had to do so why break the cycle? Feh, it’s really fucking pathetic of what this institution has become.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay. We can still work through this.” She replies calmly. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ugh, they’re fucking annoying.” <EOS>
<BOS> You then hear a loud explosion coming from below, the entire boat rocks and you fall to the deck. You aren't sure what happened, but it can't be good because the smell of smoke is very prominent and while you aren't entirely sure yet, but you think the boat might be starting to sink. <EOS>
<BOS> You sit up and pull out your pistol which causes the closest thug’s eyes to widen. <EOS>
<BOS> “Any suggestions on where to go first when I get to the city?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I never got the impression it was serious.” <EOS>
<BOS> You sit on the ground and stare at the ocean for awhile. You weep a bit at your loss and a sense of depression hangs over you. You even briefly consider heading over the cliff, but you dismiss that idea pretty quickly. Suicidal thoughts have never been something you’ve dwelled on and you can only imagine how disgusted Tanya would be with you if you did. <EOS>
<BOS> Your sword is laid out in front of you. You eye the familiar sheathe, the protector of your most treasured possession. As if still at the monastery, a voice rings in your head. Not the Unbroken voice, the one tainted by darkness, but the voice of the monks. <EOS>
<BOS> After coming to an agreement with Gloom, you leave the temple and make your way back to your headquarters. <EOS>
<BOS> “Another hard day of work, am I right?” you say sitting down at the same table. <EOS>
<BOS> Waves of new scents begin to compete with the seaweed and fish of the shore - sour citrus, spicy pepper, sweet cinnamon, and savory tumeric, as well as the mingling perfumes of a thousand people walking the streets. There is no large open space with market stalls here - just rows and rows of shops and restaurants, and lines of people on either side of the roads. You do come across a little square park, but no one seems to stay there long. It would be difficult to gather a crowd. A man looks to be setting up some sort of instrument in one corner - perhaps a street musician? Before you can reach him, a mustached man in a red uniform of some kind approaches him first and orders him to leave. Eavesdropping, you overhear that public begging and busking, of any kind, are not allowed in Scaleport public areas. <EOS>
<BOS> You rub your hands through your hair. <EOS>
<BOS> "Ivani!" you cry, kneeling beside her. "Can you see? What do you feel?" <EOS>
<BOS> Whether the bullet killed him or not doesn’t really matter since the demons warping in aren’t under his control anymore and instead of immediately getting themselves killed by the students, a couple of them attack the easy prey on the ground instead. You watch a couple of them take chunks from the wizard and go bounding away. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, nothing actually. Didn’t know there was another one of Vlad’s spawn running around. Wait, is this another one of his bastards, like you?” you ask with a smirk. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ardan, I didn’t have sex with Keira.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Instead of buying it outright, I'd suggest just getting the owners to work with us. That way nothing really changes up front, but we don't spend money and we're the ones really running things." Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> Warts and you trudge along a dirt path for quite sometime until it disappears completely. <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t sure how succubi are supposed to act and granted she’s not a full blood one, but it’s very strange that despite her obvious descent into morally questionable actions, she’s still very attached to you. (Or maybe you’re just not used to a very loving girlfriend, your only one before Tanya was Annah) She’s also starting to change physically. Her horns for one are a little bigger and her eyes now have a permanent other worldly look. <EOS>
<BOS> “Pfft, yeah right. You call the militia and they’d probably shut this whole place down. You’re selling booze without a license in the basement and one of your rooms is being used by an unlicensed whore.” <EOS>
<BOS> You find an empty table, put your back against the wall and partake in your meal. You constantly watch the door expecting trouble to come in. <EOS>
<BOS> Time passes and eventually in-between the moaning and grunting, suddenly Vera begins to cough and she nearly collapses to the floor, but you prevent that by holding her up, though you can tell it’s starting. <EOS>
<BOS> “Jerk. We were training, not fighting for real,” she addresses you. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Annah turns around on all fours and turns her head to the side to give you that “What’re you waiting for, start fucking!” look. Without thinking about it anymore, you down the drink in your hand, toss it aside and start to unbuckle your pants. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 32 <EOS>
<BOS> “A magic school?” <EOS>
<BOS> “It…it doesn’t make sense! WHY YOU?! There have been FAR better suitors in the past!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Thank you son. You just made convincing her much easier.” Mr. Reynolds says and then suddenly touches your chest and you feel like your heart has a hot knife going into it. It might as well have because you feel like death is approaching you quickly as your body begins to seize up. You can’t even cry out. <EOS>
<BOS> You hear another knock on the door. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ey! Wat’s dis then? I may be just some dumb halfbreed hobgob, but I know damn well that shit is worth more!” Warts exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. Thanks. Told you I’d do it.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> The next day the ECS representative arrives. As mentioned in the correspondence to you, you meet in a “neutral” location at a tavern called the Bloody Bandit (Warts was right, why don’t more of these places have inviting names?) <EOS>
<BOS> “Marco, we’re getting the hell out of here. We’re also getting all of our people that we got posted at the docks, I got a better idea.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, we aren’t going to be here long hopefully. Let’s just try to get some rest.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I know, but you could stay, just for a little while. Let’s just enjoy what we have right here. Right now. Hey, we never watched the sunset together, why don’t we do that?” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? I’m not fucking her.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t do anything! There was a fight and Klint attacked me and then Annah stabbed him and then I stabbed him and…” <EOS>
<BOS> Part of you wonders if things really would have been different if you told Vera this before. Too late now you guess. <EOS>
<BOS> You end the story with a sigh, and hear the mage join you. He looks lost in thought. "Life loses it's sweetness with indolence," he mutters, "or, perhaps, hard work makes the simplest meal fit for kings." <EOS>
<BOS> “So basically what you’re saying is instead of you having to deal with independent slavers all the time, you want to just deal with us.” <EOS>
<BOS> You knock on the door and soon it opens and that’s when you see Yinen. <EOS>
<BOS> "Come with me," you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s going to be okay you know. I mean so far we’ve been making a lot of progress with little resistance so far. I mean I know there is the Jicol Coalition of Rogues that needs to be dealt with, but there are already whispers of some of them about to jump ship. If you’re worried about me, don’t be. I’ll be fine to do my job. If anything I’ll be safer by being closer to our headquarters since the slave shit is going to just be run from here directly and to the rebuilt docks. I won’t even have to travel to Jicol.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> Something is wrong, and it is imperative that you find out what. You hope there will be something with her, in the Grove of Muses, to explain what is happening or provide an answer. She had sacrificed herself to save the world, but at what cost? Why have dreams gone? Why do stories fade? And what is eating your very memories? <EOS>
<BOS> Prince Ragar strides through the castle hallways. His dark hair, tied at the back of his head, bounces with each step. Soldiers bring a fist to their heart as he passes by, and in return, Ragar gives a slight nod of appreciation, more in habit than actual gratitude. The news on his mind is most troubling, too troubling for him to give full attention to the guardsmen. <EOS>
<BOS> The plan is actually surprisingly simple. It’s just a basic break in with more attention on the security and locks. She says that she’s actually been casing the place on and off for a year and even acquired special dwarven thieving tools to help in her task. <EOS>
<BOS> "Would you like a cup of water?" she finally breaks the silence to offer, which you accept out of politeness. She grudgingly gives you a poorly washed cup half-filled. "It's Ronin's bedtime. I'd ask you not to keep him up; he needs his rest, poor child." <EOS>
<BOS> "So what are you saying? You saying you want to go with Vaughn's plan now?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? You embarrassed? You’re not THAT embarrassed if you’re still doing it. Besides, it’s not like you’d be the first, you just happen to be one of the few that’s been doing it the longest.” <EOS>
<BOS> “True. Still though. Not even Sneaks?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Can’t say I’ve seen that. Where did you say it was again?” <EOS>
<BOS> Form one! You move into action, performing the technique as best as one can do. Still, you identify areas to improve. Each time you flow through the forms, you see certain ways to progress. The work is never finished. <EOS>
<BOS> You lose your balance for a split-second and shakily bring your arms to a “T” shape to regain it. Realizing you’re broken from the meditative state, you remove the blindfold and hop down from the balancing beams. <EOS>
<BOS> It occurs to you how strange it is to be at the university at all. You never thought you’d ever “attend” your dad’s old place of higher learning. You’re sure at one time he had hopes you would, but it probably wasn’t under these circumstances. <EOS>
<BOS> Looking among their faces, you realize that they are your friends and acquaintances from the village; and it dawns on you that they are all dead. Then you see your own father, closing in on you amid the horde. Your heart sinks. What a tragedy. Who could do such a horrible thing to your village? <EOS>
<BOS> This asshole is trying to kill you! You’re not taking any chances. <EOS>
<BOS> Rook rips off his eye patch revealing a black gem which he then directs his attention to Tanya and blasts her with a beam of black energy. Halting her fireball attack for a moment. <EOS>
<BOS> “Here you go, but Hank you really need to start going easy on this shit. It’s getting a little harder to get. It’s almost as if the Klyton medical school is starting to realize their Numb supply is getting stolen.” You say giving Hank his fix. <EOS>
<BOS> You get no answer. <EOS>
<BOS> Worse, now you’re starting to visualize Vera’s death and it all comes to a head when you have very real nightmare involving you stabbing her to death. <EOS>
<BOS> "But the forest is huge. How does destroying things here help us find or destroy their base?" <EOS>
<BOS> Warts nods and heads off. Meanwhile you go see the innkeeper about something and he gets a large bag out of his icebox. <EOS>
<BOS> "Last time I saw him he was fine. Never said anything about being sick." Zalmora remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Nothing I suppose, but maybe I wouldn’t mind leaving Holgard if it didn’t feel like running. I mean I’ve spent so many years fighting the Ebony Claw, I’d hate to just hand the fucking city over to them. Yeah, I know it’s foolish, and maybe I’m just feeling the need to at least avenge the Guild considering I practically just destroyed it myself.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh it is. So out of the seven ships, you three are what’s left huh? Didn’t catch your names.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “So, am I just to be there as hired muscle?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ll go with you,” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “You got that one right too, school girl.” Zal says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well what do you want me to do? Swear to the gods? I mean I’ll swear to Fel if that will…” <EOS>
<BOS> “One might ask the same of someone who does nothing but remain invisible and bushwacks people from behind with a crossbow.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “SHIT! That’s Mr. Dream!” one of them exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t…ki…please…not…” he says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well okay, maybe stable wasn’t the right word, maybe DIFFERENT was more accurate. My point is, this is something I want to do and I can’t be a proper bard unless I travel and experience the world! I can’t stay here any longer.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I see your point, but I somewhat understand his logic for attempting to make an alliance. However he’s relying on something that I already told him isn’t going to make a difference.” <EOS>
<BOS> Heather’s people are holding their own, but the problem is the demons don’t stay dead or rather as soon as one is killed another one materializes. They can’t possibly keep this up forever. A little bit in the distance you also catch sight of a man in a shabby brown robe. You’re guessing this is the one summoning the demons. He must have some strong protection up, because demons aren’t known to enjoy being summoned by mortals. <EOS>
<BOS> “He’s not mean to me. He just talks to me. It’s just really dark and his voice is creepy and that’s scary. He says he wants to be my friend.” <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya is now looking at you in disbelief. <EOS>
<BOS> “Have you gone completely barmy? I wasn’t here that long while Scales was still around, but even I know damn well that the only reason why Ed even had control over that lizard is because he raised him from that egg! And you can see that didn’t work forever. You go looking for Scales and you’re going to find death!” Vaughn exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> “If it was, do you think we’d tell you? However, if you think you can handle the Syndicate all by yourself good luck. I’m sure if you haven’t caught their attention by now, you soon will. The ECS is fairly efficient that way. In any case, we’re reaching a hand out to you because we think you’d be an asset to the Guild. If you don’t like it, you can always leave the city entirely. That’s already better than the Claw. Once you join them, it’s for life.” Garrick remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “My problem…OUR problem with you is you fucking killed many of our friends and associates. Now you just walk in here like you think you own the place? You’re Guild scum, no you’re worse than Guild scum. You’re a fucking rat. You think if you sell out those assholes that’s going to make you good with us? Better think again. I don’t give a fuck what deal you made, you’re not coming in here demanding shit. If you got important information for Rook, he’ll contact you directly himself. YOU wait for him. Now I suggest you walk right back out that door and don’t come back unless you’re actually invited.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, I think it became a turning point in my reluctance to accept my heritage. I started to realize that I really should be embracing my potential not hiding from it. Something definitely changed that’s for sure, but I suppose not everything did.” <EOS>
<BOS> Was this all a set up, while Flynt took off to parts unknown? Flynt DID seem pretty willing to just hand off illegal drugs to you. Then again, why bother setting you up, when he could have just hid them somewhere rather than risk losing the product altogether? Maybe this is all just more bad luck hitting you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Join you?! I see you’ve been drinking too!” one laughs. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh these didn’t belong to them. These are mine. This house was either filled with broken furniture or garbage until I moved in. Apparently the government didn’t bother repurposing it or even seizing the property for housing someone else. Just left abandoned.” Yinen says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Any last words?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I bet you do.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> Again though, he seems familiar somehow. Even his voice is starting to remind you of someone you know. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ve tried several times to get into the thing while she wasn’t around, but no luck. I’m just not skilled at it like you are. I need an expert.” Annah says. <EOS>
<BOS> You slowly start to drift off as you feel Tanya rubbing against your body and almost wrapping herself around you like a second skin. She then whispers “I love you.” in your ear and makes some odd noises which aren’t exactly the most human sounding, however they do sound content, so at least there’s that. <EOS>
<BOS> “No! No! Fuck you, I’m not tellin’ you shit now. (hic) Who…who…what do you think I am some kinda asshole fer you to abuse? Callin’ me seventy fuckin’ years old. I oughta kick yer ass in the name of Joachim! Yer lucky I’m a man of faith…(hic)” <EOS>
<BOS> Ekk’a's thoughts always return to his rite of passage, even now, almost twenty years later. He spent most nights shivering in the cold, unable to start a fire due to the attention it brought. Several boys were sent out at the same time, and it wasn’t uncommon for infighting to occur. After all, a knife to the back is easier than tracking your own hunt. The thought brought a slight smile to his lips. Some of the others took the easy approach. Ekk’a didn’t, relying on his prowess as a hunter to survive. He was strong, born of a family of warriors. Taking the easy approach would be dishonorable to their tradition. <EOS>
<BOS> Then he slits your throat. <EOS>
<BOS> “Interesting. To be honest those Neroth worshipping assholes DO need to be dealt with. While some in the Ebony Claw don’t consider them top priority, I see them as a potential problem in the future. Especially since we’ve started to have our own run ins with them. Though I may be a bit biased considering they did kidnap my cousin once. Oh, by the way, always meant to thank you for rescuing her.” <EOS>
<BOS> "It's not just that though, we've got other people to think about. I mean the folks who aren't Talons aren't going to be a problem, like some of the waitresses. Even some of the Talons aren't going to be a problem. Hell, I can see someone like Vaughn being completely okay with this direction, but there are a few of the younger more ambitious members that aren't going to go along with this." <EOS>
<BOS> “So what’s this job pay then?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Leave whoever you want in charge. I’m suggesting that you completely abandon Holgard. I dunno, maybe make a deal with the Syndicate. Hand Holgard over to them as a one time pay off to not be taxed anymore. Our territory can be Jicol and they can have the rest. Seems like they might go for that.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Two years ago I guess. Didn’t know for an entire year either since I hadn’t been back ta visit Snuffit in awhile. Boy wuz she pissed at me when I returned. Anyway, he’s sort of with me for awhile since Snuffit says I should be spendin’ time him. She’s probably right. It’s hard growin’ up with no father.” Warts says with a bit of an introspective look down. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh not bigger than saving an entire organization from extinction I assure you. In any case, I know you’re obviously a man of great faith so I expect you to make this promise to Fel that you will help me whenever that day comes. Do this and I will take your word as true.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey! Stop that. I thought you guys were tame.” you say and brush away the bullying qweepas along with taking out the qweepa being attacked. The little creature runs up your arm and then perches on your shoulder and nuzzles up against you, almost as a sign that it thanks you for rescuing it. <EOS>
<BOS> You start to leave, but Tanya spins you around. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I am, but this still feels like recruitment.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Now if this is just too much for you, I’ll completely understand if you don’t want to work on this project anymore. I can find someone else.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> As Vera breaks down again into tears, you’re almost at a loss for words at this point. Your relationship with women has always been “complicated” but this is a new one on you. You never realized just how damn deep Vera’s feelings were for you and honestly it’s still a bit of a mystery to you. Especially given that she betrayed you. <EOS>
<BOS> A dark woman with glittering eyes reclines against one of the palms: Trasila, if you remember her name right. She used to travel the world seeking out rare artifacts and solving impossible riddles, but was taken in by the simple beauty of the oasis. You guess any suggestion she offers will be adventurous, or perhaps challenging. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t answer, but you don’t look convinced. <EOS>
<BOS> “Y’know, I wonder how effective of a killer you would be without that fancy pistol of yours.” A voice whispers. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, what’s wrong with you? You’re fidgeting and sweating. You keep putting your hand on your crotch…wait a minute. Did you have the drinks?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Okay I'm sensing something more is wrong than you just not being used to being sober." You say and then Vaughn breaks into the conversation. <EOS>
<BOS> But it will take a week to reach Stone City! You had counted on telling stories to fund the trip. <EOS>
<BOS> “Mama? No don’t hurt mama no more!” <EOS>
<BOS> “So, what are you going to be wearing?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Reginald said we need to get another sacrifice for the next ritual to Neroth. You know Reginald is very particular about these things.” A red robed individual says passing by. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course when you think of adventure, you also think of your sister who left home to deliberately seek it out. You often wonder what happened not just to her, but to your parents. It's odd to think that not only did you finally straighten your life out, but you're running the old family inn. Assuming they're still alive, you can't even tell them either, because as far as you know you're still wanted for murder in your home town. <EOS>
<BOS> You didn’t even see anyone around, but you don’t have much choice except to comply for now. When you get to the alley you’re met by a scarred looking man with an eye patch. <EOS>
<BOS> The next item is the humblest, but it does come with a signed note of authenticity. And since the brief description on the note didn't fade when you read it, you can assume it's to be trusted. The item is a hand-quilted saddle blanket, well-used, that once belonged to the famous horse Arion. Arion is the only horse who has ever won the cross-continental desert race, the Crimson Wave, more than once - he actually has three wins to his name, and according to the shopkeeper is this years favorite as well. The quilt is stamped with a hoof-print of Arion, and autographed with the signature of Little Pelmoral, his former jockey. It has a tag marked 500 that has been slashed through multiple times, until it now just reads 50. Apparently there isn't a very wide market for horse memorabilia. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shhhh! What the fuck are you doing!? You trying to get me…” <EOS>
<BOS> Vera doesn’t and instead leans in and bites your ear so hard she draws blood. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? I can’t do that, I got shit to run here. Who am I going to leave in charge? Warts?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I oughta just go meet this guy and stab him in the face like I did with Klint…” you mutter to yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> You sneak around a few buildings trying to stay away from the direction of the fighting and getting closer hoping the whole time nobody notices you. Eventually you go into a partially destroyed building and get to the third floor of it to take your shot since you figure you’ll at least be out of immediate danger of the demons suddenly turning around and attacking you. <EOS>
<BOS> First couple cages you pass are empty. The next one has a decaying smell as you pass, but nobody is in it. You notice on the other side of the road a couple of the cages have bodies in them, but seeing as they aren’t moving, you can only guess you’re probably walking by corpses. <EOS>
<BOS> Well you’ve bought yourself a little time, now you have to get started learning everything you can about this place and deciding on how to spend your time here. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, you could always gather the intelligence for us. Find out what caravans and wagons are leaving, which way they’re going, how well protected, all that stuff. Plus maybe you can start actively look for recruits.” <EOS>
<BOS> Suddenly you hear a loud blast and feel the piercing of a metal object hitting you in the back. You fall down in the filthy water and struggle to breathe, let alone get back up. <EOS>
<BOS> “Very good. Okay, so our deal for the medallion and a hundred gold for the book. It’ll take me some time to enchant the medallion so come back in an hour unless you want to wait.” <EOS>
<BOS> You might have less of a problem with releasing him if you could somehow confirm he is who he says he is. Tom certainly seems to know bits about your father that would be hard to know by some complete stranger. Your father never said anything about former childhood friends though, or if he did you weren’t paying attention. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you sure? Half of its face is blown off. Ugh.” Another remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure it’s shady and corrupt, but actually working for a government with a “real job” it’s a scenario ALMOST what your parents always wanted and at this point, why not? Might make a nice change of pace. <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course they knew! Did you really think you got away with it?” Percy says. <EOS>
<BOS> Talking to two Syndicate representatives isn’t exactly what you want to be doing right now, but this day was coming one way or another. <EOS>
<BOS> Your response is a bit of a surprise to Vaughn and a bigger surprise to Zalmora who both figured you'd ultimately want to take care of the problem directly. Vaughn however seems happy that his life won't be at risk now. Zal doesn't argue with your decision, but seems a little distracted by it. <EOS>
<BOS> You spend most of your work day tending to usual business. Still feels weird at times working a real job, but you're pretty much used to it now. Being with Zal certainly has made this transition easier for you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because the Felians DO know that we’re currently weak and they’ve already been conspiring to finish us off. Why they haven’t revealed such info to your organization I couldn’t say. Perhaps they felt that this didn’t concern you or you wouldn’t care. However, the shadow lurking fools are as you say, definitely not the order they once were. Even with our lesser strength we’ve already fought off several assassination attempts. Still, it’s only a matter of time before they DO ask for assistance and that’s most likely going to be you…or the Syndicate. They are back in this city are they not?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Fiction does that," you retort, knowing the reputation of the mages and holding to alternate history. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yep, completely barmy.” Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> You and your two people slowly head down the steps, when suddenly you start to hear squeaking. At first you think it might be rats, but the squeak is a bit of a lower tone. <EOS>
<BOS> And she did betray you. No matter what her twisted logic may dictate, you can’t forget that. <EOS>
<BOS> "Hold on, maybe you should send someone else. I mean maybe I could go take care of this." Zal says. <EOS>
<BOS> As tired as you are, the orc is fairly clumsy about swinging his branch at you so you manage to dodge. Obviously more used to fighting on horseback. <EOS>
<BOS> You manage to keep up this idiot charade for quite awhile completely exasperating the entire group to the point where several of them are calling you a retard and don’t know how the hell you’re even breathing, let alone getting in this university. <EOS>
<BOS> As far as any actual deeper feelings for Madeline…well you can always try and it isn’t like you don’t have a base to work from. <EOS>
<BOS> “I haven’t forgotten you and our deal, just so you know. I just haven’t made much progress on searching for a way to lift your curse. I did find Elder Flynn’s notes on the subject when you came in here, but honestly he was a little sketchy on the details concerning the curse part. Though I imagine once your ex was called in and bound, she would be able to be commanded to lift whatever curse she put on you. Still, he was probably more concerned with capturing a demon than curing you and after reading what would have happened to me, I’m even happier that you declined the ritual.” <EOS>
<BOS> But you don’t. In fact your mind has gone into a very dark place. You start seeing images of death. Not just hers though. You see the deaths of all the other women you had sex with since Tanya. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not surprised, most people don’t unless they’re really into the old text dedicated to Joachim. You familiar with him right?” <EOS>
<BOS> “What the fuck do you want?” one of them demands. <EOS>
<BOS> True, you two were never married and she did tell you to go live your life, but…well she IS a demon and who knows what the hell she’s like now. <EOS>
<BOS> However, since it is, you don’t say anything and just grab a chair in the room and exit. <EOS>
<BOS> Your first instinct is to fight, but you resist the urge to struggle. Wouldn’t do you any good anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t get far before you’re stopped by two teenagers. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, well I can have a room for you. Can’t do anything about the lingering smell I’m afraid, but then that’s part of why we’re trying to design a place not actually in the damn sewer.” <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re rummaging through, you find something you definitely didn’t put in there. A large black gem. Actually it’s a little sticky from blood on it, but this could only be from Rook’s eye socket. <EOS>
<BOS> You return to your room and as an added pre-caution, you put a chair against the door. You have no idea how you’re going to get a good night’s sleep for tomorrow, but you’re going to try… <EOS>
<BOS> "They're fine. I suppose this would be a good time to tell you, we got a new brother." <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, okay you’re not a woman to be messed with, got it. But I don’t see why I have to sleep on the floor when there are two beds.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright, alright, I see you want to get to celebrating again.” <EOS>
<BOS> You eventually get back up and decide you probably should be making your way back to Holgard, you can only imagine the shitstorm that’s going on there right now. Though you guess that Gwen will take the initiative and blame everything on Heather (Which is sort of true anyway; you didn’t expect that twist) and take over what’s left of the school. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, I have no idea what comes next. If I was smart I suppose I’d get out. Of course if I was smart, I wouldn’t be in this situation in the first place.” Tom says. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually the mayor says he’s heard enough and that’s when you think here comes the execution sentence. <EOS>
<BOS> Zal isn't the only one that's gotten older. True you're still relatively young in comparison and perhaps the roguish streak hasn't quite left you yet, but her transformation and everything else that's gone on...well quite frankly it is time to start thinking about a more stable future that doesn't involve criminal endeavors. <EOS>
<BOS> Captain Rifiv is using a telescope to look past the nearby mermaid infested waters in the hopes of finding some sort of land. Meanwhile most of the crew is busily filling their own ears with wax. <EOS>
<BOS> “You can put that away, it’s just me. Glad to see you’re more alert than you appear though.” Tanya says when you spin around pointing your pistol at her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Gotta say though when Sneaks ran away all those years ago, I never expected it was to Jicol.” <EOS>
<BOS> One month later... <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh and call me a whore too. I want to imagine you’re raping me in this alley. Y’know like when you pretend threaten to do when we first met?” <EOS>
<BOS> Somehow you actually manage to get your head above water and you open your eyes just long enough to see the faintest sign of land in the distance. <EOS>
<BOS> You smash the window and try to break the remaining side pieces so you don’t get cut up too badly, but by this time your actions have already drawn the attention of Jenny and apparently her very large gentleman caller. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe…but probably not. For whatever reason the Ebony Claw Syndicate has not fucked with us. If we start going into their territory, that could change. However I was thinking we could physically expand where isn’t a strong organized criminal presence.” <EOS>
<BOS> The ride leaves tomorrow and you need to be on it so you need to get your rest. You spend the rest of the day and night packing everything you plan on taking, because if all goes to plan, you won’t be coming back. <EOS>
<BOS> “Let me guess, everyone got all friendly?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m saying I’m getting out. I’m leaving town.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey! I’m not nervous! There’s four of us out here and just one of you!” Marco exclaims, not knowing just how close he is to death at anytime. <EOS>
<BOS> "Ha ha ha ha! He's just joking...he..." <EOS>
<BOS> "What would I be doing exactly?" <EOS>
<BOS> "Nice save. Okay, have it your way." Zal remarks and takes her leave before you start yelling at her. Vaughn not wishing to be your second choice for verbal abuse takes his leave as well. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t fucking believe this…she fucking robbed me? Bitch!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “Listen up, because I’m only saying this once! Maybe Garrick thinks you’re an asset to the Guild, but I’m not convinced. You better show me something better than the pitiful displays you’ve shown since you got here.” She says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Lots you don't know about me, but I wouldn't exactly say Grahk and I are in a relationship, we just had a bit of fun together. In fact I haven't seen him in years. I just know he still goes to that bakery since Stovo has mentioned him a few times when I go in there." <EOS>
<BOS> Still, your numbers still aren’t overwhelming enough to make the potential victory to not be costly. This isn’t even counting the small fortress that the mayor of Jicol never leaves which again isn’t a problem to get into, but who know what the hell is in store for you inside. <EOS>
<BOS> Two weeks later... <EOS>
<BOS> "What do you think?" Pelomin clicks his horse to move faster. "Worth every coin, right?" <EOS>
<BOS> I imagined my arrival to the monastery to be a result of loving parents wanting a better life for me. It was a good lie to believe at a young age. The monks accepted me, even though I was much older than an infant. That fact alone made me different from my peers and hurled me straight to the bottom of the hierarchy. The lie I told myself about my parents was one of the things that kept me going. <EOS>
<BOS> “It doesn’t even fucking matter if you did or not. My point is, she’s letting a damn stranger live with her before ME! That just shits all over our relationship as far as I’m concerned! And another thing…” <EOS>
<BOS> You continue working on the lock while only really half listening to Tom’s ramblings about your father. <EOS>
<BOS> ‘Hello?” you say in order to get their attention. The robed individual looks up and you see it’s a woman. She puts her books aside to address you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Please! No, don’t kill me!” he whimpers pathetically. <EOS>
<BOS> “Get out of here, you don’t mean that…” <EOS>
<BOS> "Do you greet all your potential customers that way?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> The fact that you have to fuck one of Flynn’s disciples for this is already enough to raise an eyebrow from you, but even if this is all on the level and Flynn is being completely truthful, you can’t bring yourself to do this only for Tanya to be enslaved to this asshole. <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile Annah realizes what you’re doing and manages to easily pick everyone’s pockets while they’re focused on you. She then takes off with her dog. <EOS>
<BOS> By this time however, Tom has gained complete control over the situation and everyone else who was rebelling have stopped doing whatever they were doing and stepped back. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t have a class for a couple days. I’m good until then.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Garrick, look, she isn’t exactly tripping over herself for me either despite me revealing all this information. If anything she probably dislikes me even more now. She’s not worth dying for so you want me gone, fine, I’m going. And if it will suffice, my apologies.” You say and start backing away with your hands up. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 21 <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Virgil mumbles and stumbles away, bumps into the door to his room and then after a few tries he finally gets it open and slams it behind him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Neither is Marco apparently from what you mentioned on his attempt to be a pirate.” <EOS>
<BOS> The people here do not seem to be the shouting type, so you glance around you for inspiration. The setting makes you think of exotic tales and impossibly beautiful places. Perhaps an ancient hanging garden, and a princess, would suit the sensibilities of these richer folks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Fine, so convince me. That is what you've always been good at isn't it?" You remark and sit down. <EOS>
<BOS> Not that you have some great love for the Felians, and you don’t even mind Heather, but who knows what the hell her real agenda is if she’s making friends in high places. Plus better the devil you know than the one you don’t. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I knew, and I have it here. Just a poor attempt at a joke I suppose.” <EOS>
<BOS> The job that you and Sneaks are to perform doesn’t sound all that difficult, which is just as well since you’re still having problems focusing. When he asks if you have any questions, you just have one and that’s what’s the name of the hooded woman who spoke to you yesterday. <EOS>
<BOS> From there you return to The Lighthouse where you get some rest for tomorrow. Tanya isn’t around though, but maybe she really wants to keep a low profile now. <EOS>
<BOS> There doesn’t even seem to be any “divine magic” either or religion as you know it anyway. The citizens of the Empire all seem to worship the current Emperor as a “living god.” (The body just being a vessel for him until he discards it for a new one) <EOS>
<BOS> “Say Hank, what would you say if I told you I could find some actual talent to grace that stage of yours that might drum up more business?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Are their no pirates docked in our harbor?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Everyone, prepare for an ambush!” you say and you all form a circle expecting goblins to pop up out of secret compartments in the floor and walls. <EOS>
<BOS> “If it hadn’t been for me, you wouldn’t have come here.” <EOS>
<BOS> The meeting isn’t very long. The magistrate just asks you some general questions about yourself and how you came to be in the situation where you were fighting an orc in the first place. You give him the same story you told Keira and he seems to accept that as a suitable explanation. He doesn’t even ask why you were going to Arcanius. The man just seems to be fulfilling the basics of his duties. <EOS>
<BOS> Well that was way more productive than asking Virgil. It’s all a little sinister now that you have a little more information though. Why the hell wouldn’t a simple courier just meet you at the inn you’re staying at? You suppose it’s possible he doesn’t know, but if he’s already spoken to Randi or Virgil, one of them has no doubt blabbed already. At least Randi probably did. <EOS>
<BOS> You scramble away and manage to get back up, but one of the thugs is already upon you. The whole time slack jawed gawkers either just watch in silence or they run off not wishing to be caught up in this. <EOS>
<BOS> You take advantage by elbowing Klint in the back of the head. He staggers and falls to the ground again where you proceed to kick him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Should we really start second guessing ourselves? I mean wasn’t the whole plan to learn this information and act on it?” <EOS>
<BOS> Adding more lies is only going to trip you up on details if further questioned. Better to stick with the same story. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually enough time passes and you start feeling tired or at least bored enough that you’d rather be doing something else. You briefly think about finding another place to stay or even going to the Sultry Siren like the driver suggested, but you really don’t feel like dealing with the stairs again or spending your money. You then wonder if maybe you shouldn’t take this opportunity to break into some of the other rooms. <EOS>
<BOS> During this time you’re also mainly avoiding the Bloody Talons (along with the Klyton Militia) who are a little more aware of you now thanks to that night Annah mouthed off to them. Fucking Annah… <EOS>
<BOS> “Why are you even going on this task? You said you had people in Jicol located at the docks to make sure he didn’t try to get away and there are more than enough people to attack where the JCR are making their headquarters.” <EOS>
<BOS> The shop closes and you go back to the Welcome Mat (and shoving Virgil aside when he predictably asks you for coin as usual). <EOS>
<BOS> During one of those moments, you both look deep into each other’s eyes and you finally move in to kiss. From there, you both do what lovers tend to do. <EOS>
<BOS> "Good. What happened to your face? Did Vaughn do that?" <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, there are also other areas some of your more enterprising members have been trying to convince you of expanding into. <EOS>
<BOS> You drop your weapon and collapse. You almost feel like all the energy has been drained out of you. You’re so weak, you can hardly even push yourself back up, though a hefty kick soon stops that attempt. <EOS>
<BOS> You try to think of the most unattractive and least erotic things you can think of like the Holgard sewers, and similar things. You also hit yourself in crotch a few times and unlike the masochist freaks, that works to lessen your arousal. Doesn’t get rid of it entirely though and you’re not doing that too much more because it hurts like a sonofabitch. <EOS>
<BOS> "They're fine. I suppose this would be a good time to tell you, we got a new brother." <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose, but at the rate shit is going down here, we might not even be able to pay the pittance that the ECS asks for every month.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya, it’s not what it seems! I’m…I’m…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sneaking around? But I’m going through the main gate!” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good thing it’s dark, otherwise this’d be a terrifying view,” someone beside you comments. The wind takes most of his words away from you. You find it’s not a difficult climb as long as you preserve your energy. Not knowing how far you needed to go is reason enough to save your strength. The unknown enemy below only adds to it. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re done. <EOS>
<BOS> No sooner has Gloom made his announcement, a white light washes over the room and suddenly all of Gloom’s previously shadow cloaked people are now visible. Naturally Gloom just assumes this is just the effects of the orb, but he’s soon very surprised to learn that the Dornans have not lost any of their magic abilities at all. <EOS>
<BOS> The third item is the largest - massively large, an opulent derby hat in tiers of tulle and cascading maroon ribbons, complete with a model of three horses in a winner's circle, the first place horse being one of the Empress's own according to the proprietor. His daughter was commissioned to make the hat by a duchess, and was paid half up front, but in the end the lady decided not to go to the planned event celebrating the horse's win, not to pick up the hat, and not to make the final payment. It's marked down to 45 silver, in hopes of covering the rest of the cost of the materials. <EOS>
<BOS> "The serpent, of course," he says, "for it's the most cunning of all creatures." <EOS>
<BOS> "I guess so...sheesh...do you think they'd even want to see me?" <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re watching the soldiers go about their jobs (And your guards doing more talking with each other than actually watching you) Mr. Scars finally says something to you. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 17 <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, ‘The Oblitterum Nomeno.’ It’s the book of the damned. It contains the souls of all those whom the Gods have blotted out of their Books of Life. For a necromancer to possess it is a dire proposition indeed. With it, Mad Merodatch can not only destroy entire villages and raise the dead as undead – but he can also transfer the life force from one being to another; to the point of resurrecting anything once dead and making it his dependent thrall!” <EOS>
<BOS> Which is sort of a problem now that Tanya has decided that it’s time to actually take out the Ebony Claw leadership for good. Arguably, she probably could have wiped out the Ebony Claw Syndicate with your help (Or at least this increasingly smaller chapter of it) months ago. But she got so distracted with enjoying the bedlam, that it allowed Rook to fortify like he has. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, well you know what I say bout all dose people dat died…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well rich kids with coin to waste like to drink so it’s worth it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Good, here’s the book, the list of the various ingredients I’ll be needing is in it.” <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile all you’ve done is stand up and drawn your pistol. <EOS>
<BOS> When you get back to Keira’s home, you find that she’s home. <EOS>
<BOS> This living day to day without thinking about the future was okay before, but now you’re starting realize that maybe you should be rethinking your simplistic approach to life. Because even if you’re still a good enough thief to evade the law and trouble most of the time, you’re getting a little bored of doing it. Something different might be in order. <EOS>
<BOS> “None that matter. And if you meant Zamed, I’m pretty sure he’s not going to object since I heard he died pissing off the Governor of Hessla months ago. Not like I’d seen him since we went with your idea to side with Ludmilla anyway. Seems like it was the right choice given the circumstances.” <EOS>
<BOS> A couple weeks pass and sure enough, you haven’t been harassed by the Holgard Watch (Well within reason). <EOS>
<BOS> I suppose you’re wondering if I planned all this out, well no not initially. I really was getting ready to move on with my life and leave the city, but running into just presented an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. Sweet revenge. Revenge that I kept toying with for years and finally had the guts to go through with. <EOS>
<BOS> And it feels sooooooo good. <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sigh) I know it might seem really weird, but I’m just not THAT much of a bastard yet.” <EOS>
<BOS> If Scales is killing people just for trespassing, you don’t fancy your chances. At least with this ogre you’re not going to get killed just for showing up. (You hope) <EOS>
<BOS> "FISH BITCHES! WAX! WAX! WAX! DON'T LOOK AT THE WATER!" He shouts nearly falling over in the process. <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well. Also, and I feel I need to stress this again, when your succubus appears, it is vital that you DO NOT LISTEN to ANYTHING she has to say! In fact, you should just get the hell out of the room as soon as possible. You can wait elsewhere in the temple while we finish binding the demon.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, but that tart and her friends spread the word about your deeds a long time ago. I’m more surprised they you weren’t targeted sooner by them.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Not your concern," Captain Brost says, glaring, "but you did fix him up. Enough, anyway. Which is good for you. If he'd died, or if he dies before we dock in an hour, you'll become a liability and not an asset. Understand?" <EOS>
<BOS> You're exhausted and pale, but you've finally arrived in Pefallis. <EOS>
<BOS> "It isn't so simple," the officer flushes, "as you all paid for a shared room." <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Madeline gloms on to you and unsuccessfully tries not to cry. She’s holding on you like you’re life itself, which is funny considering you just said you weren’t sure if you going to kill her or not. <EOS>
<BOS> “Has it been three hours yet?” <EOS>
<BOS> “In any case, the fucker said he was carrying an important message for you from your family and that it’s very urgent that you meet him at the Raggedy Man Inn.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh? And just how exactly are you going to support yourself?” <EOS>
<BOS> Though dark, the sound of the blades traveling through the air kicks your instincts into gear. You instantly step backward, ducking and covering your face. The twin swords swing just above your head, sending a rush of air to your face. <EOS>
<BOS> “Honestly, sometimes I wonder, but I guess I shouldn’t talk like that. Shit, I can’t believe that you…well I’ll definitely inform Garrick. I can’t say if this is going to get you into the Guild lair itself, but it probably will make Garrick look favorably upon you. Just stay in this inn for a while, , all your food and drink will be taken care of. Someone more important than me will contact you. Here, take your bullets and kit while you’re at it.” <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually the tunnel stops sloping and evens out. You walk a little more and already in the dim light you can see the room ahead is going to be bigger than you thought. <EOS>
<BOS> “My right hand isn’t entirely convinced of your potential and so wanted to keep directions to our current location secret. He’s a bit of a hard sell, however let’s get on with it. You said you had important information about the Guild yes?” Rook asks. <EOS>
<BOS> As you check his bandages yet again, you feel a strange warmth uncurl from inside you and seep out of your hands into Elzu. A gift from Ivani, somehow? Or simply your imagination? <EOS>
<BOS> "Very well then. Here is the tale of the Curious Soldier." <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh? Oh that? I suppose so. Honestly though, haven’t had any problems in all the years I’ve driven this route. Still, I keep it loaded just in case.” The driver replies. <EOS>
<BOS> "Story-hour is now closed," they announce to the group to a chorus of awws. A few of the parents pass you a bit more coin as they leave. <EOS>
<BOS> “Far to the south and west.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Thank you warm blood, but can’t let you leave. Might bring othersss. If dead, people continue to ssstay away. Need peace.” You hear a reptilian voice hiss and then a set of jaws go to for your throat. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hold on! Hold on! I’m not here to do anything sinister! I’m the director of Holgard security and I’m here about a curse. I have one on me. I sent two letters to this place and my agent gave them both to your people. I was told you agreed to meet me and could help.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh? And how exactly did we fail you your majesty?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh shut up! This shouldn’t even be a surprise to you, never liked you anyway. I’m tired of looking and feeling like an old bat while I’m only in my thirties!” Give me this woman’s youth and then you may return to your own realm.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Pfft, not that free. I’m paying half of everything everyday.” <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sigh) Do you have anything to say in your defense?” he asks. <EOS>
<BOS> "What?! They wouldn't hire me and I can't compete with the bitches that hoity toity place! They're all twenty years younger, got all their teeth, magically enhanced tits, and don't have a rash on their..." <EOS>
<BOS> It might seem to be the less traditional choice of the three, but not having to pay her is a big plus. You just hope she’s actually as intelligent as Camid claims. <EOS>
<BOS> You and Heather start to discuss each other’s plans. Your situation with Percy is easy enough Heather says, and assures you that she will be able to implement something with the help of her people. <EOS>
<BOS> "I dunno, I just think we're extorting too many businesses within a short period of time. I mean have you forgotten that the Klyton militia is still pretty active?" <EOS>
<BOS> Since you need to put as much distance between you and Klyton, you catch a carriage ride out to the infamous town. The trip to Hessla is surprisingly uneventful. <EOS>
<BOS> They won’t be the only one. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well - I suppose I can say this. Have you heard the edict against public storytelling?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Tom says he wants me here. Says you’d be better for the job seeing as you have a past with Jake and how he hates me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Our time together wasn’t long enough.” She says with sadness. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s been a long couple of days and right now all you want to do is head back to the Welcome Mat and your room. When you get there, you’re immediately accosted by Virgil who is surprisingly less drunk than usual. Must be a slow day. <EOS>
<BOS> "You ladies can fuck anyone you want, but if you're going to be doing it here, you better be doing it for fun rather than profit. There is to be no more whoring here. If you want to pursue that line of work, you do it elsewhere. Better yet, the Klyton Kitty is hiring right now. You ladies could go there and be completely legal prostitutes at that establishment." <EOS>
<BOS> Even with wax in your ears you can still hear the nearby gunshot of an enchanted crew member shooting one of his fellows. <EOS>
<BOS> “…oh well I guess you’re telling me to my face at least. Alright out with it.” <EOS>
<BOS> For at least the next hour, you search the house disarming traps and uncovering secret doors. You don’t find anyone though. Meanwhile the Jicol Watch is still standing in the front room getting impatient. <EOS>
<BOS> You return to Camid with your decision who is incredibly surprised that you listened to him. <EOS>
<BOS> You wish you had listened to Zalmora. <EOS>
<BOS> Somehow you manage to find yourself in what you think must be an office area since you see various doors with names on them. (All of them with “Dr.” in front) As you’re passing one, the door opens and you find yourself face to face with an older woman with gray hair. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I trust you know just about all you need to. Remember, that package is very important, so guard it carefully. Though I don’t expect that you’re going to have any problems, Delantium’s military definitely makes sure bandits and the like are less of a threat, especially on the roads.” Flynt remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re not with the Empire,” he states, part questioningly. <EOS>
<BOS> When you get back home, you explain what happened, though Vera is just pleased to see you and says she’s doesn’t know why she worried in the first place. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah! Yes! That’s where you looked familiar. I loaned your grandfather money which your father ended up paying off. Well, this is a nice coincidence, or perhaps fate?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay look, I’m not stealing your woman. She’s just letting me stay here until I recover. In fact I should be leaving by tomorrow.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Great, it’s getting fucking dark now. If you think you’re going to…” you start to say. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point you dump out the contents of the bag and bloody heads drop out. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure. Might as well have a clean slate.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait…you’re saying the boss is ALSO dead?!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Start talking then bitch.” <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Vera begins lifting her dress up and grinding herself into you. <EOS>
<BOS> You take several side streets and even backtrack a few times, before you eventually just go down one of the sewer openings in the hopes of hiding for a while. <EOS>
<BOS> True they could be playing it close to the vest, but you think you would have gotten at least something by now. Either the Syndicate is just making you sweat or they’ve decided it wouldn’t be worth their time or resources in going to war with you. <EOS>
<BOS> “SHUT UP! SHUT UP!” Garrick suddenly shouts and lunges at you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well I think even mom has her limits. Besides, neither one may have a choice in protecting us, if we really fuck up one day.” <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t get far from the dorm when security shows up. Any other time security isn’t a problem around here, but when several women are screaming rapist they come heavy. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I never said the Dreams were snitches, I said they were loudmouth assholes that blabbed so much they let a Neroth spy catch wind of all our operations so they could fuck them up. And as for you lot ripping off the Syndicate, well why the hell else would this chapter be hemorrhaging coin as you put it? I work at that Blue Dream House and I know damn well we make more than THIS.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm glad to see that wisdom has come with your age. That's good. Last time our business together was less than cordial. That's okay though, I still got paid. As I said, I would love to help you again in this matter, but I'm afraid, this isn't my call this time. Last time when Henry worked for you, you insulted his work and I'm afraid, my son takes things a bit more personal than I do. He won't work for you again." <EOS>
<BOS> Over the course of the next three days you make visits to Reginald’s home and spend hours watching the place. You never see anyone come in or out of the place though. Indeed, you’ve never seen Reginald at all except from descriptions of him. Holgard Watch patrols the grounds night and day, but you don’t see them ever enter the home either. You wonder if they even know what’s going on in there or more likely they do, but don’t care. <EOS>
<BOS> As you wander, torn where to go, the haunting refrain of Willow's call resonates once again. The stirring sorrow finds an aching place to rest inside your own chest, and you take the hand of the despairing muse. <EOS>
<BOS> “You have no idea of what I’m capable of Sneaks. Honestly, I wouldn’t even rank slave trading as the worst thing I’ve ever done. But since you’re pointing the finger and moralizing like a Joachimite priest, let’s turn this back on you for a moment. The day before I helped wipe out the Thieves Guild, YOU were gone. You must have already known the shit was going to get hot really quick and you turned tail and fled. You talk about how I betrayed everyone, but what about you? I was only a member for a few years and not even liked by Garrick. Why the fuck would I stay loyal? Tanya? She was a demonkin, you know demons can’t be trusted. YOU were supposed to be Garrick’s best friend and dedicated to his organization. Where the fuck were YOU?” <EOS>
<BOS> The laughing subsides within your mind, allowing your vision to come back. Seth’s hand waves in front of you searching for some sign of life. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 23 <EOS>
<BOS> Against your better judgment (or any judgment really) you finally give what Vera’s always wanted from you. <EOS>
<BOS> Fortunately, Pefallis is a huge - more than a town or mere city, it is a sprawling metropolis with no end in sight, as if five or six towns had just decided to fuse together. Unfortunately, it's massively crowded, and you aren't sure where anything is. You decide to follow the largest mass of people leaving the docks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Ivani?!" You clasp her stony hand. "Are you there, somewhere, inside? Should I have come before this?" <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe this is a foolish decision, but you have to try. The more you think about having to spend twenty years in a prison the more you know you aren’t going to be able to handle it. <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose I would. However, I’m still reluctant to leave Holgard.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Split up?” <EOS>
<BOS> “And you trust this pirate?” <EOS>
<BOS> In another couple hours, a runner comes to you with news that your people have opened the gates and fighting is going on all over the city. Marco and his crew successfully entered the harbor and managed to fool the Jicol Watch long enough to break through, meanwhile Zamed’s force has drawn away most of the Jicol ships, which are now fighting, in the open sea. <EOS>
<BOS> “Didn’t seem like it when you had your tongue in my mouth and your hand on my ass a few moments ago.” Madeline says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wow, really taking your new job seriously huh? Well in any case I don’t have any preference on where to go, so whatever you decide, we can do that.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you arrive, you see the place is still the same shithole it’s always been, though it probably isn’t much worse than the Laughing Devil at this point. Thankfully Trobart isn’t around to give you any shit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, Ponyride is ready to see you.” He says which causes a bit of confusion from your cellmate who probably didn’t expect you to have such connections. You get the impression his attitude towards you will be a lot different when you return. <EOS>
<BOS> “Watch yer, fuckin’ tongue! One word from me, and the militia would take your ass in quick!” <EOS>
<BOS> A week passes and there still isn’t any word from Zal. No word from Jake or anyone from the Bloody Smiles either. <EOS>
<BOS> "...AND HER ASS TASTES LIKE MOLASSES AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS MIGHTY FINE! SECOND VERSE! OHHHHHHHH..." <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah. We took both of their bodies to the usual spot if you wanted to say a few things to David…” <EOS>
<BOS> You have enough problems on land, no need to add being surrounded by water as one of them. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, it can’t be,” he whispers. <EOS>
<BOS> “While I guess he could be more willing to listen with his fuck buddy there, but aren’t YOU her fuck buddy now? Not really a secret, and far be it from me to question your taste in women, but I’m not sure if Jake is going to be exactly pleased to see you anyway, let alone if you’re with his former squeeze.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh, wha?” Hank sputters while waking up and drooling on himself. <EOS>
<BOS> “Magic is a bitch to the aging process apparently.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I make it a point of knowing all my guests as they arrive. Not to mention your clothing isn’t exactly shall we say refined enough. While I’m sure you thought it was very upscale looking, but the workmanship is obviously from one of the mediocre tailors in the city. Only a crimelord with no care for such extravagant airs would believe it to be sufficient for this party. Not to worry though, I will not hold it against you. You tried.” <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t have too much time to celebrate however since the other orc hasn’t given up on ranged attacks and throws his last javelin at you. On the plus side it doesn’t hit you. The bad news is it hits the horse causing it to flail and causing you to also lose balance and go over the side of the bridge! <EOS>
<BOS> “The Welcome Mat is a shitty place I agree, but we’re less likely to draw attention there. I mean we’re a young couple with no visible means of support. Granted the asshole who runs the place is always bitching about his rent, but given that he’s selling booze without a license in his basement and got whores living in his hotel he’s not likely to turn us in. I mean there is also the militia to worry about and it feels like they’ve been increasing their own patrols in response to the Bloody Talons.” <EOS>
<BOS> As much as your current situation isn’t exactly the most ideal, you’re not really ready to just cut and run just yet. Not to mention you doubt if the Syndicate is going to just let you walk away even if you offered them Holgard. It’s like they say, you can’t just walk away from this life unless you’re planning on going into hiding in a far away land. <EOS>
<BOS> “Something with booze!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Vaguely. Some sort of moneylender with connections in high places so the militia doesn’t fuck with him. Actually, I think I remember my mother telling me my father’s family was in debt to him at one point.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh come on, let me satisfy your other appetites. I’ll even give you a discount for your broken heart.” Randi says thrusting her chest out and moving in closer to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Really? Huh, didn’t know that. Well anyway, compliant frightened slave girl or not, I’m wary about this.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Lyin that you WEREN’T tryin ta rape her? Pfft, already know that son.” <EOS>
<BOS> Kol tells you that he asked Fel about being taken away by Fel’s agents, to which he asked further questions if he was sure that was what he wanted and why. Kol tells you he didn’t really know how to answer other than “I don’t know” <EOS>
<BOS> After waiting a bit, you leave your hiding spot and make your way back even quicker than before. Even Warts isn’t complaining anymore and is focused on escape. <EOS>
<BOS> “But you said you send the students on field assignments.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Alright fine, I'll stop being a downer. I just want you to be more careful. I mean I didn't notice it immediately, but you've got some blood on your clothing and even your hands. I certainly hope you were careful about being seen." <EOS>
<BOS> It’s time to be free, no matter what the cost. <EOS>
<BOS> “Where are you going to go?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course you prefer a more grounded approach so as soon as it looks safe, you simply run up to the front door and pick the lock, which is a lot easier than you thought it would be. <EOS>
<BOS> The ECS may not have gotten the most hurtful revenge on you, but they didn’t exactly fail. You can’t even be mad at them. Maybe in some weird way this is finally all your good luck crapping out on you. You have done a lot of treacherous shit yourself after all. <EOS>
<BOS> "WHAT?!" You exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why is it that I always find you injured?” you say trying to lighten the mood. “You’re getting slow in your old age.” <EOS>
<BOS> You really know how to pick ‘em. You went from a demonkin who tried to turn you away at every opportunity to a woman who practically adores you so much that she gets off on you “raping” her. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 25 <EOS>
<BOS> And as fucked up as that all sounds, it’s actually helping in keeping you in the mood and making you more enthusiastic. (The combo of going this long without sex and under these circumstances you think have really warped you) <EOS>
<BOS> After having to kill a few of them, you find remnants of one of the League’s camps which display signs of battle what with the bloody bodies of your people lying around. It’s apparent that the Watch isn’t bothering to take prisoners. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’d take that as an insult if I actually thought you knew what you were questioning. However, yes I am quite sure.” <EOS>
<BOS> You soon manage to control the horse (which is anxious to get away from the chaos anyway) and gallop away until the skirmish is far behind you and you’re basically left alone again. Unfortunately your horse suddenly starts wheeze and wobble. You manage to hastily get off before it collapses. <EOS>
<BOS> Ultimately, he’s either telling the truth about the forest being that treacherous or he’s completely bullshitting you. You’ll just have to decide for yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well it certainly is a legacy to be proud of. Slave trading …even that’s something I wouldn’t have thought you capable of. Then again you already proved to be a traitor without any honor so I guess it isn’t too surprising.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh I go by Dr. Gossey and nowadays I focus purely on zoology and the biology of the creatures and animals that live in our fascinating world! So are you a student here too and trying to follow in your dad’s footsteps?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I guess we’ll go together then. Not like I can think of anyone else to take anyway. Says it’ll be in three days so I suggest you prepare yourself.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> "There may be, but I do not know it.  Her voice in your head grows fainter, and you strain to focus on her last words: "I'm sorry, the power within me is fading. I love you, time has not changed that. But I need you to think beyond me. You are the one chosen by the One God for this task, not I. Go where you are called, do what you must do, and my love will always be with you." <EOS>
<BOS> You recover just in time to see Klint hovering near her body with his knife in it. She’s lying up against the door of Jasmine’s shop as blood seeps out and dyes her clothing red. <EOS>
<BOS> “We have! Um, we’ve managed to save couple of our brothels from getting too fucked up. We’ve also been having people take the whores back to headquarters and stay there until it’s safe.” <EOS>
<BOS> The crumbling castle as your destination, with your band of freedom fighters, you head to confront the shaman and strike a deadly blow to the Empire. <EOS>
<BOS> “It typically is, which is why you can see how much trouble we’re in if people can just up and quit! It didn’t really help when the Ebony Claw Syndicate showed up here briefly.” <EOS>
<BOS> You hold Kol close who doesn’t know quite what’s going on and to your surprise… <EOS>
<BOS> “Heeeeey youngster! (hic!) You got any spare….coppers fer the faith?” Virgil asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You still don’t know how she knew about some of that stuff, but you’re eager to see her prove herself. <EOS>
<BOS> You spin, using the momentum of your body to power your heel kick, finishing the movement with a jumping overhead swing. Sweat drips from your forehead, creating a small mud puddle at your feet. Taking a sip from your waterskin, you take another deep breath of morning air. It’s cloudy, but you can tell the sun will soon burn through, transitioning the sky into a bright blue. You’ve not yet reached your destination, but damn if you won’t enjoy the journey along the way. <EOS>
<BOS> “We aren’t, this will all be voluntary. Plenty of stupid assholes that are willing to try to prove they’re tough for a bit of coin. If they get themselves killed, well that’s on them and either way, we don’t need to worry about keeping anyone in good condition, unless we’re fixing a particular fight. Hell, we could also use people that are falling behind in their debts to participate rather than breaking their legs. So no slaves needed.” <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t know how much time you have or even if it’s going to matter, but you still feel compelled to help in some way. Maybe she isn’t the Tanya that you fell in love with anymore, but for better or worse, you’re going to help her whether that means directly or indirectly. <EOS>
<BOS> “You familiar with Sotakians?” Tom asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well…if we DID go this route, and I’m not saying we are. I know a few outside folks that might be able to do it without problems. Damn, I just wish there was a less messy way of handling this.” <EOS>
<BOS> You tense up slightly when you see him do this, but nothing happens. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not going to this meeting, however since you’re so friendly with this Zamed and he’s going anyway, you can continue to accompany him. Then you can come back here and tell me what you think.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> "One of the bums that participates in the fights." <EOS>
<BOS> “Dark forces? What, as opposed to the dark forces under the Baron’s control?” <EOS>
<BOS> In the meantime, you need to get the Yellow Devil Den running at full capacity again. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t wait too long before you put your plan into action. Also doesn’t take long before the Joachimites are on the defensive. Your first few attacks are particularly devastating to their ranks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I hope I can impress you in the future since now that I have laid eyes upon your lovely face, I can definitely say that it has not been a displeasure.” <EOS>
<BOS> A lot of them haven’t done much except steal or perform sexual favors. A couple of them have killed, but none catch your attention until one of them starts accusing another one of having sex with children. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s my boy. We’re in the process of abolishing the Empire, giving freedom back to each territory. With the Emperor’s death, the remaining army should fall apart. We might have a few warlords, Imperial commanders trying to assume leadership, but they will be dealt with.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s a port town west of Hessla and from what I’ve heard it’s wide open like a whore’s legs. Nobody has tried to organize anything there and the city focuses so much on defending against potential pirate attacks that it doesn’t have the heightened security like say Klyton does in recent years. I say we start there.” <EOS>
<BOS> After her story ends, she starts to pack up her things, collecting her meager tips. A few others drop more coin in her hat, a respectable 25 silver, and you surmise that these children and parents were ones who had stayed for many stories - perhaps the whole day - and had yet to give. <EOS>
<BOS> The translucent weapons tear through the back of Seth’s heels, sending him sprawling to the floor. Seth's pair of blades fly from grasp, sliding just out of reach from his outstretched hands. He turns to your approaching footsteps. He starts to say something, but slow piercing from the translucent sword point turns his words into a soft gurgle. Immediately, the Unbroken covers the wound with dark magic. <EOS>
<BOS> Once again Warts leads the way and you follow. <EOS>
<BOS> Unbelievable. <EOS>
<BOS> Okay. She was pretty quick to change the subject… <EOS>
<BOS> Peter Varsakken’s invasion has been going on for a few weeks now, and so far the he’s succeeded in is destroying Ludmilla’s fleet and Holgard’s docks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Is this what this is about? I’ve never even fucked Vera and never made a move on her!” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> You still feel a bit weird about all this, but honestly with as much pain you’re in right now, you really aren’t thinking about Keira in that way. (Well at least not immediately) <EOS>
<BOS> Percy pats your hand from across the table in his enthusiasm. Honestly, you don’t know if the guy is flirting with you at this point. Maybe it’s a tactic to try to make you uncomfortable, whatever it is, you stay stoic. <EOS>
<BOS> “Agreed. They’ve been spreading all over the damn place. Granted I’m not much for religion, but given what I know from what Yinen has said about Neroth AND seen what these fanatics do first hand, I’m not exactly keen on them spreading any further.” You add. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m serious. You don’t notice how chipper she is when she speaks to you? How she makes these girly giggles over shit you say which isn’t even funny half the time? How she makes every effort to be very close or even touch your arm or hand when you’re around? If the girl was anymore obvious, she’d have her legs wrapped around you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Grand Matriarch! Are you hurt!? I can heal you!” Gwen asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Well even if you were going to try to talk Vera out of this, you doubt if you’d succeed or at least you doubt you’d succeed without a lot of drama which might very well result in something pretty devastating for everyone. <EOS>
<BOS> “Perhaps, but I’m just not sure if the Baroness is a sure thing in the future. If Peter invades and assuming the League here survives the chaos of it, from what I’ve heard Peter is lot more of a law and order fanatic than his father and siblings. He’s going to re-establish Delantium law here and that means a whole lot less freedom.” <EOS>
<BOS> She first goes on to complain that there is no lift so she has to walk to her room on the top floor like a commoner. This is even worse news for you since now you have to lug everything up several flights of stairs. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t think it’s really for me Warts.” <EOS>
<BOS> You leave the zorch rat and cross the drawbridge, coming to a heavy-looking iron door with a spike-inlaid surface. At the center is a large knocker. You grab ahold to knock at the door, but instantly find yourself standing in a huge column-lined meeting hall, somewhere within the tower, dominated at the far end by a full-wall painting of Medusa – eye’s blazing.  Lining the sides of the hall are a number of exceptionally fine statues depicting armored minotaurs. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera’s hand doesn’t move away from yours, instead she just squeezes yours a bit more. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point several people start booing again until the mayor calls for order. <EOS>
<BOS> When you arrive, the place is the busiest you’ve ever seen. The merriment is even spilling outside a bit. So much so that you notice Klyton Watchmen milling about nearby which makes you a bit nervous. You head inside as fast as you can, fighting through the crowds. <EOS>
<BOS> These soldiers seem to have made up their mind about you and trying to explain things is probably just going to get you a beating. You figure if you’re going before a judge, you can always explain things to him and hope he takes mercy, though you aren’t optimistic about it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure I’m not going to be pissing off any pirate boyfriends of yours?” <EOS>
<BOS> "This is for you," he continues, "100 silver. Don't spend it all in one place." <EOS>
<BOS> “Cowardly sonof…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad you’re staying optimistic.” <EOS>
<BOS> "They have found a way." you whisper mournfully. <EOS>
<BOS> “I gotta say, this is still pretty unusual for me. That other woman mentioned someone called Ardan, I mean I don’t want your husband…” <EOS>
<BOS> As for you, you’ve mostly managed to keep away from the majority of the fighting. You’ve only taken a bit of collateral damage from a couple of your businesses getting destroyed, but that was to be expected. All in all, you’ve been doing okay. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s Grand Matriarch to you and I don’t see why she’d want to see you at all.” <EOS>
<BOS> “New how?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Exactly. But we needn’t dwell on such morbid situations now. You are safe with me and I shall make sure no harm will come to your…body…” <EOS>
<BOS> He had it! Rom finished his day of work, brushing down the horses and feeding them supper, then went to his own small bunk and workshop. He put together a sprayer, with crushed berries and grasses to make a paint, then returned to the field before sun-up. For an hour he sprayed, then returned to the stables to feed the horses. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh? Well more apologies then, I didn’t realize I was speaking to a master fucking thief. Of course if you’re so good, why the hell are you wandering out here in the boonies? Shouldn’t you be stealing the King of Delantium’s jeweled chamber pot or something?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, I don’t like being fucking touched and I’m not fucking interested.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Wait, are you going to go over and kill her?" Vaughn asks. <EOS>
<BOS> After a few months, you maintain a more defensive posture and focus on consolidation of your own forces while Ludmilla spares no expensive in stomping out the Joachimite religion in the city. Eventually enough oppressive laws along with Ludmilla somehow coming to a deal with the Dornans to provide minor assistance the Inquisitor’s last holdout with his most fanatical followers are tracked down and defeated. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay. I heard Zamed lives, but do you know of the other pirate captains?” <EOS>
<BOS> “True, though I think I make more coin selling the various hospital drugs I steal. If I actually knew how to make the shit, I’d probably just do that instead because its far less work especially since there’s practically no competition. Unless you count the various Green Lotus dealers and they certainly don’t count.” <EOS>
<BOS> He waves a hand and you gasp, finding you have your voice again. "What do you mean?" <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve also acquired a few other firearms over the years as well. You’ve got a musket, a blunderbuss, and various other one shot flintlocks. <EOS>
<BOS> Warts has wasted no time and already cut into back the bandit’s legs. The bandit falls and you kick away his dropped weapon while Warts proceeds to crawl on the bandit’s back and repeatedly stab the hell out of him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Actually I do Virgil, but I need a favor from you.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> A few of your regulars throw in a coin each, but the crowd quickly disperses. A couple people clap you on the shoulder and say a soft farewell and wish you luck. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well maybe that’s what he wants to do. Here.” Vera gives you a small piece of parchment with some writing on it. “He gave this to our people and this apparently is an address of where he’s currently staying at and said you can meet him there at anytime. You want me to just have some people bring him here though?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I hope you aren’t asking me to train him, I’m far too old and like my free time too much. Honestly, he’s probably not going to display too much power until he’s a little older than he is right now. However, I suppose I do have an old magic tome I can sell you. I don’t need it anymore and I have a few more, but he should probably start off with something simple when it looks like his abilities are getting a bit out of hand. While you may not be magical yourself, you can still assist him. Don’t worry, it’s in common so you or your wife can at least read the words in it, assuming you’re both literate.” <EOS>
<BOS> Only time will tell if any of these changes mean shit though. <EOS>
<BOS> “I wish we could, kid. I don’t fancy a climb back up sheer mountain just to receive a punishment and get locked inside a sieged castle. We’re better off staying in the open and taking the fight to the Empire.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why? What’s holding you here now?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I thought the empire was supposed to be making the land safe. So much for their promises, well anyway, thanks for saving my life. I froze up a bit when that orc didn’t go down with the second arrow.” The woman says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait a minute, is Warts part of the Thieves Guild?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I knew those orcs were specifically targeting Nocturnal League businesses.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Then why are you still willing to work with me?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Take him,” Mordecai directs. You uncross your legs and stand, preparing for the two approaching guards. You swat away their attempt to shackle your wrists, and instead clasp the iron yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> “Elias likes dick.” <EOS>
<BOS> These twins, a boy and a girl, had possibly even more of a loving home than their father did and they certainly had even more comforts and advantages. Truly when they grew up, they could be anything they set their minds to. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? Oh I did not. You probably just got the burn. Just go to the apothecary and get yourself the antidote. That’s what other people do.” <EOS>
<BOS> To your left, Seth is a whirlwind of fury and blade. While full sweeping attacks, complete with jumping, are inadvisable for a prolonged skirmish, you can’t help but admire the technique in action. The attacks are swift and unconventional, even if they do require a tremendous amount of physical effort. You take the opposite approach, not moving your sword more than you have to. Instead of deep lunging thrusts, you slide in and out of range the exact amount needed. There is no showmanship, only the task before you. <EOS>
<BOS> His eye patch has a claw symbol on it. His comrade with the crossbow is still unknown to you since you haven’t turned around at all. About all you tell is that they’re very fond of that crossbow. <EOS>
<BOS> Sheesh, this is pretty damn depressing. It’s almost enough to make you rethink your own career choice. Almost. <EOS>
<BOS> You fall for quite a long time, much longer than you thought you would actually. For a brief moment you think maybe you’ve fallen down a bottomless pit. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I’m not talking about what happened with the League, that was just…bad management on my part though I suppose the curse played a part in my bad decisions.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Thanks.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay sure. Just put that box over there and I’ll get it for you.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm happy sis. I really am." <EOS>
<BOS> You on the other hand are feeling a little weird. Not like your life is suddenly being drained out of you, but more like a feeling of energy around you. Almost like your hair is starting to stand on end. Must be all the magic being thrown about. <EOS>
<BOS> Camid is one of the younger Crimson Talons. He's always been a bit outspoken about how things should be run, but he's more or less always complied. A few other Talons with his mindset also express their dissatisfaction. <EOS>
<BOS> "It has? Congratulations." <EOS>
<BOS> “You saying that wouldn’t happen?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Enough! We’ve apparently solved your problem, now we’re moving on. Demon, I command YOU to transfer the life essence of that woman over there to me.” Heather yells. <EOS>
<BOS> You hit the ground hard. Too hard. The decaying castle floor gives way to your impact. You tumble through darkness in a storm of wood, stone, and ceramic. You land, getting the wind knocked from your lungs. A crash and groan nearby alerts you that Seth has similarly hit the bottom of...wherever this is. <EOS>
<BOS> “Think I’ve heard some of the Hessla pirates we deal with mention it sometimes. Don’t know much though.” <EOS>
<BOS> At least you think you are. <EOS>
<BOS> Ragar the Unbroken fires several more shadow bolts towards the monks. Each is absorbed through into the shield. Brother Samuel sees the Grandmaster’s eyes squint slightly in concentration, then his eyes turn the same pure white emanating from the medallion. The Grandmaster expertly weaves his arms forward. The energy absorbed into the shield begins to redirect into a ball firing straight towards Ragar. The blast explodes into the wall sending chunks of rock to the floor. <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re half way to your room, you hear the patter of feet running behind you and you quickly turn around with your pistol. <EOS>
<BOS> “I have an idea of why, but what I don’t understand is why you would tell me directly.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Is that right? Well maybe we can spare the extra time to go back to my place. We’re taking a carriage though.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> One of them looks up as he’s counting coins while the other is sorting out blue dream vials. Neither one of them particularly likes you, so this will be all the more simple. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Vera’s on her knees in front of you and her face is practically making a beeline towards your crotch. While this “offer isn’t completely unenticing, you’ve got some reservations and not just the usual ones. <EOS>
<BOS> “What about the Temple of Fel? I mean I’m still hazy on how what the ECS and their temple’s relationship is, but aren’t they allies?” <EOS>
<BOS> You step inside one of the magic university buildings and expect to be stopped or “greeted” much like how you were in Holgard by Heather’s underlings. Instead you encounter nobody and walk down several empty corridors almost wondering if the place has been abandoned. <EOS>
<BOS> You pass back through the main part of town and gather what information you can: <EOS>
<BOS> You soon no longer feel the crossbow at your back and that’s when you know it’s okay to move again. <EOS>
<BOS> You're kneeling on your good leg and leaning up against a wall in an attempt to get back up, when the militia finally catch up to you. You feel a hard blow to your back and you crash to the floor. Several militia surround your prone body. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re inspecting the driver, you hear rustling in the carriage, along with some groans. Looks like Elana lived. If she wants to continue living, she better comply. <EOS>
<BOS> "And he tells stories." <EOS>
<BOS> “GET AWAY FROM HER MURDERER!” a gruff voice shouts from behind. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit. Man, you’re going to definitely be marked now. I’m surprised you didn’t just leave the city.” Sinin says. <EOS>
<BOS> You catch her before you can leave. "Do you mind if I fill in, just during lunch?" you ask. "I'm a storyteller myself." <EOS>
<BOS> If someone was a kind soul that was checking, your life might have been still saved by a healing potion or even medical attention. However the militia just assumes you’re just one of the many law breaking casualties and they toss your unconscious body on the cart with the rest of the dead after they’ve taken the living into custody. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sounds like you’ve made up your mind.” <EOS>
<BOS> Rom discarded all these tactics. He whispered to the horses, and watched them for a few days, and concluded: the horses were simply bored. To get them to run faster, he must find a way to cheer them up! Spirited horses would certainly be better racers. <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile there are more qweepas coming up from the stairs. A lot of them. You and your other underling immediately run back up the stairs, while qweepas are biting at your heels the whole time. Some of them are even managing to leap on your back. <EOS>
<BOS> “…well shit kid. That’s pretty damn horrible. Guess you did what you had to then, I can respect that. Did she…” <EOS>
<BOS> The old wizard motions you to follow him and mentions that his name is Ahmed. When you ask where are all the other wizards, he says that most of the staff are at some conference and as for any students, the few that they do have are currently out performing their field assignments for classes so they wouldn’t really be lingering around here. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’ll deal with it now!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit. It’s the only way now.” You mutter to yourself and mentally prepare yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’d rather take my chances sneaking pass some bandits than possibly dealing with something I can’t even hurt.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You can’t tell anyone!” <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, find a new place to live I guess. Maybe move some place more upscale, hey how exactly DID you pull off living in a dorm anyway? I mean I have so many question about that situation.” <EOS>
<BOS> You see a female elf wearing next to nothing save for a few tattoos approach. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well according to the paper it says the vigilante used a hellfire thrower to wipe out the Talon enclave, but there is also evidence that firebombs were also used." Mr. Reynolds says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey boss, we found a trapdoor, looks like it goes down into a cellar. Um, we also lost Orin. Got a bunch of spikes in the face when he opened the trap door.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Not really. I mean that seems to be a side effect of all this, but honestly I don’t care who worships what. I believe the pursuit of keeping magic alive is more important than worship at this point. I’m not sure if you realize it, but magic isn’t exactly a common thing nowadays and has been in decline. In a couple hundred years after the last few powerful wizards die out, what then? Dorna is a the goddess of magic and knowledge, I can better serve her through teaching rather than just worship.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Almost did.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Just a few times…are you going to kill me?” Madeline asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You look around for potential traps or alarms around the display cases and find nothing, so you get started and begin carefully cutting the glass. <EOS>
<BOS> This city used to have a fairly large active miner population once. In fact your family made money serving them at their inn. At some point long after your parents had left the city and the inn closed down, the mining trade dried up completely in Klyton for a variety of reasons resulting in a lot of unemployed miners. <EOS>
<BOS> The best you can do is try to cover yourself until eventually one person tells them all to stop. <EOS>
<BOS> “A bard?” <EOS>
<BOS> Sage is the closest of the muses. His hands are lifted in the air, his wise eyes fixed on something far off. Vrolik is smirking - there is even a bit of color left in his cheeks, and his staff is in mid-twirl. Bivedos looks to be hovering off the ground at first glance, legs crossed, but you see after a moment's inspection that he is balancing on a tail. Willow has her eyes covered, as if weeping - a common enough pose for her in life, so perhaps it is a fitting posture for her in death. Mizeria stands strong, daunting, a cry of pure rage on her face. Her arms, like Sage's, are lifted, but unlike his that seem to pull an invisible power to him, hers are palms up, fingers curled, as if pushing something away. You notice that each of them is somewhat mottled in appearance; some parts are grey, like plain stone, while other parts are colorful like wax and almost glow with life. Some of them seem more alive than others, and that life calls to your own. <EOS>
<BOS> After a few more of your people check out the immediate room below, you descend down the ladder. You give a quick look and see that this room wasn’t dug out recently. It was actually part of the original house since it actually has solid walls and a solid floor. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well your help could have gotten me killed what with you stumbling all over the place.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I guess not.” <EOS>
<BOS> That sort of makes you feel more worried than you were before. <EOS>
<BOS> “You hid his…nevermind. Probably good thinking on your part given what we’re planning.” <EOS>
<BOS> You really don’t like this idea, but you’re here now so you might as well go all the way with it. However, you’re not giving your weapons over to this Delantium tight ass. You instead hand them to one of your hobs and tell them to go back to the ship. This is fine with the Delantium solder and he tells you to follow him. <EOS>
<BOS> Ornery as usual. <EOS>
<BOS> On the plus side, it’s kept your mind off Vera completely. <EOS>
<BOS> “Kill them all!” you shout. The men cheer at your command and rush through the gates. Their charge meets waiting white and gold, crashing into their defensive posture and ripping through their ranks. Through the mix of steel and bone, you remain focused on the inner gate to the keep. The soldiers are but a nuisance in your way. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not as close as you think and as I am a dedicated follower to Fel, I believe my strong relationship to them would help me more. At worst they would stay neutral. At best, well let’s just say I’ve got very strong ties to the temple here and I know for a fact that being aligned with Fel is going to be the way of the future here in Holgard. I don’t take it you’re a believer yet though.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Join us...under the sea...everything's better with us under the sea..." <EOS>
<BOS> “Good, you remember the order was to keep him alive right?” <EOS>
<BOS> When you get to Jicol, it’s looking about as well as it did the last time you bothered to come here. It’s a bit of a chore to get to your destination since it’s right around where most of the flooding occurred so you have to take a small boat to the area. <EOS>
<BOS> “So…there are hobgoblins in this area?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “They were potentially fucking stealing money and talking about sensitive information, what the fuck else were you waiting for?!” <EOS>
<BOS> You put away your pistol and crouch down besides Vera who is still upset and probably expecting you to kill her. <EOS>
<BOS> She’s going to have to be dealt with in a more permanent manner. <EOS>
<BOS> Two small fiery comets shoot across the sky and land in the encampment. From wherever Richard is hiding, his flame arrows land true. The fire instantly expands on the canvas and spreads to nearby tents. Men begin to shout and you see multiple bodies rushing from their tents to find some way to extinguish the spreading flame. <EOS>
<BOS> You almost want to say something, specifically argue with Flynn, but you know that’s not going to help and will be useless. You need to let Tanya go even if it is hard to do. This is going to be for your own good. It’s also going to get you help with the Joachimites, which is sort of the main reason why you came here in the first place, but that seems more like a secondary concern now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah that’s fine.” <EOS>
<BOS> “HEY!” he shouts which causes you to hurl the metal object at his head before you make a small leap to climb out the window. <EOS>
<BOS> “I figured. Can’t really blame you, though I am disappointed since I think not only would you be an asset, but I think you might have learned a few things yourself. It might not seem like it, but some of the folks here are pretty good at their craft.” <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t know if you can keep up this stonewall face much longer… <EOS>
<BOS> Except this isn’t the demon of war form that you’ve been seeing. This isn’t even her succubus form. It’s the form of the girl you fell love with. Even her clothes are the same. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh well, I guess it will have to do. Just hope we don’t run into anything bigger than a hungry rat.” <EOS>
<BOS> No sooner have you opened the door when the odor of Virgil hits you full force. You immediately cover your nose and mouth. <EOS>
<BOS> “No thanks, I’m good.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno. Some mask of some sort I imagine since it’s a costume party. Which makes me wonder, how the hell is the Baroness going to know it’s me if I’m wearing a mask?” <EOS>
<BOS> Percy apparently didn’t even try to help his friend and just ran off. He still cut down a few people along the way, but nobody can guess where he is now. <EOS>
<BOS> “You know who I am?” <EOS>
<BOS> And then several more on both sides. You really begin to panic when you start to have a hard time moving the oars. The mermaids are determined to stop you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good. I’m glad. That’s what I’m here for.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that’s definitely possible, but it still doesn’t explain why we would be targeted so much and so accurately. I would think he’d want to focus his forces on taking the palace or taking out the mage school. Also his invasion force was a lot larger than first reports mentioned.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well apparently they were too busy with other things than bothering with the likes of the kid here. In any case I’m just saying we need to thin out their ranks or something because while I know we aren’t officially territorial, we shouldn’t have to deal with daggers at our throats right outside our front door.” Sneaks says. <EOS>
<BOS> In another couple hours, a runner finally comes to you with news that your people have opened the gates and fighting is going on all over the city. Marco and his crew successfully entered the harbor and managed to fool the Jicol Watch long enough to break through and start joining the attack on the city. <EOS>
<BOS> Seeing as you’ve only got one shot left and no real time to reload, you turn your attention back to the EC leader, who is now gone. Tanya is still working on two other EC members and you’re about to go over to help her, when a magic missile of some sort hits you. <EOS>
<BOS> You sit down across from him and he tells his driver to get on their way before turning his attention completely to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I already know about Joachim’s blessed light. You tried to tell me about it the first time I came here and you nearly threw up on me in the process.” <EOS>
<BOS> You run through the increasingly unstable temple which is already starting to collapse from weakened structure in an attempt to find your wife and child. <EOS>
<BOS> “Bah, I still think you drug him with Yellow Devil.” Gil says handing over the coin. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I want to be fully awake for when you ravish me.” <EOS>
<BOS> Surprisingly you think you might have gotten through to Annah this time, as she quietly nods her head instead of her usual routine of talking back. She then goes to hug you, which you return. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s been awhile, but it’s good to see Vera again even if she’s just here for a visit. She’s got some strong opinions on some of the changes that have happened recently though. <EOS>
<BOS> “Do what?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Anyway, I have your payment. Um, just so we’re clear how much was it again?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Nobody saw you right?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Annah….look, I’m sorry about my tone okay? But you gotta understand I’m trying to deal with all this shit and I can hardly think right now. I mean I didn’t even think I was going to see you again. I’m also worried about my parents. I mean yeah I didn’t get along with them, but they certainly don’t deserve the shitstorm they’re probably going through with the rest of the town right now. I mean what about your mom? You don’t think she’s wondering where you are right now?” you say while rubbing her shoulders <EOS>
<BOS> As your body goes numb and your vision now starts to darken, you genuinely think you’re dying. You see Annah stand over you and then everything goes black. <EOS>
<BOS> "Storyteller, are you ready?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Nah, I can make the trip down there. He’s not Nocturnal League anyway, so he doesn’t need to know our hideout. Though who knows, maybe we’ll have a new member. Could use the help right about now. Anyway, why don’t you start making the arrangements for your trip to Jicol.” <EOS>
<BOS> After some stealthy moves you get in and begin rummaging through empty rooms. You’re doing fairly well until you get to your fifth room and as you’re going through one of the drawers you suddenly hear a little growl. <EOS>
<BOS> "So how did it go?" Zal asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Last time I helped YOU.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I said Yaz. You know, the god of fortune? I don’t suppose he’s worshipped in Galpatolis.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Honestly, you’re the ONLY person I’ve told about this and now that I’ve done it, I feel a little weird and vulnerable.” <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you hit something, or rather something scrapes the bottom of your boat. At first you think it's the mermaids trying to tip it over or something, but you risk opening your eyes and find that you've hit land or at least the rocks near it. In fact you've damaged the boat and you once again find yourself aboard a sinking ship. <EOS>
<BOS> Gloom warily looks at you as he slowly takes the orb. When he finally grabs it, he seems to relax a little more, but he’s definitely not comfortable. Still he hasn’t killed you yet, so that’s a good sign. Meanwhile you’re doing your best to remain calm yourself under these conditions, so you continue to speak. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m more of its…yes, well I guess leader would be the term, but honestly I hate it. You’re probably thinking I’m here to press gang you into joining, but I’m not. In fact there was a time when this place was filled with freelance thieves. The city is a big thriving place after all, plenty of loot to go around. Our Guild is more of a club of sorts rather than some sinister octopus organization. People join because they want to, well that and the fact that we do tend to pull off the more lucrative jobs and get better deals on selling stolen merchandise. You have to do a job for the good of the Guild every now and then, but even then you still get a cut of the money. But I’m sure to some extent, you’re aware of some of this.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Before you caught up to me, I was about ready to leave the city.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ok Tanya, you’ve made your point, I’m leaving. Thanks for saving me again, see you later.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I see. Well our criminal friend here certainly does have a unique condition. I would be very interested in learning how this came about exactly.” Elder Flynn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Without another word, Vera hugs and kisses you lovingly, which then leads to sex. You can’t help but think that the whole slave trade subject must turn her on in some way which is another reason for her enthusiasm, but it’s hardly surprising given what you know about her. Vera’s got some fucked up sexual quirks. <EOS>
<BOS> Afterward, she spreads her wings our again and flies high above the city. You never thought you’d see Holgard from this view again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, no…but I’m working up to it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Because most of the hobs are fucking dead that’s why, which is another loss since a lot of them were our best pit fighters. And I highly recommend you take it way down, before I take YOU down.” <EOS>
<BOS> “The drugs? Well Green Lotus or a milder form of it is legal here now, so that’s out. Yellow Devil as far as I know was never a big money maker due to it having a major chance of causing the user’s innards to melt and bleed from every orifice. Of course Blue Dream is the big one nowadays, but the Ebony Claw Syndicate mostly has a monopoly on its production and distribution. None of us knows how to make it or has connections. But then drugs have never been an interest of mine. The Talons actually did control a few whorehouses at one time, until government shut them all down and then built some nicer, fancier and Klyton run ones. Being a whore has never been more respectable. Okay, maybe not. But the point is, the Klyton Council effectively destroyed the Talons by legalizing shit and taking it over more than they ever did with just the militia.” <EOS>
<BOS> Any plan to attack Jicol is going to come at a cost. Since you aren’t sure what to do, you ask the only person you trust about all this. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright! Alright! Fuck. Dere better be a sizable donat…(hic!) donation fer Joachim.” <EOS>
<BOS> You give a small bow to the Baroness, believing that you probably should show some sort of deference to her station. She seems to like that, and then you turn to leave because honestly you can’t get out of there fast enough. <EOS>
<BOS> As he moves, his plain robe sways in the air as if drapes hung over an open window. With one hand around the mug, and the other grasping his walking cane, he exits the monestary’s library. The simple gray stones lining the hallway appear black, except for the small area around the lit torches, not that Brother Samuel required sight to navigate his way around. The silence of the night is disturbed by the steady tap, tap, tap of his wooden cane on the stone floor. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah it sucks.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So basically Tanya is your excuse for your actions?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, I got that impression. (Sigh) This is why I didn't think this was going to just go smoothly." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Garrick gives you a dirty look and starts assigning tasks to people. He doesn’t give one to you though. <EOS>
<BOS> “Another time perhaps. So what about you? You still living your usual frugal existence? I’m guessing so if you’re concerned about your living arrangements.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera, thanks for the information and I’ll take steps to prepare just in case, but I’m not just abandoning Holgard unless it’s really hopeless.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno! I mean I just…I was drunk okay! She or he or whatever wanted to get fucked in the ass and I wasn’t thinking with anything except my dick at that point. Oh shit, I feel sick…” Hank says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Grm. Youz gotta have a better eye and pray to Yag more. Anywayz, come on let’s get goin, don’t wanna stand out here tooz long. Dis path is da one.” <EOS>
<BOS> You soon see several sources of the squeaking running at you from the darkness of the bottom of the stairwell. <EOS>
<BOS> “How do you know this?” <EOS>
<BOS> Year 27 <EOS>
<BOS> "So who is this hopeless gambling case who owns this property exactly?" You ask Vaughn. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point, you’re wondering why you’re bothering. <EOS>
<BOS> You wait in silence for a bit, and then eventually the other one comes out and nods. <EOS>
<BOS> "No, he isn't." A voice says and you turn around and see Zalmora. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well, not much of one I suppose. I'm currently trying to find new recruits for my captain. Not much luck so far though. You wouldn't be interested would you?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, thought it was unusual. Anyway, your students are having their own problem with demons that they’re fighting in the streets right now. I think the other wizard keeps summoning them.” <EOS>
<BOS> You didn’t expect that. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not necessarily, he could just do it over time. He is a god after all.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Doomed city? Why do you say that?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> After lighting a couple torches, you get a better look at your surroundings and the place looks about like what you’d expect, though it’s obviously much bigger than the temple in Holgard. It’s also covered in spiderwebs. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 21 <EOS>
<BOS> “This day has come sooner than I expected, child,” he speaks. <EOS>
<BOS> “How come you don’t enter him in the fights? He’s big enough and his teeth are larger than the average qweepa.” Trent asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, that doesn’t solve your current problem. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t mean to intrude,” you say with a slight bow. “This man, Seth, is important to me. He practically raised me since…” you trail off at the end, not wanting to divulge your history at the monastery. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m fine,” you say shaking the image of Seth’s skull from your mind. “I’m focused on the task at hand.” <EOS>
<BOS> "You do?" <EOS>
<BOS> While your enemies are distracted, you need to get to a better location. The entire temple to on alert anyway, so you should be getting reinforcements soon. While your ring might not seem like it’s helping, you’re actually moving at your own speed rather than suffering from whatever slow effects that were cast. <EOS>
<BOS> Niro suggested his group follow a creek. He listened to where the birds sounded most musical, watched for where the ferns grew most green, and tasted the air for where it was sweetest. After two days they came across a clearing, within which stood a building made of living trees. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe nothing so grand as a city, but something like a smaller version of Hessla except with us in charge.” <EOS>
<BOS> And you fail. <EOS>
<BOS> "Not bloody likely. I've been thinking about this for a long time and ever since we got this inn together, I've been thinking about it even more. The time has come and I'm out." <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t help but wonder if feelings were running a little deeper than she let on. She probably took it for granted that you wouldn’t ever be involved seriously with someone else. She also took it for granted that you weren’t going to eventually get tired of her shit. <EOS>
<BOS> The Unbroken summons a sword from your palm and drives it into the neck of the wyvern. In a distressed cry, the beast descends in a dive straight for the edge of the bluffs. Gathering speed, your eyes water at the rush of air. Your hand grabs one of the wyvern’s horns in order to keep your body from flying from the wyvern’s back. The ground is fast approaching. There’s no way either you or the Emperor can survive the impact. <EOS>
<BOS> And like that, Vera immediately does what she’s offered to do to you several times before in the past. It doesn’t take long before you’re more than ready for the main act, and given how good she apparently is, you need to stop her anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> "I know, I know, you aren't to speak to me." He smiles, "completely understandable. I appreciate a man of discretion. So, just listen. I could use a man of your skills who doesn't mind getting his hands dirty. You could come work for me. Captain Brost would not refuse me if I ask it. I'd pay you 20 silver per patient, and you'd live in fine quarters and have all the food and hot baths you'd like." He smiles as if offering you the world. "Just nod if you'd prefer it. I'll go ask the Captain right now." <EOS>
<BOS> “I saw the entire battle from the deck of my own ship and Elias you WERE about to sail away. In fact your ship and crew took the least damage out of everyone here! You oughta be glad that I’m not shooting you and taking half your share!” Zamed says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, look at me. I’m a daughter of hell, seducer and destroyer of men, yet I still have these pathetic feelings of love for you. I can’t move on like you suggested. I can’t deal with this separation.” <EOS>
<BOS> Wouldn’t take much to just grab the blunderbuss and hijack this whole carriage. <EOS>
<BOS> Not wishing to debate it any longer with Zal, you leave and head to where you remember Madeline was supposed to be overseeing today which is the new headquarters being built. <EOS>
<BOS> “I heard Brother Samuel say it once. More than once actually,” she replies, curling a strand of bright blonde hair behind her ear. <EOS>
<BOS> “The difference is you’re not going to live to see the results because if you think I’m going to just hand my son over, you’re fucking delusional.” <EOS>
<BOS> Garrick turns back to Tanya. <EOS>
<BOS> The Delantium Kingdom is a large piece of territory and whether they’re increasing their military endeavors or not, there are still bound to be places where the security is going to be less than adequate. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s fine. I’ll take Kol with me.” <EOS>
<BOS> A few days later, you treat yourself to a new (well, thrifted) wardrobe better suited to the hot, tropical climate. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 21 <EOS>
<BOS> You head down the gangway towards freedom before he can change his mind. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tryin’ to take dis thing off, wat’s it look like ya idjit? Help me over here.” Warts says trying to take off the sewer lid. <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course he is. Y’know, that’s probably why these idiots got themselves kicked out of the Delantium University in the first place, dabbling with necromancy and demonology. That shit could potentially destroy a world if used as reckless as it has been here. Well guess I better sort this out, before taking a break.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Come, my little prince, we’ll make a game out of it today.” She says. <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re stripping off a robe of one of the corpses, Tanya’s looking around as if she’s expecting more trouble. While that might very well be the case, you can tell it’s more than that. <EOS>
<BOS> As for you, you climb to a sturdy and large enough branch that will support your weight and you can at least somewhat perch yourself on. You already know you aren’t going to sleep deep tonight, but you figure that’s sort of been the standard problem while out here. <EOS>
<BOS> Well this is a little different than you were expecting. You thought this was going to be a negotiation, not begging for a hand out. The temple of Fel really has fallen on hard times if they’ve been reduced to this state. <EOS>
<BOS> “Relax, Nature’s Revenge isn’t even here yet, that’s just some opening act and it only just started. If you were late, I would have woke you up.” Annah says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. Apologies. I was just thinking about your situation and I was wondering if you’ve tried being more supportive of her.” <EOS>
<BOS> You inform the rest of the League of your plan and assign your most skilled to start finding ways (or making ways) of sneaking into the city now. You tell them not to engage anyone and to keep a low profile while they’re scouting the security and such. You then tell them you want a report on everything within the next few days. <EOS>
<BOS> “I figured dey can take part in robbin’ da merchants gig we got going now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well then I guess you’ve made your choice.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah here on time as always. Glad to see you continue with that habit. And I also see that you’ve brought no other protection with you either for this meeting. Very interesting that you should be so trusting, but then your relationship with the Syndicate has been a cordial one so why should there be animosity?” Percy says. <EOS>
<BOS> “You. You have to go. I’m not having my daughter not achieve her rightful destiny by holding on to her misguided love for you. Now, you can stay to see her graduate, but then you need to leave. And I don’t mean just here. You need to leave the city and go some place far away. If you’re dreaming about her, that means she’s already starting to imprint on you. However, she’s probably not strong enough to find you if you the city. By then her mother and maybe even I will have convinced her to embrace her powers.” <EOS>
<BOS> Not wishing to spend all night fumbling around in the dark outside looking for a rodent, you head inside your small home. <EOS>
<BOS> No sign of the Jicol Watch, in fact no sign of anyone. You use this opportunity to loot the bodies of whatever valuables they might have had on them since you need the coin for the book anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> You manage to catch a buggy back to the slums of Klyton and from there you make your way back to headquarters. <EOS>
<BOS> The Headsman officer tells the others to place you into a kneeling position and put your head down. Of course you try to resist, but you just get some punches for your trouble. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya is silent the whole time as she holds you close to her body and flies away from Holgard and eventually landing in a spot not far outside it, but away from anyone else. <EOS>
<BOS> “I had considered that, hence why I suggested changing the formula.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You get to near the top of the landing and then it goes completely dark. You then feel several hands grab at you You manage to fire off your pistol once before several hands take it from you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Severed heads of fucking loudmouths and spies. Look, I got important shit to talk to Rook about and I just dragged my ass through riots to get here, so let me the fuck in.” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Stop talking, I don’t want to hear your voice. This has to happen.” You hear a voice say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Nope, it’s true. Wish I could have stopped that fool Mantis BEFORE we met, but seems like you took care of that. Oh and thanks for eliminating a rival tonight. Anyway, I trust you’ll be making the right decision, because it would be a shame if I had to kill you the next time we see each other.” Rook then chuckles a bit at his comment. <EOS>
<BOS> Third day is a little different as you hear the clopping of horses behind you. At first you get concerned that someone from Teckleville is galloping your way, but a quick glance shows it’s just a merchant caravan. A fairly big one too since you see several men on horseback along with a carriage and large wagon behind it. <EOS>
<BOS> Surprisingly your father doesn’t say much more, he just gathers up his emergency physician’s bag and mutters to himself. You think you hear him saying how you’re a fuck up before he leaves, but that’s about it. <EOS>
<BOS> You snicker a bit at the thought of Warts having a couple kids, but you suppose he seems happy with them. You’re just glad you aren’t saddled with any; you’ve got enough complications in your life. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well you look good anyway, not sure about your clothing though, a little too colorful for my tastes, but then you always were the flashy one." <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, sir?” the tavern keeper says. <EOS>
<BOS> "I won't bunk with a simpleton," the robed woman spits. <EOS>
<BOS> You collapse back to the floor as Heather’s screams get fainter to your ears and your last sight before your vision fades, is Heather’s body literally ripping and exploding into bloody chunks of gore and now a different form looms over you. <EOS>
<BOS> “I was actually coming to do more than just be a distraction, but suddenly I was getting attacked by a hundred dead bean counters.” <EOS>
<BOS> You find a tree that looks sturdy and high enough, so you climb it and prepare to sleep for the night. You just hope that anyone that might still be looking for you at this late hour doesn’t think to look up. <EOS>
<BOS> No sooner has this runner given you this information when a loud explosion is heard along with a visible black cloud in the distance of the city, you surmise that Marco’s merchant ship that was also full of explosives was set off in the harbor. <EOS>
<BOS> After getting to the room, she complains that it doesn’t match anything she’s used to in Klyton and goes on about how inferior it is. You almost feel like saying you live in a place run by a cranky old man and how your closest neighbors consist of a drunken priest and a whore. <EOS>
<BOS> Around this time you get a message back from Vera who expresses concern about the new developments with the Syndicate. <EOS>
<BOS> Aeric’s men allow you to pack your gear, along with several days of rations, a huge kindness in your opinion, before leading you to the southern end of the castle. The narrow bridge to the front gates lies on the north side. The south is sheer mountainside. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmm, you might have a point there.” Vaughn says. <EOS>
<BOS> If that is the case you realize it’s probably a good thing that you didn’t say anything about Flynt. The last thing you need right now is a pissed off gang member wanting to kill you for being a rat. In fact, it makes you wonder if you should say anything to the judge at all. If this Ebony Claw Syndicate is as sinister as they sound, it might be dangerous to go ratting on their people. Of course that doesn’t leave you many options. <EOS>
<BOS> Fuck it, you need another drink. <EOS>
<BOS> "Her name's Wendy and she lives in a small house over by the Greenwood park. I think it's like the only house still standing there since most of the others are abandoned." Vaughn says. <EOS>
<BOS> Matters of court aside, you look forward to a pleasant evening, and to the beginning of the camel caravan tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t reply to that and instead just keep quiet, not wishing to dwell on any potential bedroom failings on your part, let alone Jake’s dick. <EOS>
<BOS> Zal smiles at you and pats you on the face a couple times. <EOS>
<BOS> “Do you have a problem with this plan?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Do you think we could just make a one time pay off for him to forget about us?" Vaughn asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Ardan is still giving you a look that could kill but seems to calm down enough that he opens the door to let you go through it first. <EOS>
<BOS> “Best ones usually are.” Your sister responds. <EOS>
<BOS> You sometimes forget that Zal is at least around fifteen years older than you now. She’s probably starting to worry about age catching up. Probably didn’t see herself mucking about through sewers at this age taking orders from someone a lot younger. Weird, because Vaughn doesn’t seem to have a problem with it, but then Vaughn’s never been one to make waves. <EOS>
<BOS> "I've taken everything away from you. Now I'm sending you to a very dark place and I'm going to enjoy sending you there." Henry whispers as he starts stripping off your armor. <EOS>
<BOS> You see Gwen attempting to cast another spell and that’s when you really point your pistol at her. <EOS>
<BOS> "A honeycomb," he replies, near instantly. He must be familiar with storytelling to have answered so quickly, and you can imagine his expectations will be high. The honeycomb is a classic item from many older fables and morality tales - in fact it featured so often that "learning the bees" had long been an idiom for studying ethics. <EOS>
<BOS> No sooner have you shut the door when you smell the air. It’s like something is on fire. At first you think it’s your home, but then you realize this isn’t a normal fire smell. <EOS>
<BOS> Well that peaked your interest. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…(hic).” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm? Yeah. Apologies, but I didn’t exactly have time to buy a sword on my way out of town.” <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora now puts her hand directly on your cock, which is definitely interested even if you claimed that you weren’t. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I guess not.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Did you want the League’s assistance?” <EOS>
<BOS> "A storyteller? That is somewhat exciting." She leans forward, "know any about the blood gods?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Not yet. What about you?” <EOS>
<BOS> “So it’s a all set. As you might have noticed I’ve brought some bags with me, I figured you won’t mind me staying here tonight. It’ll save time.” Annah remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> One thing that’s on the strange side is probably Kol. You were sort of expecting him to make a lot of noise or otherwise be lively during this whole thing, especially since this is his first real trip outside the temple, but he’s been fairly quiet. Then again he’s thankfully never been a loud child. <EOS>
<BOS> “I knew you’d make fun or not believe me.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> As you make your way towards the inn, you hear the clopping of horses behind you. At first you get concerned that someone from Teckleville is galloping your way, but a quick glance shows it’s probably just some other travellers given their relaxed pace. <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera, you can’t know that.” <EOS>
<BOS> The worst you believe was whenever you had to deal with magic shit. Specifically that time when you had to deal with the Neroth cultists. You really thought you were dead that night. If it hadn’t been for Tanya, you would have. <EOS>
<BOS> You quickly turn Marco over and he’s moaning about being in pain, which is probably true since his face has a hole in it where you guess he was stabbed. Fortunately it just missed his eye and the blade went into his upper cheek instead. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wat?” Warts asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Killing Reginald is going to take some scouting and planning. As far as you know the man is rarely ever leaving his house anymore or if he is, he’s not seen doing it. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t understand. You’re dealing drugs, running illegal fights, and other activities but being with someone who would rather be with you is where you draw the line?” <EOS>
<BOS> The monks were zealous in their beliefs, not allowing impurities of the body and mind to affect their training. I’m grateful for the discipline instilled in me at a young age. It made things easier. Not that it was an easy life. Rising before the sun to train, only to spend the daylight hours training even more, wasn’t an easy life. Habits are hard to break and the monks broke all of mine early on. My training became much more than lessons in discipline; it became a way of life. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well, sort of." <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, I’d say that would certainly go a long way in decreasing your rent. The problem with that plan is I’m going to have to pay for actual talent unless you know of some idiots that are going to work for free or practically for free.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, like I said, nothing much. Just dealing with smugglers and pirates, staying a step ahead of the law when I have to, trying to keep the organization together and keep turning a profit. You know the routine, you had to do it.” <EOS>
<BOS> From your position, you see Heather on the far side of the building with one raised hand in your direction. You also see the other wizard lying on the roof smoldering and still burning. You didn’t see it because you were too occupied with fighting corpses, but it would appear your arrival was enough distraction that allowed Heather to get the upper hand over her opponent. <EOS>
<BOS> “You sure you’re in the right business, boss?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well he claimed you did before he attacked me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well? Come on boy think! I know you lot engages in minor thievery and pointless vandalism. Were you planning on moving into drugs and whores? Get into the Qweepa fights perhaps? Unite all the criminals in the city into your little gang and take over all of Jicol’s underworld?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno. Maybe they’re preoccupied with other things…hey so since you work directly for Ludmilla now, have you been invited to any more of her fancy parties?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure thing, but how are you going to keep your elf from talking?” <EOS>
<BOS> When you get to your home, you show her around a bit makes a lot of comments about how nice the place is and that it’s better than her own current dwelling. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t say anything, while Rook continues to chuckle. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes after meeting with Marco, when I got lost I found that ruined temple. We didn’t explore it really though. Actually always meant to go back to give it a proper look though. I believe it was dedicated to Fel.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that IS what these women are going to be sold for right?” <EOS>
<BOS> Ardan swings a few more times and you duck and roll. You stab Ardan in the leg and while he’s fallen to one knee due to that wound, you achieve your goal of getting around him and out the door. <EOS>
<BOS> “I considered that as a private conflict between faith and saw no reason to bother you with it, I know you’re very busy and all. Though I do wonder how you found out about it, since we’ve very good about keeping this quiet. The Baroness would come down on everyone if the two remaining religious factions in the city were openly fighting in the streets.” Gloom says. <EOS>
<BOS> “What you don’t believe me? I would have never carried illegal drugs had I known!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I believe so.” <EOS>
<BOS> "That will have to wait!" The High Mage glances towards a staff in the center of a great white circle inscribed in the room. "It seems none of us can remain to take the staff to the grove." <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I did notice you carrying a little one on you back. Son huh? Well sit him on the table over there and tell me what’s going on then.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Anyway, Peter’s been at this for years ever since he got exiled. He’s suffered many set backs in his quest to retake Holgard. Every time he’s been on the verge of being ready, something has happened. This was partially thanks to the Ebony Claw Syndicate sabotaging his efforts in Delantium, and sometimes even the Temple of Fel would hinder his efforts as well. However, since things have changed drastically over the years in this city, he’s in the best position he’s ever been in to retake this place.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Took you long enough. Other members are in various places in the sewers ready to ambush any escaping Guild members.” One of them says. <EOS>
<BOS> Zal soon breaks up the silence though. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm. Where’s that girlfriend of yours?” <EOS>
<BOS> “What’s that? Wait, is that an egg?” Vaughn asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Just when you've decided you will have to inform the captain that you need to continue your pilgrimage, an interesting opportunity presents itself. One of the mages, the Journeyman you saw the first night and have seen several times since, initiates a conversation with you when Spryce heads above-deck. <EOS>
<BOS> "If that's true, then you're going to be there right along side with me." <EOS>
<BOS> Your mind races with a list of things you have to do. Even with Annah by your side, it’s still going to be overwhelming at first, but you still have hope that you’ll be able to find the fortune and purpose here that you weren’t going to find in Teckleville. <EOS>
<BOS> While it doesn’t help you out, it makes you wonder if this was “meant to happen.” Like were you supposed to go back in time and steal this crown? Did this originally happen? <EOS>
<BOS> You sort of think with as much grief as you give your parents, they might actually like to at least say goodbye to you seeing as they didn’t get that chance with your sister. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well no, she apparently came home with some guy and I had to sneak out.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Stay out of this Tanya! Everyone get to work! Except YOU.” <EOS>
<BOS> Your head is at his chest level right now, and mustering all your strength you manage to move your entire body forward and slam the top of your head up into his jaw repeatedly. He tries to stop you, but he still can’t get his arms entirely free. <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera? Nah, but I’m sure she’s probably running something on the side for herself. Which is fine by me if she is. I’d rather have her overlooking things there than anyone else.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hell yeah! This is fucking great! Warts, take the rest of the hobs here go on a street cleaning mission. There probably shouldn’t be too many of Peter’s men at this point, but the quicker these shitheads are gone, the better. Also make the rounds at all of our businesses too.” <EOS>
<BOS> The staff pulses from the middle of the circle. Its power calls to you, and somehow you understand its purpose. <EOS>
<BOS> As crazy as this is, you know Mr. Reynolds values his word. If he says Junior will wipe out all the targets, then he'll do it. There's also the fact that you haven't completely dismissed what Zal said about failing at the finish line. <EOS>
<BOS> “Just a question. If I hadn’t run all those years ago, would you have still killed me during the attack on the Guild?” Sneaks asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shut up Marco. Alright, let’s finish these fuckers for good.” You say to your people and motion to enter the place. <EOS>
<BOS> Seth’s eyes meet yours. “This is it then.” <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually the blood loss and organ damage takes enough of a toll on you that you begin to lose consciousness. You’re dying and at this point you don’t even care anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> It isn't until all your limbs are broken that you finally get a good look at the person doing this to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, this is the business we’re in kid. It ain’t always convenient and comfortable. Besides you get used to the smell. Come on.” <EOS>
<BOS> When Tom finally stops breathing, you get up and declare yourself the new leader of the Crimson Talons. <EOS>
<BOS> You throw a punch at Klint’s face, which probably hurts your hand more than it hurts his face. Still, it’s enough to cause him to reel back a bit and drop his knife. <EOS>
<BOS> You approach the bedside to assess the Seth’s wounds. A large bloodstained bandage is bound across his chest. A similar one is wrapped around his bicep. His normally clean-shaven face has a light beard. Funny, you always assumed he shaved his face bare because he couldn’t grow a beard like the rest of King Aeric’s men. His two short swords hang, sheathed, on a chair nearby. Seth’s eyes are closed, and the rest of his face shows signs of dampness. Cold sweat. Not a good sign for a man recovering from battle wounds. <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, not in the traditional sense no. I mean any damage they do cause is mostly confined to on stage and going to be minor compared to the crowd they bring in. However, they do have some rather interesting theatrics on stage. It’s part of why people like to watch them.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Nothing. Just still hoping you know what you're doing." Zal remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> You stomp upstairs and meet Zal in your bedroom. You then close the door. <EOS>
<BOS> You shake your head. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh wait, I’m supposed to go to the school of magic, not medicine. Duh. Apologies.” You say trying not to laugh while everyone calls you names. <EOS>
<BOS> “More important than coin? Wow, you really do care about me.” <EOS>
<BOS> She can tell you’re obviously feeling ill effects and finishes you off before she possibly inadvertently kills you. <EOS>
<BOS> “You hear…ulp!” Zal says and then before your eyes a scaled green claw covers her mouth and another holds a dagger to her throat. You also notice a long tail wrapped around one of her legs and a pair of glinting reptilian eyes shine behind her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. Well I was going to suggest that we make our base there. I mean regardless of what they do in the city, the Jicol Watch are definitely not going to harass us out there, but I’m not sure if I want to do that if it was a temple dedicated to Fel.” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s at that moment Brother Samuel notices a break in the summoning circle. Ragar the Unbroken strides through the magic seals, gazing intently on Samuel. The monk begins to draw on the magic infused in his cane, but Ragar is quicker. Shadow magic fills the air cutting Brother Samuel’s ability to breathe. The magic hangs heavy as if the monk is dragged further and further underwater. <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t say that, and I’m going to address something else. While I know its unfortunate that my…ugh… condition has made you more drawn to me, you need to fucking snap out of it. It’s been two years and even those I work with closely don’t behave this way around me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera, I told you, the curse doesn’t work like that. You could die tomorrow or even a month from now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, he who burns brighter than the sun and shows the way of peace.” <EOS>
<BOS> As he falls, his comrade has already turned and ran, but you fire off another shot as soon as you stand back up and land a hit to the back of his skull. <EOS>
<BOS> The simple thing would be to shoot him and get this over with since you’re fairly sure the rest are going to fall in line, but you’ll make greater point by actually humoring this asshole. Besides, he’s annoyed you enough that you’ll take some delight in kicking his ass. <EOS>
<BOS> “Foolish mortal, you could have gotten yourself killed.” Tanya growls and then with you in her arms, she takes flight back out the window. You look down on the city from the sky and it’s a surreal feeling. You might even appreciate it if you weren’t in a lot of pain right now. <EOS>
<BOS> The addict stand around gawking for a moment, but then quickly realize they should go get their free drugs and run inside the house, leaving you to head over to Rook’s place. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah, like you’d get him to climb up on rooftops, let alone jumping from them nowadays.” <EOS>
<BOS> Unsurprisingly the pair of them have shadow magic powers. However you anticipated that which why you had Grayhaze enchant something that would at least even up the odds. A ring. Not quite an anti-magic field, but something to dull the shadow magic around you. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh," one says shrewdly, realizing his hidden meaning. "We can watch her, but could use a little coin for the inconvenience. 30 silver." <EOS>
<BOS> “What if nobody comes?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey. I remember you. You’re Garrick’s friend. Guess you’re the one he sent to contact me.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Klint on the other hand turns to you with a face that’s now completely drained of all its rage and is a little shock himself. <EOS>
<BOS> Lorthander stands in the opening to the great hall, leaning against his gnarled staff. The Unbroken wills your body to meet him. <EOS>
<BOS> You remove the glass and grab the crown. No sooner have you picked it up and that’s when you feel an unnatural chill in the air and you’re struck by a powerful vision. <EOS>
<BOS> “Would have been better had that not ever happened. Just made things worse, sort of like you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t know. He appears in a mist of black smoke with gnarled staff at his side. He leans on it, always, because his back is crunched like he’s caring a heavy burden. A dark hood covers his face. His voice is otherworldly, it’s like a projection from behind the veil.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I – a caged bird.” she offers. <EOS>
<BOS> “This is a Traveling Map,” he explains, handing it to you. “Open it when you want to instantly travel between any two points you have already been to. You’ll note that the Village and your House (what’s left of them anyway), and my Armory are already on the map – as well as a fourth location to the north, labeled Stronghold. <EOS>
<BOS> "Deal," you accept his terms - it is still more than double what you paid for it - and take the silver. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well what do we have here?” A voice exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I, as well, have a concern," another man steps forward, this one with the crest of a Master Mage. "Storytellers are tawdry and depraved charlatans, not to be trusted. It would be better to have him clapped in iron, or thrown to your snakes, than have him give a tale here, in your very throneroom!" <EOS>
<BOS> You scramble back to your feet, but you’re in a very bad position. You’re trapped in a narrow corridor with people shooting at you behind and ahead. Even with your skills, you have no cover and you soon take a couple shots that put you down. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not really religious so no.” <EOS>
<BOS> Soon several of his fellows come and get you and the couple. They grab you first since they rightly seem to believe you’re the biggest threat. You exit the carriage and see some dead horses with bolts in them which no doubt contributed to the carriage crashing. The driver and the extra protector are nowhere to be seen, though you assume were killed before or after the crash. <EOS>
<BOS> There on it’s left side you see what the problem is. In all the ensuing the chaos, the horse actually took a few crossbow bolts. Probably damage to vital organs and its adrenaline is finally wearing off. Bad luck for you and even worse luck for the horse. Not having many more options, you start walking. <EOS>
<BOS> You get a couple of blocks and suddenly you feel like you’re being watched. You start to look around, but nobody is around. You quicken your pace and a couple seconds later, you feel a crossbow in your back. <EOS>
<BOS> A gunshot is heard as you’re trying to flee causing you to instinctively duck, though due to your dizziness, you end up tripping and falling. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait….you’ve never?” <EOS>
<BOS> "One of those charmed fools just lit a fucking powder keg below deck! This ship is going down! Come on, help me to the emergency rowboat! I saw a patch of land to the north!" Rifiv shouts before he stumbles to the floor of the ship. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay then. If this is the last thing that needs to be done for us to be together then let’s do it. I mean it’s the least I can do after all the shit I did anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, and she’s going to be giving me the evil eye the entire time. Thinking I’m going to steal something.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Bunch of fucking poseurs. And of course none of them got two gold coins to their name.” You mutter as you go through the pittance you managed to steal. <EOS>
<BOS> “Here. Take this thing and leave me be.” She says and hands you back your pistol. In all the ensuing mayhem you completely forgot that you had potentially lost your favorite weapon. <EOS>
<BOS> You don't relish sharing a room with a mage, especially considering the potential coin their stupid edict is costing you, but is a blood priestess any better? She is no doubt devout to the blood gods, and could be as dangerous as she is beautiful. <EOS>
<BOS> You wait for a little while expecting something, but just silence. You’re a little on edge as it is, so you fall back to mild churlishness. <EOS>
<BOS> But her fondness for your blood only grows, and a week in she is skipping the wine entirely, choosing to drink directly from your wrists or neck like a vampire. She doesn't have the teeth for it, of course, but the blood priesthood has some special ointment that allows the blood to flow through skin. She repays you with a bit of bloodwine in turn, enough to keep you from feeling faint, but you are relieved when her yacht finally docks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Actually, yes," you say, swallowing your fear. "I do need to be getting back to my Pilgrimage. I'm not a young man." <EOS>
<BOS> “You think they’ll go for it?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Vaughn told me he saw you laughing and talking to a pretty blonde dressed in colorful clothing with a mandolin strapped to her back. Naturally I came out here to see who this bitch was who had obviously captured your attention." Zal says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well...a lot of time has passed and that sheriff who hated you is long dead now. Klint's father also isn't there anymore, so I think you're in the clear legally, but I wouldn't exactly say you're wanted if you know what I mean. Though Annah apparently still thinks highly of you." <EOS>
<BOS> You close the door and think on who he could have been talking about. Your dad? Dad’s not a big guy though and you honestly doubt if he would bother to come look for you. <EOS>
<BOS> "Just say it," he whispers back. "You're a storyteller. I know." <EOS>
<BOS> You draw your weapon. <EOS>
<BOS> "I - " he sits upright, dropping the last piece of fruit into his lap, "I did not think of that! Could the mage ban on stories be what is leading to our own undoing?" He twists his cheek in shock and awe. "I will need to bring this before the council of mages. If they will even listen to me." He sighs. "I'm Novo Fogrill," he introduces himself to change the subject. <EOS>
<BOS> “Great. I’ll start letting my pirate contacts know that we’re in the slave trade business. Word will spread and I can’t wait to get started!” <EOS>
<BOS> “The hell I don’t! Why does it matter if you stay here anyway? I mean you’ve hinted on occasion in the past that you don’t really find this life as appealing anymore. So why not get out? You should be thanking me! I’m giving you a rare opportunity to walk away from a criminal organization and not even asking for anything in return.” <EOS>
<BOS> You think about it at first wondering if you should go through with it. Then you think that that’s pretty much why you came here in the first place and it would be good to finally rid yourself of all of Tanya’s “presence” even if you were fond of her. Plus now this sounds even less risky than it did before. <EOS>
<BOS> "Where the hell are Carl and Annie? I haven't seen either of those losers for days. Did they still want jobs at this place? Because I can easily get any slob to replace what they do. And in Carl's case that ain't much to begin with." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I will tell you something that only your village elder knew,” the old wizard resumes, taking a more friendly tone once again. <EOS>
<BOS> While the rest of her has changed drastically, you’d never forget her face. <EOS>
<BOS> “Couldn’t do that.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, you know who she is?” <EOS>
<BOS> Warts stands still for a moment moving his head as if to hear the sound he heard again, then all of a sudden… <EOS>
<BOS> At first you think briefly that it’s the guardian museum and it’s followed you, but it turns out to be a more tangible enemy instead. <EOS>
<BOS> Brother Samuel hadn’t told anyone of the shade's appearance, except for the Grandmaster himself. Deep down, the shade’s interest in the boy frightened him. He had the feeling it wouldn’t be the last appearance to the boy. The boy’s past is a mystery, and ordinarily he would have been turned away from the monastery. Though he didn’t show it, Brother Samuel could tell the Grandmaster took special interest in the boy as well. Samuel knew the Grandmaster before he earned the title. Only the Master of Archives could share the same boast. <EOS>
<BOS> Since it seems like a good time to boost your ranks you agree to meet though you do it on your own territory since you’re not fool enough to meet with a shadow priest with no back up. <EOS>
<BOS> “I got a roommate that take classes over here and she needed me to help her move her big ass painting. Looks like she just vomited paint all over a white board, but I guess that’s what gets you an A around here. As for Checkers, she’s safely asleep at my place. So talent search huh? What’s that all about?” <EOS>
<BOS> At this point you’re genuinely angry. Under normal circumstances, you’d probably just completely disengage, but seeing as you’re still aroused, you decide to give into Vera’s obvious kink. <EOS>
<BOS> "Maybe we shouldn't risk our lives on this. It would be kind of tragic to get this far only to get brought down at the finish line." Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> "I am a humble storyteller, on a Pilgrimage to the Sacred Grove of the Muses. I have heard your camel caravan is the finest to cross the Crimson Desert, and would request passage with the one that leaves tomorrow." <EOS>
<BOS> “Given that she’s hanging out with the likes of you, I find that hard to believe, but when she comes here tonight, bring her by the office. I’ll make a final decision then.” <EOS>
<BOS> Then, embracing her, you feel a strong power well from deep inside, reserves of magic you have never consciously called upon. The color from her drains, entering into you, and she disintegrates into deep green dust. <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile Vera’s gotten a little tipsier and a whole lot flirtier. <EOS>
<BOS> An unseen force pulls your body in the air as if a rope was tied around your waist. The room bursts with light. Magic lamps lining the walls turn on, filling the room with their crimson glow. Your body floats up higher, then shifts vertical allowing you to see. Seth’s body lies unmoving on the floor, a large boulder rests on his lower half. You’re in an armory. Shelves of swords, battle axes, spears, and shields span the entire room. Your eyes scan the room for the unseen assailant. They find a gnarled staff, a wrinkled hand gripping it tightly. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t have time for this, and don’t you got some work to do?” <EOS>
<BOS> He doesn’t even say anything he just lets go of the horse reins and elbows you in the face though it isn’t enough to drop the firearm. He then attempts to take his blunderbuss back. <EOS>
<BOS> As she sits across from you, she says nothing. She just stares. Or at least you assume she’s staring at you, you can’t see her eyes. <EOS>
<BOS> Tears pool at the corners of your eyes, but you clutch the staff for strength. It is far more certain of its purpose than you are of the path you have chosen. <EOS>
<BOS> “Nah, I actually know of a priest who’s perfect for this. So do we have a deal?” <EOS>
<BOS> Of course you could just try to help Tanya in the more traditional way and try to backstab him. Still not ideal, but if you miss, you’re not likely to hit Tanya by accident. <EOS>
<BOS> "If it must be so," you sigh, color rippling over her one last time, and a lock of her real hair brushing your cheek. You cut it, before it can harden once more. "Goodbye, my love." <EOS>
<BOS> Of course you could just resign yourself to your fate for now and look for an opportunity later. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…I hear you there. I admit we’ve all sort of gotten lazy about that over the years. I remember when I first joined I was one of the best cat burglars here. As things slowly deteriorated, guess I just said fuck it. So what else you think needs changing around here?” Zalmora asks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Heh, well you're right on that one. I actually appreciate the honesty. However, I've never really known Vaughn to step up and speak so favorably of someone. I mean I understand you guys had something once, but Vaughn's not one to stick his neck out and tends to play things safe. I have to believe he must be telling the truth to some degree. I mean you can't be a complete idiot." <EOS>
<BOS> “Never knew you were such a supporter of our dear ruler. You secretly harboring royalist admiration?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh?” <EOS>
<BOS> “STILL ALIVE THIEF? YOU ARE STRONGER THAN YOU LOOK.” <EOS>
<BOS> “And why would we leave Jicol alone?” <EOS>
<BOS> “What I don’t understand is why you came so clean with everything. I mean given the haul you brought in, I wasn’t even going to bother asking you too many in depth questions.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re here! I didn’t expect to see you so soon after the last time you inspected this place. I would have doubled the work time on it!” Madeline beams. You get the impression that she nearly was going to hug you, but stopped herself. <EOS>
<BOS> “And I trust you aren’t going to speak of this.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “He’s into guys. Thought that was obvious.” <EOS>
<BOS> Lusang, the second, switched the food his horses ate and monitored their intake, believing that lighter horses would run faster. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re right about Jicol of course, but that’s another reason why this isn’t going to be as dangerous as you believe. While Jicol certainly has enough ships to still look impressive, I don’t think you’ve been around lately to know what condition their fleet is truly in. They’ve had to forego their expensive upkeep and in some cases even downsize their crews. Jicol’s small flotilla is a hollow version of its former self.” <EOS>
<BOS> However, that doesn’t last and she inevitably starts complaining when you insist on staying off the road and sticking to the woods to keep out of sight of any potential person from Teckleville that might be tracking you. <EOS>
<BOS> Apparently Keira prefers being outdoors hunting even when she doesn’t need to, even sleeping outside under the stars at times rather than coming home. She says that sometimes she’d like to travel, but she says she’s never quite had the nerve to do it. She’s not sure why exactly seeing as there isn’t much to tie her here except Ardan though once again she doesn’t speak much more about him. <EOS>
<BOS> Heather is just shaking her head the whole time and then turns to you with a smile. <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t, he paid me to deliver a package to someone. I didn’t even know what was in it, until the guards confiscated it. Hell, I didn’t even know about the Ebony Claw Syndicate!” <EOS>
<BOS> You and Vaughn both look at Zalmora. <EOS>
<BOS> “Bard position? We didn’t…wait a minute. What does she look like?” <EOS>
<BOS> "I'll be traveling with the head made," he laughs, darkly, "that's even better, isn't it?" <EOS>
<BOS> Your eyes immediately widen and your whole body tenses up. <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, you’re drawing a crowd and you’ve had enough experience to know that’s never a good thing. You quickly make your escape away from the crowd, especially when you hear more shouting coming towards your position. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, maybe it is, but at least we’re just trying to make our money back from said deadbeat as opposed to snatching some hapless girl off the streets.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, you don’t look like you have. You look more like someone from a small town…say you wouldn’t be from Teckleville would you? That is the closest town around here.” <EOS>
<BOS> You briefly wonder if you should go back to your headquarters to check if there is anyone there, but really it’s still better to just get the hell out as quickly as possible. Besides, the Nocturnal League has practically got to be dead here now. Might as well move on to your back up plan, which is to head to Jicol. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey! Where youz tryin’ to get to?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Not today, probably not ever. I shall learn to live with this weakness and I’ll refocus my energy into other worthy endeavors. Fucking men and leading them astray isn’t something I find all that appealing anyway. Besides, you’re human and your kind have pitifully short life spans. You’ll live, what? Sixty more years at most and in your case of being a professional criminal, it is doubtful you’ll live to old age. Then after you’re dead, there will be no more weakness. I can be patient. It’s a good trait for an infernal anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Five thousand gold pieces for the tavern." Wendy says. <EOS>
<BOS> You and Vera take a moment to sort of absorb the fact of where you actually are for a moment. The seat of rulership, the palace! The grounds are certainly well taken care of and it’s obvious that every effort has been spared to make it look as festive as possible. <EOS>
<BOS> In fact you just hope you’ll actually survive to see her again, or hell just survive period. While Heather did reassure you of some of your concerns, there is still an invasion to “look forward to.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So I’ve heard. Oh I’ve heard a lot about you actually. Don’t know everything about you of course, but that’s okay, a little mystery is always welcome. What do you say about mystery?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, it’s general a religion that preaches peace and shit.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So…what then? You’re going to go with Wart’s idea?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Me?” <EOS>
<BOS> You suddenly know immediately what Vera is engaged in. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not a fan of it. I sort of prefer to know everything I can, so I’m not caught off guard.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What’s so funny?” Annah asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh I assure you human, I’m fully aware of my powers, but placing curses? Not my style and never will be. I learned a long time ago, even when I was here in my last remaining years tethered to this world that I enjoy direct bloodshed.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Not so eager to die now eh? Where's your Joachim now?" You sneer and easily end her life with a dagger to her throat. <EOS>
<BOS> “I am! You don’t expect me to do it fer free do ya? Come on, give a hob halfbreed a break. The place is ripe fer the pluckin’ an best of all ya don’t have ta worry if its Ebony Claw territory.” <EOS>
<BOS> Mr. Reynolds laughs, and you make a mental note that you're NEVER going to take out any sort of loan from this place no matter what the circumstances. <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re walking home you notice that the new owner of Saltwater Supplies are still routinely closing up shop at the same time to go make their prayers to Yag. You think next time you come this way; you’re going to have to pay the store a little visit. While they’ve gone to prayer of course. <EOS>
<BOS> Just a few paces away from Gwen with her sword in hand, she manages to stop herself from trampling over her. She snorts and turns a scowling face towards you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure. I mean yeah without them then the place might be a little more lawless like it was in the past, but nowadays? You’re just as safe from getting mugged there as you would in Klyton. Hell, maybe even more so given that Klyton has the Crimson Talons running around.” <EOS>
<BOS> “She betrayed me.” <EOS>
<BOS> Those words are the last you hear before everything goes black forever. <EOS>
<BOS> “No! Wait!” Zal says before you push her aside and sprint towards Jake fully intent on revenge. Unfortunately Vaughn and Zal shout at you to stop, which gives Jake enough warning to turn around. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t play dumb with me, acolyte. You may not know it, but we have watchful eyes everywhere. I’ve seen you flow through the forms flawlessly.” <EOS>
<BOS> So things are going good for the Nocturnal League and business couldn’t be better. You haven’t had any decisions of the major kind lately, but for whatever reason this has caused you to sometimes over think the minor ones now that do crop up. <EOS>
<BOS> You and Tanya spend the rest of your time talking about her plan. It’s actually fairly simple. She tells you to go back to Rook and report everything you know about the Guild. Location and everything. She says when your information pans out to be true, and what remains of the Guild is destroyed then you’ll be in the Ebony Claw with no problems and from that point onward, you can tell relay vital information which she can use. <EOS>
<BOS> “Please, you have to stop this!” she says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because I gotta look after shit around here. I just can’t drop everything to go rip off a store. I’m not Tom, I don’t just sit on my ass doing nothing.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Goodbye Tanya.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, that’s on the east side, I’m talking about the west side. There’s a statue of a physician wearing a plague mask.” <EOS>
<BOS> Fuck it, why not? Maybe it’s time for a change. <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno. I mean the plan with the merchant ship sounds okay, but I’m not sure if I want to pay out any more coin for pirate assistance. Also I don’t see them lasting too long against the Jicol navy and that seems like a waste.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, yeah I considered that, but considering some of their story has already been confirmed as true, I’m finding it a little easier to believe an organization that has made no pretenses of being pissed with me than a woman who is obviously more mentally unstable than I ever could have known. And they already turned us against each other when you agreed to deal with them! Either you’re so delusional that you believed working with the ECS would somehow bring us together, and I’m really struggling to believe you’re that stupid, or you’re just lying about everything. At this point either one wouldn’t surprise me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m taking my share. I figure since I saved our asses tonight, that entitles me to a lot more.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, well glad to see you have some sense at least from a pragmatic standpoint, which is more than can be said for those fools on the Klyton Council. Though there’s currently a man running for a spot on there. He seems to be more in favor of relaxing the magic restrictions in this city. I might actually vote for him. Anyway you said had a curse or some such bother?” <EOS>
<BOS> Zal then looks down a bit, sighs and then finishes her goodbye. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, as you correctly guessed I will be leaving tonight. As for telling mom and dad, I thought about it…but I can only imagine the chaos that might cause with mom getting weepy and dad forbidding me to go anywhere. Hell, he might actually have the town guard throw me in jail just so I’d have to stay! No, better just leave a note and take off in the middle of the night.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, the Baroness has always been a dabbler. Her faith in Fel isn’t the most dedicated. Indeed she probably has always been more interested in learning shadow magic rather than revering Fel. Still, it was useful to have ruler that was friendly towards us. Unfortunately the new Dornan leadership seems have opened their own doors to teaching the ways of magic and Ludmilla is all too eager to jump on such an offer even if it means paying lip service to both gods.” <EOS>
<BOS> Your mom on the other hand as you’re hastily grabbing a few items, is tearfully going on about how you (And your sister) wasted your potential and she doesn’t know where she and your father went wrong. <EOS>
<BOS> "But what's wrong with him? Is he sick?" <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re not sure if your life as a rogue is over, but it certainly has taken a very different turn. <EOS>
<BOS> Graham looks a little impressed by your basic knowledge of the political landscape. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m really not trying to be disrespectful boss, but it seems like we can just pick up the pieces after all this is over. If anything we’ll be in a stronger position since the populace won’t be in any condition to oppose us and it’ll take awhile before the new ruler imposes any sort of order. And this Peter is another Varsakken right? He’s probably not going to be any better than his sister, so it’ll be business as usual.” <EOS>
<BOS> You continue down the road and once again you see something out of the ordinary. This time though it’s a hanging cage along side the road. <EOS>
<BOS> "Because I already own the place in all but name already. Look, the place was barely making any money to before I showed up and now that you know the truth, you won't want to have any more connection to the place. So I'm making you a generous offer since you're an old family friend to buy it. Two thousand gold pieces. You know that this is the best offer you're going to get and let's be honest, you don't have a choice. What are you going to do? Report us to the militia? We'll be gone...or at least I won't be around and all that's going to happen is the city of Klyton is going to arrest your children and seize the place, leaving you with no steady income whatsoever." <EOS>
<BOS> “Jicol huh? Yeah I guess I can take you along, but not for free obviously.” The trader says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya, I’ve been having dreams about you for past few months ever since everything that went down with the Neroth cultists. Now I dunno if you’re doing it on purpose or what, but these dreams have been more than just dreams, it’s like…it’s like they’re real somehow. You’re talking to me. WE’RE talking to each other about, well everything. My past, your past, our likes, our dislikes. I swear it’s like we’ve been dating without actually going out.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I…but…she couldn’t… I mean I would have known… by the gods…” <EOS>
<BOS> You look up from your position and focus on Tanya. She’s changed physically again. Her wings are bigger for one thing (you called that one) and now her skin has a reddish hue. If you didn’t know better, you’d think her eyes were going to burn a hole in you with how she’s staring at you. Reminds of the old days when she used to get pissed at you, though she never slammed you this hard into a wall before. <EOS>
<BOS> "I can't believe you're the same woman I met over a decade ago." <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s not what I mean, I just…(Sigh) look I know you don’t listen to mom or dad, but I’ve been thinking they’ve got a point. I mean, what am I doing? What are WE doing? I mean when we were little kids, this was fun. Working together in near perfect harmony and avoiding trouble, but we’re both sixteen now. We really going to be doing this for another sixteen years?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I know! I know! I should have told you sooner, but it seemed cowardly in a letter and I felt I should at least tell you in person! I know you’re not fond of slavery, but the location and demand was too good to pass up in Jicol. I’d be a fool if I didn’t excel in something I was skilled in.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Before you can answer, another man chimes in. “It’s just tribal nonsense. They pray to the earth and worship the sun. I bet the ‘demon’ is nothing more than a rogue sorcerer taking refuge in the ruins.” <EOS>
<BOS> "And ONLY if she likes it -" <EOS>
<BOS> If your time here hasn’t changed history before, it certainly has now, because your family as you know it, is dead. You sort of expect yourself to blink out of existence, but that doesn’t happen. You don’t know why, but maybe it doesn’t work like that because you’re still in the past. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, there always problems that crop up in your line of work. Nothing that can be done to eliminate that. <EOS>
<BOS> Scales’ moves forward a bit with Zal still in his clutches. His eyes briefly stare at the egg and then fixate on you again. You can’t tell if he’s angry or what, all you do know is his stare doesn’t put you at ease. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, if I ask my dad for help and I get too much from him as it is…anyway I might very well get a job, but I’m not actually going to work. You’re probably not aware, but women don’t exactly populate the field and tends to be an old boy’s club. As a result it doesn’t matter how high my grades are, I’m never going to get a project where I’m actually going to be involved in any meaningful way. At best I’d just be kept around so guys stare at my tits all day. If I were a dwarf, it wouldn’t matter what gender I was. (Sigh) Humanity sucks sometimes.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> When you exit, you find that you’re not too far from Hell’s Own Inn, so you get back there as soon as possible since you think you need to reconsider an option you were given earlier. <EOS>
<BOS> "What the fuck Vaughn, don't put me in the same category as that weathered corpse!" Zal exclaims suddenly getting angry. <EOS>
<BOS> Even at this early hour, there are a few people milling about. Several gardeners, extracting the weeds or binding the bushes into shape; a pair of moonstruck lovers; a little girl half-buried in the frills of a cupcake like dress, and her father pushing her wooden wheel-chair along the cobbled path; and a couple old woman with binoculars watching the birds; and a travelling merchant setting up by a fountain, wearing a giant pack on his back from which peek decorated silks and beaded parasols. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not sleeping down here on the ground. What if something wanders by before I can properly react? I’ll be in a tree so I can at least be somewhat out of immediate sight.” <EOS>
<BOS> “He’s into guys. Thought that was obvious.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You seem to know a lot of about this, why is that exactly?” you say once again moving towards Gertrude. <EOS>
<BOS> Suddenly a dagger comes short of severing the finger from your hand while the woman reaches over the table to grab you by your shirt. She’s a lot stronger than she would appear since you’re partially yanked out of your seat towards her. <EOS>
<BOS> You move on to pondering what your plans are today. While you gave most of the stash to Annah, you can easily live on what you have left for a month before you even need to go out again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I understand. Still holding a candle for her huh? Y’know, anytime I saw you two together she was bitching at you. If you ask me, you seem like you’re better off anyway.” Randi says. <EOS>
<BOS> “So, Mr. ideas, what exactly were you going to bring up to Tom as far as changes and such?” Zal asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I bind her of course.” Flynn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Zal looks at you for a moment in silence. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I suppose nobody will suddenly catch me talking to you, that’s for sure. Anyway, it’s done.” <EOS>
<BOS> Still, if you take out Peter then it isn’t like you’re going to have to worry about him ever trying this in another five to ten years and having to deal with it again. <EOS>
<BOS> You sit with Vera’s body for a moment saddened that this was necessary at all. You wipe your own eyes and eventually stand up and compose yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> "A honeycomb," you nod. "A fine choice." The honeycomb often was a symbol of idealism, or of reward through hard work. But what would a princess in a garden do with a honeycomb? <EOS>
<BOS> “Well yeah, but demon didn’t come to mind, but so what? I don’t care, I want to get to know her…” <EOS>
<BOS> However, you soon wish you hadn’t. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, and?” you prod. <EOS>
<BOS> Plus that temple could very well be used for other things. <EOS>
<BOS> You furrow your brow, unsure of what to say. Ivani had cared for the humans - but, come to think of it, her care for others than yourself had been the same tenderness she showed her animals and plants. And though she did not speak of it often, she had dropped references to ancient wars, and to Sandman's bitterness against the humans. It was why you had kept the truth of your marriage hidden from muse and human alike, Ivani pretending to be a simple flower farmer whenever you visited Dreaming Village. <EOS>
<BOS> “Now hol…” you start to say before you feel a boot kicking you in the side of the head. <EOS>
<BOS> You and Annah both turn around to see three men bigger than you. Not by much, but certain enough that three of them are more than you’d be able to handle with just a short sword. In fact you recognize them as the ones that you were just telling Annah about. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wow. You look, really different.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera, I’m not going to start choking you. I practically feel like I’m killing you already.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Gloom might have mentioned it. He never elaborated and what you were talking about with her, but I get the impression he didn’t know and just feared a power grab and wanted to strike first before you had the whole city worshipping Dorna.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> You are Raven of Riverwood village, a small community of woodcutters on the edge of Serpentfang Forest. The edge of the forest is a relatively safe place – at least compared to the deeper parts of the forest’s old growth. Lots of dangerous monsters lurk in there, especially giant spiders. Interestingly enough, there aren’t any snakes. Some folks say the name of the forest isn’t a reference to snakes at all, but rather to a giant dragon that ravaged the lands hundreds of years ago. <EOS>
<BOS> “So what are you getting at?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I feel like that was directed at me.” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s too damn early in the morning to deal with this, so you decide not to and just go over to the carriage and climb up to where the driver is. He nods and greets you. <EOS>
<BOS> You look up from the bar ready to tell whoever it is to get the hell out and that's when you see a face that you could never forget no matter how much time has passed. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck!” you shout, only narrowly dodging the statue’s swing at your head. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fired? Wait…really?” Vera says suddenly coming to the understanding of your words very quickly. <EOS>
<BOS> Predictably this enrages him and he swings wildly at you with his knife, you easily dodge his clumsy attacks and with a few punches to his face, he’s already on the ground. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re looking around for stairs to the cellar, you hear some thumping coming from the upstairs. Things have been more or less silent so far, so this it cause to give you alarm. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I sort of got forced into that situation. Before that, my twin sister and I used to steal from travelling merchants in Teckleville all the time before she left to pursue her dreams of being a bard. Worked with my girlfriend after that, but she wasn’t quite as good at it…you know the rest.” <EOS>
<BOS> “There is, but think about it. I mean this is your home, there’s no business conducted here or at least not in the direct sense. That demon is probably going to hit our Blue Dream Houses, our brothels, whatever businesses we’re collecting protection on and what about that brand new slave market that opened up in the old Thieves Guild?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Which part?" You ask humoring this asshole. <EOS>
<BOS> “I will.” <EOS>
<BOS> Percy laughs out loud. <EOS>
<BOS> "(Sigh) No. I'm not fucking Annie. That's an ugly rumor that delusional bitch probably started in the first place. I can see I'm going to have to set her ass straight." <EOS>
<BOS> “Then the predictions came true. Elder Flynn was correct in predicting that eventually your group would get involved and side with what’s left of the worshippers of Fel. He also predicted that such an alliance would result in your side’s victory. So with that in mind, I don’t believe the Elder would have any more to speak on the matter. The Joachimites will be destroyed. The Felians will be in no condition to do anything to us assuming they survive at all and your organization will be so weakened that even if you were any sort of rival to us, you wouldn’t be able to do anything either.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose. But it’s one thing to love someone despite them being say a thief. It’s quite another to love someone who has committed genocide on a whole populace.” <EOS>
<BOS> You crawl the best you can from out under Daniel’s body and swing your blade at anyone coming near, but it’s no use. There are just too many and despite hacking a couple of them at the legs, they soon begin stomping and kicking you. <EOS>
<BOS> “I know, that’s why I got us out of that situation by bluffing that you had a gun. I’d think you’d be grateful that I’m so quick on my feet.” <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t reply. <EOS>
<BOS> The creature inside almost looked human - was he human? A grown man, it seemed, was trying to escape from the egg! His skin was tinted blue, and he had no hair. <EOS>
<BOS> "I suppose. He mentioned you might be getting restless. I'll arrange it." <EOS>
<BOS> You stick to the woods figuring that it will provide you with more cover. You keep alert for possible denizens that lurk in the woods themselves, but besides a lot of birds and a few normal animals, you don’t encounter anything out of the ordinary. You even manage to get a good night’s sleep, well as good as you can get with as paranoid as you are. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s pretty presumptuous that you won’t, after I’m done.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yep, and better yet, it’s one of those multiple shooty things.” You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> “Warts, what the hell, you should know better than to run up on me like that! Why are you following me anyway?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I can see this craziness is catching. I’m leaving before I catch it too. See you later, assuming Scales doesn’t eat you, and Zal, I would think that you’d know better than to even entertain this idea.” Vaughn remarks and walks away. <EOS>
<BOS> “Dat’s becuz there’s no organizations anymore. Without da Syndicate or even the Guild around, the criminal element here is easy pickin’ for da guvment. No need to appease or even profit from them. Easier ta just execute or toss ‘em in prison.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah, don’t flatter yourself. I just want a quick tumble and I don’t feel like finding myself some rent boy or dealing with Jake’s usual asshole behavior right now. Plus, you’re young and a lot less repulsive…hey are you a virgin?” Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera kisses you goodbye to go perform her regular duties and get things rolling on the Black Hooks situation. <EOS>
<BOS> "No, because as you have already pointed out, this isn't your fault at all and I don't trust Vaughn to not fuck it up, so I'll do it myself." <EOS>
<BOS> The Dornan Temple doesn’t even have their usual lookout standing outside, though you imagine the Dornans have some sort of magical detection going on and this plan has already been expected. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, we’re going to Klyton…” <EOS>
<BOS> “N…” is all he gets out before you outdraw him and put three in his face. Meanwhile marco has killed the elf captain with a shot to the back of his head making his armor useless. <EOS>
<BOS> “Watch it there, treasonous words. Though any particular reason why you haven’t?” <EOS>
<BOS> Then not five minutes later after leaving the brothel you’re attacked on the street by three thugs catching you slipping. <EOS>
<BOS> “Really? Would have thought all you had to do is kick people around.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Revenge?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Actually I was thinking more about the why.” <EOS>
<BOS> Once again, Annah has a much better set up than you do. Not that you really care…okay maybe you’re curious, but you have to ask… <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t have much of a choice. I’m glad to see you’re still alive,” you respond. <EOS>
<BOS> “I know I’m right, I should reassign her.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Can I play with my shadow creatures dad?” Kol asks. <EOS>
<BOS> The next day you wake up. You feel some of the aches from yesterday’s events, but you’re not too bad off. You look and Tanya isn’t next to you and you expect her to be gone, but after looking around a bit, you see her standing by herself (still in her human form) over looking a small cliff by the sea. You walk over to her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Gladly.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay Mr. bossman, if you hadn’t initially taken my advice in the first place you wouldn’t even be in this position.” Zal says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I mean are you sure? I mean your belly isn’t big.” <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t reply, you just unload several bullets into his chest before he can even react. You then duck and roll to the side hoping that you’ll avoid getting hit by Bolt’s crossbow. <EOS>
<BOS> She tastes some of the blood and then pops the whole thing into her mouth. <EOS>
<BOS> Honestly you don’t really give a shit though. What is more telling is she’s admitting to it now meaning that she’s trying to admit a “lesser” offense to distract from a greater one she’s hiding. It’s one of the oldest criminal tricks in the book. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, that was a bit dark for me, but hell, no wonder the Syndicate is going to shit, if they’re backing down from a threat like that.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm. Well, I guess you did do your part. Almost makes up for the bumbling you did back at the museum. Anyway I highly recommend that YOU go home as soon as you can, I’m going to go report everything to the Guild.” <EOS>
<BOS> A month passes and eventually you get word from your agent in Klyton. She mentions that the Klyton magic school is barely better than the one in Holgard and the only main difference is they have a nicer looking school and tend to be more “scholarly” as opposed to “battle ready.” <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you get to the university and the medical school. Thankfully Dr. Gossey is in her office when you arrive. <EOS>
<BOS> They press you to stay longer, especially the priestess Lyria, who has seemed to grow attached to your stories - or to your blood, you aren't really sure where her real interest lies. But you insist - the long journey ahead cannot wait any longer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Dat’s Warts!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh come on, you could still go visit them. I mean this job…it’s legit right?” <EOS>
<BOS> So many questions... <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, and what if we are?” Metzger asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, are you seriously telling me I should lower my own fucking security? What the hell happens if the demon does strike here?!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Holgard is tricky to get to if you don’t know the way. Lot of false paths get made. Besides, you lot usually have more than enough gold. I see you humies travelling all over in your rolly boxes filled with goods.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you get to the simple home that the JCR was using as a main headquarters, you find that your people are currently arguing with some of the Jicol Watch. Great. <EOS>
<BOS> I guess you had more feelings for me than I thought, or maybe I’m just that good. But I hope it’s the first because that means you might be having strong feelings of betrayal right now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, REALLY friendly. Didn’t know it was going to be that kind of party. Guessing something was in the drinks. Glad I hadn’t drank anything while I was there. Still, I might have paired up with one of the horny aristocrat guys if it had just been a one on one thing, but then Ludmilla was around and she started hitting on me too and I got really creeped out. I mean she didn’t know of course, but she could potentially be my half sister, and that just really put me out of the mood entirely. I ran out as soon as I could.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, I grew up in a Joachim household. Didn’t take obviously, but still I don’t like hearing rumors of Neroth worshippers being in the city. I mean say what you want about Karn or even Fel, but they aren’t actively evil deities. Neroth is bad news man.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Think I’ve heard some of the Hessla pirates we deal with mention it sometimes. Don’t know much though.” <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately, those are the last thoughts you ever have. The cultists dragging you to the dungeon cell aren’t exactly being the most gentle and your already battered head takes a few more hits, then when they throw you in the cell, they give you a couple more kicks as well. You don’t feel the pain any longer since you’re unconscious by this point. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sis?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well I’m not sure if I’m quite convinced. I mean there are some things about your story that feel a little weak and I don’t have the luxury of interrogating Mr. Dream or Weaver, because you killed them both. All I got is your word and right now, that’s not much.” <EOS>
<BOS> probably not wrong about the Felians. <EOS>
<BOS> You manage to get a few minutes into it and you start to feel woozy. At first you just think that you’re just getting too much of a good thing too fast, but then your vision starts to get blurry. <EOS>
<BOS> “The Dornan high priestess or matriarch as her followers call her now, has made steps in meeting with Baroness Varsakken over the past few months. She obviously intends on gaining favor with Ludmilla and eventually get rid of us and that can’t happen.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah send her in right away.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I suppose so, she is drunk a lot of the time. But anyway, like I said, I’m trying to process the fact that I’m now wanted for murder. I don’t even know how I feel on THAT fact either. The actual murder. I mean I feel like maybe I should feel bad or something.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Mom? Dad? What are you both doing in my room?” he asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re still a little wary, but you pull out your little lock pick set and begin to work on the big lock. <EOS>
<BOS> You nod. "I'm going to the Grove of Muses." <EOS>
<BOS> You’re not going to be able to reason with her. She’s already proven she’s beyond that. Dismissing her isn’t going to work either. Not to mention she killed one of your productive members. Sure he was an idiot when it came to picking women obviously, but he still did his job and excelled in that area. <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera, I really don’t know what to say, except if you believe that I haven’t ever thought about us, well you don’t know me as well as you think. Hell, tonight I even enjoyed pretending a bit that we were going out on some fancy date, well until the drugged drinks that is.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So? You’re not the only one involved in doing this you know! You couldn’t just think about ME for once and steal some pretty items?” <EOS>
<BOS> Keira suddenly kisses you on the cheek and excitedly goes to pack. Since you’re a little tired from accidently killing your ancestor and all, you tell her you want to get some sleep and start the journey tomorrow. She agrees and continues to pack. <EOS>
<BOS> “The Laughing Devil isn’t that cheap, and far from being the shithole the Welcome Mat was so it’s not that frugal.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Can’t say I don’t blame him,” you say, taking a small sip from the tankard. The ale tingles on your tongue, bursting with a sweet, frothy flavor. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you make so many turns down various twisting narrow streets, the soldiers on horseback can’t effectively follow, but the new ones on foot that have been alerted continue the pursuit just fine. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh for fuck’s sake, if my sister had ANY attraction to you, she certainly would have showed it. She didn’t and now she’s GONE, okay? Get the hell over it already…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yinen? Haven’t seen him in days.” <EOS>
<BOS> You return to Hell’s Own and take the rest of the night off. Hopefully you can get a good price for the wine otherwise it really will have been all pretty pointless. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look here, you old fuck! This asshole just tried to kill me and it was self defense! But even if you don’t believe that then believe this, if I can do THAT to this fucker, I can do WORSE to your ass. You tell the fucking militia and I will fucking burn this shithole to the damn ground and everyone in it after ram my fist up your ass and tear out your damn spine!” you threaten. <EOS>
<BOS> You finish packing and are heading towards the escape hatch when the door is finally partially broken. A bullet whizzes by you and into the wall. You whirl around to fire your own flintlock at your assailants. You hit one, but then are shot yourself. It's only in the leg, but given how close you are to an open hatch, you fall back, slip and tumble down it. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point you succeed in making her angry again, she actually sits up and snatches her dagger out of the table and waves it at you. <EOS>
<BOS> “You made it back alive, so I’m guessing you were successful?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well I’ve heard things!” <EOS>
<BOS> “You don’t mean that,” you answer. <EOS>
<BOS> Then again, if she is getting friendly with the Baroness, is it really going to make a difference to you? And Heather did just come through for you on the Syndicate thing. <EOS>
<BOS> The man, Mordecai, looks around the room. His long hair tied behind his head melts into the top of the robe. You can tell he hasn’t shaved in quite some time, despite the lack of full beard. Even though he wears the same robe as Seth, the attire of King Aeric’s inner circle, his personal upkeep is well the opposite of the clean-cut Seth. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'll entertain the thought. What is it?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that won’t happen, so perhaps your luck is better than you think. Perhaps even Yaz is looking over you.” <EOS>
<BOS> What might have been you suppose, but then again who knows? You still hold out hope that you’ll get cured one day so the future isn’t set in stone yet. <EOS>
<BOS> “She wants to leave me after all I’ve fucking done for her! I taught her how to hunt better! I was by her side when her mother was dying! And fucking another man is how she repays me?” <EOS>
<BOS> Before you can go into some of your other ideas, Zalmora stops you with some of her own. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are they dead?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe so. I feel like he might have told someone first. Guess he might have been really scared though.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, but…argh…this is really…fuck it, let’s do this. I want those two summoned back here and tell them I’m ready to talk about a deal. I also want you to take Kol away from here and go to the armory or something with several of our best and wait until this is over.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Fine. I’ll do it.” The mayor says probably rethinking everything after what everything he’s seen. <EOS>
<BOS> “…no…” Layla says looking downward. <EOS>
<BOS> “Mr. Scars said a year’s worth.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I apologize for the inconvenience," the oldest among them speaks, "but we've ran out of options. With the death of the head mage..." <EOS>
<BOS> It doesn’t matter if it was an accident. It doesn’t matter that he just said she cheated on you with him (Which might’ve been a lie anyway). It doesn’t even matter that she’s bitching at you all the time and you were strongly considering leaving her soon anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> Finally, there is the group that you were expecting the most trouble from. <EOS>
<BOS> The bolt squarely hits your chest. Every instinct in your body screams for movement, to dodge, to evade the magic, but you’re no longer in control. Instead of tearing a hole through your chest, the shadow bolt hits your chest and fades like a drying puddle. <EOS>
<BOS> “I think it is. Guess I better inform Marco that his days at sea aren’t quite finished yet since he’ll be the one to take the merchant ship seeing as he’s got the most experience with it and nobody else here is much of a sailor.” <EOS>
<BOS> “On time as usual. Very glad that you value promptness as I am in a bit of a hurry. I believe I may have had too much fun here and I should be getting back. I thank you for your suggestions on where to go.” Percy says. <EOS>
<BOS> You tell your two people you’re going to take shelter in the temple and you all head inside. <EOS>
<BOS> After a brief discussion about sweeping up the remainder of the invasion force she finally turns her attention to you. Heather and the rest leave since they more work to do and Heather looks anxious to get out of there in the first place. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, she always returns to you excitedly going on about what she’s done and what she’s planning and everything else. When you meet in person, it’s always a special event (If literally draining). <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I am an old man son. In fact, I am well beyond my years. Two hundred and seventy seven years beyond to be exact. In this tower I am nigh immortal, but outside… well, time waits to collect its due from the likes of me. I can only travel outside my tower for a few minutes at a time with great focus. <EOS>
<BOS> You hate it when she makes sense. <EOS>
<BOS> “Annah, are you…oh right.” You say remembering she’s not here, which still seems odd. You sort of figured that maybe she’d sneak back in or something. <EOS>
<BOS> “No offense kid, but even if he didn’t have half our numbers with him and you had help I don’t think you could take Jake. Jake is the best fighter we have and he’s probably only gotten better since being out there. I’m not risking anyone in a foolish assassination attempt, let alone an internal conflict. Although…no…that’s not an option…” Tom says trailing off. <EOS>
<BOS> When you wake up, you’re in a cell, completely naked. A brief look at your surroundings and you know exactly where you are. It’s the torture chamber where you saved Naji. In fact, you’re in the exact same cell. <EOS>
<BOS> You nearly laugh thinking back at how Annah fooled that guard when you first got to Klyton with a bullshit story like that. You were probably about the same age as the couple when that happened. <EOS>
<BOS> “Never noticed, but no, I just got something important business to talk to Tom about.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Always, but I don’t understand why you don’t come on these things like you used to.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Tell me, do you think you could take them both?” he asks. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s been a weird night. Your encounter with Annah aside, you still haven’t fully processed the fact that you had to kill Klint’s father tonight. You aren’t quite sure how you feel about that, except better him than you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh it’s just an eatery run by a Halfling chef. He sells qweepa on a stick. Tastes pretty good from what I hear, but I’d never know because I’m reluctant to eat a damn rat. Still, halflings do have a reputation for making anything taste good, so maybe I should be adventurous some day.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera stop. Stop. Let’s talk about this. I apologize for calling you a bitch.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, just concerned about how reliable you’re going to be. If you’re genuinely interested in working for us or you’re just being a rebel against your real dad and mildly self-destructive.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe for me, never said anything about you. Your payment is AFTER the job is done. In fact, shouldn’t you just be standing guard outside my door?” <EOS>
<BOS> Long ago, in the Kingdom of Evervale, the middle princess would spend her days in the hanging gardens. But though she had endless mazes to play in and plenty of honey and cream to snack on, she was bored. There was everything to do, but it meant nothing. Whatever she desired, she could have, but once she had it, she no longer desired it. The princess was certain things could not continue in this way. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I don’t need details on that part.” <EOS>
<BOS> One of your tent-mates is inside, and he gestures for you to sit. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I mean why the fuck are we entering the sewers?” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re so talented. I’ll be so glad when we’re out of this city. I’m bored of it already. Come on, make me less bored.” Annah says and begins caressing and kissing on you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe the Nocturnal League by itself isn’t a threat, but YOU on the other hand…I dunno…you have a reputation. I mean while this all looks advantageous to us, something about letting you run off to an island while you plot and scheme away from our immediate attention, well that seems fairly dangerous. Maybe you can’t do anything to us now, but who can say in the years to come? It’s best to keep and eye on you.” <EOS>
<BOS> "And I'm Madam Zao." <EOS>
<BOS> It's hard to remember much of anything. <EOS>
<BOS> “An example had to be made and you lot were the strongest. The sad fact of life is our kind only ever really respond to is fear and strength, so this was entirely necessary.” <EOS>
<BOS> "It will be again and in time when we get a few more recruits and things are running smoothly we can do the same thing with another place." <EOS>
<BOS> “So…you still in those dorms?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Heh, and I knew that about you too! Maybe you’re not so mysterious, but that’s okay too!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Not yet, you mean. There are always others.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Hey I'm still quick, you saw me leap over that bar didn't you?" <EOS>
<BOS> While Annah didn’t rip you off, you guess that she just didn’t want to stick around. You figure that she had to get back to the university to get prepare things on her end. Or at least you thought she did until she comes walking back in the room. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shi…” is all he utters before you blast him in the chest. <EOS>
<BOS> You explain you want to clean this place up since she’s right to be worried about the place getting raided by the militia. You also tell her that she doesn’t need to prop Hank up either since she could easily just run the inn herself seeing as she’s practically doing that now. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh? You been fucking engineers too?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “I was expecting you here earlier, it’s not like you to leave things at the last moment.” Tanya remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I KNEW you were fucking stalking me! Get out! Get the fuck out of my room!” Annah suddenly shouts and hits you in the head with a shoe. You have no idea where she was hiding, you thought you were pretty observant and careful. <EOS>
<BOS> Well that would be one option you were pondering. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why didn’t you just let this go? (sob) There was no more danger to you any more and I certainly wasn’t going to conspire against you again. I felt sick the first time I did it. Obviously I STILL feel sick about it. I felt this way ever since I realized how deep I was getting. I was just so…I don’t know…. (sniffle) I would always think about that time we got to go to the baroness’ party. I remember mentally believing myself to be a princess and you a prince. How I wished it were you and me that night instead of you and some random whore. I really think things could have been different between us. We could have been more than friends. Even now, I wish we could just forget everything and just live in this house together as husband and wife. I don’t understand, I did everything for you. Why couldn’t you just…love me? (Sob)” <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, but I can I ask for ONE fucking request?" <EOS>
<BOS> “You know, it would have been easy to kill you months ago, but I think my time here in hiding has provided me with all the necessary information to give to the Syndicate to best effectively attack your organization. Well that and it was nice to see the shocked look on your face when you saw me again. Didn’t have to be this way, but you can take solace in the fact that your son will not be harmed. His destiny with Fel is greater than what fate will befall the rest of this island.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Well maybe not town in the traditional sense, but a place where we can do our business AND live without even worrying about the Klyton militia raiding the place because we would be so damn entrenched that they wouldn't be able to do shit even if they wanted to. We wouldn't just be the criminal organization that skulks around in the Klyton sewers, we would be a whole separate community...bah maybe I'm not explaining it well, but I envision it in my head!" You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You wince in pain as you attempt to shift position on the bed. Tanya just looks at you with a stare that feels very oppressive. <EOS>
<BOS> A few months pass and you’re making a fair amount on this venture. You weren’t sure about it at first, but Warts had a good idea. <EOS>
<BOS> “Now that’s just not true! We didn’t even spend your cut of the loot! You can even check your room! Nothing’s been touched!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Thanks baby!” Annah beams and kisses you. <EOS>
<BOS> Having no other choice, you attempt to play it dumb and make gestures that you don’t understand them. It isn’t really a plan; so much as it’s the lack of one since you really can’t understand them. Though eventually when they get exasperated enough, you understand them all too well. <EOS>
<BOS> “They must understand our position. The storm of the empire must be weathered before any counter-attack can be mustered. They must endure.” <EOS>
<BOS> The man’s jaw clenches in determination as he attacks again. This time, you use your mobility to avoid the attack and side-step away. If anything’s clear from his initial attack, you can’t win a head-to-head battle, so you change your strategy in order to draw the tank of a man into your fight. His battle axe swings towards your head, but you’re already just out of range. Immediately, you test his defenses, lunging forward and picking a high to low series of strikes. One of the strikes pierces his defense staggering him down to a knee. In his vulnerable state, you kick the shield from his grasp, from using it as a crutch to remain standing. Imitating Seth’s sweeping motion, you spin allowing your sword to gain momentum from your body. The blade cuts through the back of the man’s exposed neck, collapsing him face-first into the dirt. <EOS>
<BOS> Time to end this now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, as much fun as that was, I’m not sucking your dick all night. You’re putting that thing to better use.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, I believe it." You say closing the chest. <EOS>
<BOS> “I thought that’s what she had you for. Sneaking about snatching dissidents and potential threats off the streets.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, I just have some important matters to attend to so I’ll be happy to speak with you when I have more time. Nice meeting you though.” <EOS>
<BOS> A couple days pass and you have a burning sensation the next time you piss. <EOS>
<BOS> "Nah, they'd never expect the same place twice! Besides, it's called the Clean Mug Tavern now. It's run by two siblings, one of them even comes here to bet on the races and fights sometimes. The place is barely scraping by, so I think they would be receptive to selling it to us for cheap." <EOS>
<BOS> The carriage ride starts off uneventful and you even feel comfortable enough to get some sleep since you don’t particularly want to watch the couple slop all over one another. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the hell am I thinking? I need to go back! I can’t fucking stay here…can I?” you say to yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> You almost feel like standing up and shouting Klyton has been infiltrated by demon spawn at this point. However, you’ve got bigger concerns. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I know, the bad people made a lot of loud noise. Shhhh, it’s okay. It’s over now. Well actually let’s make sure.” <EOS>
<BOS> You continue to stay silent. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, he said he thinks what you did with the temple is a lot more fun than his other temples because of all those people you put in cages.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah there you are, we have much to discuss. My name is Rook.” He says. <EOS>
<BOS> “(sob) I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Sorry about your Academy," you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sigh) Well while I tried my best to never lead you on, you would be correct in thinking that I did have some affection for you as well. I mean how could I not? We were practically like an old married couple at times.” <EOS>
<BOS> You go off with Randi back to her room where you have…an interesting time. <EOS>
<BOS> "No," she pokes you on the forehead. "Even if you are old and creaky now. We may no longer be lovers about to start a family, but we can still be companions on a great adventure." <EOS>
<BOS> “Ha fucking ha. There. Got it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “But there are TWO beds and I’m not going to try anything!” <EOS>
<BOS> And that’s about the best you do with Peter. The rest of the discussion is mainly him going on about what he intends to change and similar things. He surprisingly doesn’t ask you much about Ludmilla even though you mention that you met her. <EOS>
<BOS> Doesn’t help though, you’re still feeling like the unnatural cold is following you. You get the very real feeling that SOMETHING is following you, but you don’t dare look behind you, all you want to do is get out of the museum and HOPE that whatever this is doesn’t follow you outside. <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t believe you just gave that as advice, but if that’s what it’s going to take to make sure you exist, then so be it. <EOS>
<BOS> “No! No we really couldn’t have Madeline. Your father made it quite clear that if he didn’t kill me, your mother sure as hell would have if I didn’t leave. I think it’s pretty obvious what the result would have been. I mean look at you, you’ve obviously embraced your demonic heritage within only two years and I’m NO fucking match for you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ey! Dat’s my shit!” Warts shouts and immediately begins to follow you. <EOS>
<BOS> After a brief moment of silence, Garrick speaks again. <EOS>
<BOS> “What for? He’s happy with her and she’s good with him when we’re not around. Breaking them up right now isn’t exactly going to do anyone any favors. So what if he fucks her later?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Well thanks for your permission." Your sister says with a mixture of amusement and disbelief. <EOS>
<BOS> You hear nothing for a moment followed by a loud sigh. This has to be killing Shade, but better his pride dies tonight than the meager remains of his temple. <EOS>
<BOS> “At least you still have your nose.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Didn’t you just say that’s the risks of the trade?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh something bad is gonna happen alright sister fucker!” He says and then brandishes a knife partially covered in blood and with a few feathers stuck to it. <EOS>
<BOS> "It's almost complete. Rob's finishing up the last rooms which are a lot bigger. One of them is going to be the fighting arena." <EOS>
<BOS> You pat her hand, but she pulls away, only to put her hand in a pocket and come up with a heavy purse. <EOS>
<BOS> “Mmmm, I won’t tell her if you don’t.” the woman says and begins going down on you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay fine I’ll do the fucking deed. Figured I might have to anyway. Hell I’ll even make it painless. I’ll just give him something lethal and tell him it’ll make him feel better. Boom. Mission accomplished. Then you can just continue running the place with free reign. Does that make it easier for you?” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because that name was taken by one of the brothels presumably. Look, I’m leaving you to it, I gotta go get ready.” <EOS>
<BOS> You push past him, and slide your sword into Mira’s chest. A soft laugh, more of a slow chuckle, escapes through the thin gap between your lips. Richard drops to a knee to catch the falling woman’s body. Seth whirls around to see the commotion. <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve already got enough daggers; you don’t really need to waste time getting some slightly fancier ones while there are obviously more valuable objects that you can pilfer. <EOS>
<BOS> “You and me both,” you say, shaking his hand. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah then tells you that when you’re done robbing the place; meet her back at the Laughing Devil and you can go from there. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright, you take some people and go find all those sea dogs and tell them I want to see them as soon as possible, I’ll take it from here with the mayor here.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You…you look very familiar. Almost like someone I once did business with…tell me someone in your family ever own an inn here?” Mr. Reynolds asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You start to laugh. <EOS>
<BOS> “I guess Vera wasn’t too successful in convincin’ other pirates to not join her ex-boyfriend.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Who…” you start to say again before the man descends on top of your body and punches you in the face with his free hand. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good, now go back and tell the rest of your gang about the change in leadership. Also assure them that they all stand to make more coin and who knows maybe you lot will actually scrape enough to buy a ship one day. In the meantime Marco, I’m going to be counting on you to make this transition smooth. I don’t want to have to straighten out the rest of your gang the way I had to with you, I don’t have the fucking time. Understand?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I just messed up is all,” you answer, rubbing your cheek. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” Seth asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Staying here has always been something you thought might be inevitable anyway so would it really matter? <EOS>
<BOS> "For my last tale before lunch," she says, "I will tell you the story of Rag-tag Jane." The storyteller glances down at a paper in her hands, and begins to tell of Rag-Tag Jane's adventures in the land below her bed. It's again cute and charming, but the older children look a little bored. You glance at the paper and see she has written shorthand notes there. Not full stories, of course, since those would vanish. But it looks like she comes up with her tales and the basic structure before she gives them, with no input from the crowd. It's no wonder she is having difficulty finding a rapport with the children. <EOS>
<BOS> Regardless, you probably would have made a move on her if it wasn’t for your condition. <EOS>
<BOS> “So you think we should just kill them?” <EOS>
<BOS> The fight isn’t stopped, because it’s obvious people either want to see a change in leadership or Tom prove that he’s still got what it takes to lead the Talons. <EOS>
<BOS> You manage to creep up on the first bandit and grab him. You aren’t exactly accustomed to do this though, so your technique isn’t perfect. You struggle a bit before managing to messily slit his throat. <EOS>
<BOS> Before you can go into some of your other ideas, Zalmora stops you with some of her own. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well your call I guess, at least I don’t have deal with them. Dealing with Warts was enough for me. Though I’m not convinced a bunch of unruly hobs are going to be the end all of extra protection.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s true, my prince. Your father, King Osborne is using dark magic to preserve his life, the lives of refugees sacrificed to lengthen his lifetime. Funny, and you were ready to put me to the sword for the exact same thing.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What about me? I’m still here. You think something bad is going to happen to me?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ll take the job.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um…I dunno…no. I’m having a bit of weird night and I’ve got a lot on my mind right now that I’m trying to forget.” you say taking another drink. <EOS>
<BOS> If anything the crime is less than one might think mainly because most are pirates and pillaging other places rather than here. You are surprisingly finding the place a bit easy on the pick pocket and theft front, of course a lot of folks are either half drunk or plain drunk most of the time. Also most folks don't seem to own that many personal belongings. You guess with most making their living at sea, they keep essentials on their ships, spend it all on booze and whores or otherwise live a very basic life, so despite you finding the town a bit easy pickings, you aren't getting rich doing it. Shops however are very well protected by the Headsmen since you guess Governor Tolen has a slice of all the businesses here. <EOS>
<BOS> Well you certainly weren’t expecting this. <EOS>
<BOS> “K…well Jochim’s blessin’ on ya if yer leaving then. You always were one of da (hic!) good ones.” <EOS>
<BOS> Fortunately, he either outright missed (or underestimated) you. You have it in you young one, to defeat Mad Merodatch and save your friends and family before it is too late.” <EOS>
<BOS> "No! I fucked him when he was strapping miner! Sheesh Zal!" <EOS>
<BOS> “Um…well…I don’t know ALL of the layout…you see there was some debate about even letting me in, so they still don’t trust me completely and as such they haven’t allowed me full access.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Driver! Slow down! The ride is too bumpy and I can’t focus on my reading!” Elana shouts while banging inside the carriage. <EOS>
<BOS> “You little bastard! You see that? He tried to kill me too! Someone get the town watch! Someone go get Klint’s family too, they need to know what this murderer did to their boy!” Wilfred shouts as he clutches his bleeding arm. <EOS>
<BOS> “And after that you’ll be cured? You won’t be cursed anymore?” <EOS>
<BOS> “WHAT?!” Annah exclaims completely fucking up your excuse. <EOS>
<BOS> The next night, with all your gear, you head to the nearest sewer entrance and descend down. You still remember the way to the Thieves Guild so it doesn’t take long. <EOS>
<BOS> “Really only know two and out of those two, only one is a proper assassin and I don’t know if it’s even possible with him.” Tom says. <EOS>
<BOS> "It is a magnificent view, indeed." You can't even imagine how it was built. In addition to the dozen spires, there are seven towers - one for bells - and you can catch the dazzling glint of stained glass windows even from farspans away. Contrary to how you've always imagined it, as a sort of dark tower, the main stone is a bleached and blinding white. <EOS>
<BOS> And then a third and FOURTH time and you’re still not sated. <EOS>
<BOS> "I told her to stop spreading that fucking rumor! That's it, if she does show up again, she's out on her ass. If she gives me shit about that, she'll join her mother! I'm not having her telling delusional lies about me anymore!" <EOS>
<BOS> “So…is this all what I should propose to Tom?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hold on! Easy there girl!” you say backing up a bit on the bed. <EOS>
<BOS> "Vaughn's actually always been a bit of a romantic. He's never been very lucky in that regard so he gets a bit weepy when he thinks he sees it in others at times." <EOS>
<BOS> “Run rabbit! Run!” Mr. Scars laughs. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately for you, you’re so intriguing that when several military looking men come running in your direction they immediately begin shouting at you in a language that you still can’t understand. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I’m glad you gave this information to me Warts. The Baroness will definitely want to know about the elven camp that’s been fucking up the logging operations in the area.” You respond <EOS>
<BOS> “I guess so…sheesh…well I guess it’s just as well. Not like they’re going to ever see me again.” <EOS>
<BOS> Vera goes into the explanation that from the information she’s gathered from Zamed, Peter is most likely going to win. While he doesn’t have the Delantium army at his command, he does have several orc mercenary companies along with a few wizards that he’s managed to make friends with from the Delantium magic university. <EOS>
<BOS> “I think I’d like Francine tonight.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Go for your sword and it gets shoved up your ass traitor!” Tanaya says. <EOS>
<BOS> “NO! WAIT! SCALES! I have something for you! Don’t kill her!” you shout and take off your pack in haste while still trying to eye on Zal who looks like she’s trying to remain as calm as she can under the circumstances. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t know, but what you do know is you need to get the hell out of here. <EOS>
<BOS> “Apologies sir, but my master is not taking any more business today, he needs to rest like everyone else.” <EOS>
<BOS> You sit up and using the base of the tree you stand yourself up. You’re in a lot of pain right now, and it’s at this moment that you realize you can’t understand what any of these gawkers are saying to each other or you. Some of the words sound similar to ones you know, but it’s almost like they’re all speaking a different language. <EOS>
<BOS> Annie is silent again for a moment and still frowning. Her eyes look down briefly, which implies she might be thinking about going for whatever weapon she has stashed under there. You still aren't worried, because even if she doesn't see the wisdom of the deal, you're confident that you'll be quick enough to reach over the bar and stab her first. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, whatever. So we’re here. What the fuck did you want to talk about?” Marco says. <EOS>
<BOS> As far as your involvement, you’re going to take a lesson from the last time you led one of these attacks. Meaning you’re not going to put yourself on the front lines and going to stay at a camp a mile away from Jicol’s gates. <EOS>
<BOS> Prince Ragar ponders a moment. “There’s no telling how many more my father would continue to kill with an extended lifetime. It could be infinite. Their one-time sacrifice will not be in vain. I will be a better king than my father. Do it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Stupid fucker, you brought all this on yourself. Jake says and then with a quick twisting motion he snaps your neck like a twig. <EOS>
<BOS> This vision then blinks away and you fall to the ground twitching a bit as your brain begins shutting down along with the rest of your body due to the bolt buried in your skull. <EOS>
<BOS> “You all right?” she asks while holding Checkers who curls up as close as she can to Annah when she sees you. <EOS>
<BOS> "Welcome to Havor," Kinsam steeples his hands and nods. You return the gesture. <EOS>
<BOS> “Who the fuck are you to call me a liar!? You weren’t there, that’s what happened!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “Now you want me to go with you to the brothel? Will it help if I’m there?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> In these close quarters its difficult to avoid him, but you’re still a lot more agile than him. You honestly don’t intend on fighting him, your goal is to get around him and out the door so you can get outside. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, that was my intention. I think it might need more expansion, and of course we’re going to make it look better than it currently does, but it’s well on its way!” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s nothing. Go inside. (Sniffle) I’m not sure which gods you two worship, but there is a church of Joachim the Pure that’s open all the time. You can probably get married there right now. It’s just two rights and a left from where you go past the city gates. You can also find a cheap inn in the same area. You should have enough.” The guard says still trying to keep it together. <EOS>
<BOS> Madeline. <EOS>
<BOS> Later when you approach Zal and Vaughn with this idea, they're caught off guard by this plan, but don't seem put off by it. Well Vaughn doesn't at least. Zal of course has her usual concerns. <EOS>
<BOS> To your surprise, Rook isn’t quite dead yet! <EOS>
<BOS> You find a bench and wait. Soon, you start to get a little sleepy again despite your attempts at still trying to stay awake. You also start to wonder if it wouldn’t be better to just stay in Hessla when you get there. <EOS>
<BOS> “Pretty sure we all want that.” <EOS>
<BOS> You look a bit wary at Flynt and his fellows after that question. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t think she…” <EOS>
<BOS> (Well at least taking matters into your own hand is always safe) <EOS>
<BOS> When confronted by this, Warts explains that the hobs just work better together since they all grew up in the same tribe. He also says there’s less potential for infighting during slow periods. He then points to how much success they’ve had with this arrangement. <EOS>
<BOS> "Seems like more hassle. You'd still have to buy it from the city which could present some problems. Assuming they didn't ask many questions, you'd still have to fix the place up before we could start using it proper. Wouldn't we need to get an alcohol supplier and hire people as well?" Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I suppose you’ve given me a lot to think about as far as business is concerned.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> "Come back to me my love." The voice says in more melodic tone. <EOS>
<BOS> Just as you’re thinking you’re going to be soon singing soprano, something unexpected happens. Instead of crushing your manhood, she instead lifts you up over her head, not that this isn’t still painful of course. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, where are you going boss?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, okay, I’m ready, let’s get in the carriage.” <EOS>
<BOS> Gloom blasts the temple’s doors off their hinges with a dark magic bolt of some sort. Then he takes the lead, you tell your hobgoblins to stand guard outside and kill anyone who tries to escape. They faithfully obey and you enter with the crowd of Felians that are entering the temple, staying close to the back of course. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure! We used to sell more than a few back in the old days and they’re really low upkeep and easy to nab as well.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, the Barnacle down the street is pretty cheap. In fact you can just go into their public flop room for free. Wouldn’t really advise that though unless you’re a light sleeper or completely destitute. The Headsmen might keep relative order around here, but they can’t stop every potential crime and you’re likely to get robbed there. It’s just common sense you know?” <EOS>
<BOS> Jake’s been on your case since day one. You just know you’re going to have to deal with him someday. Maybe today is that day. <EOS>
<BOS> Lorthander raises his staff into the air and shouts incoherent words. Magic pulses into the air in a ripple, as if a stone dropped into a body of water. The ripples extend from the staff and pulse through the archers. The heavy rain of arrows stop for a moment, and then you hear cries from the keep walls. You see some of the archers lifelessly fall from the top, leaving behind red stains and protruding bone on the ground below. The top of the keep becomes a chaotic mess of infighting. Imperial soldiers fire on their own and take up arms against one another, similarly to your first steps inside the crumbling ruins Lorthander resided in. <EOS>
<BOS> “Being a friendly harbor to pirates and the like made you fairly safe from them. I dare say it was a bigger deterrent than your navy in some respects. Changing what wasn’t broken was foolish.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sorry, but times are hard right now, that’s the best I can offer!” Saldinius replies making a shrugging motion. <EOS>
<BOS> “No…wait, how is Vaughn like?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Certainly," the eagle offered, spreading his wings. But though he grasped, the clouds could not be held - and his piece, too, dropped to the waiting snake. <EOS>
<BOS> “No.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh....well hey how about this deal then? You’ve never been to Klyton, so how about in exchange for my freedom I give you some basic information on some of the neighborhoods and potential places you could easily go burgle. I mean obviously I’m rubbish at it, but if you’re as good as you say you are, they should be easy for you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh we’re going to see about that. Come on.” <EOS>
<BOS> You snicker a bit at the thought of Warts having a couple kids, but you suppose he seems happy with them. You’re just glad you aren’t saddled with any; you’ve got enough complications in your life. <EOS>
<BOS> Marco just looks at you and then at his buddies with a blank expression. <EOS>
<BOS> Gertrude closes her eyes, and grits her teeth, bracing for her death as you put two in her head. <EOS>
<BOS> As much as you’re trying to put the past aside and focus on your new relationship with Vera which is seemingly going well, it’s not entirely simple. <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh? What you mean?” Warts replies. <EOS>
<BOS> "Still awake," you admit from your spot on the floor. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t turn around. Into that alley now. You try anything, and you’ll have a bolt through the back. Move.” A voice whispers as you feel a crossbow shoved into your back. <EOS>
<BOS> The driver at this point grabs your arm. <EOS>
<BOS> “No! I know what he did, but you’re not killing him! Despite everything, the man DID help me at one time and I’m not going to just forget that. Just leave us.” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya starts to laugh. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are…Are you fucking kidding me?! YOU were the one that stabbed him repeatedly in the back! I actually stopped YOU from killing Klint!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “If you haven’t noticed, my organization is fighting for its survival and we don’t have time to sit on our hands and wait for the enemy to overwhelm us!” <EOS>
<BOS> Several of the people look at each other in silence wondering if anyone is going to protest, but nobody does. <EOS>
<BOS> You suddenly feel a blow to the back of your head and you go unconscious. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, Klyton is the only place you really have any basic knowledge about thanks to your parents both being originally from there. Your father never really spoke too much about it, just saying that the only thing worthwhile that he got there was your mother and he was glad when they finally moved to Teckleville to be closer to your grandmother at the time. <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera, while I appreciate the offer, I’m still not sure if that’s a good idea.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Just stories of them being lizard people that live in the swamps and fight with elves all the time.” <EOS>
<BOS> The other thing is, Tanya has changed so much now that she probably isn’t recognizable anymore, not that she really made her face visible in the first place, but she looks more like a traditional demon now rather than the half breed she actually is. You think you can spin a lie… <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s actually not the part I’m talking about. In fact if it were JUST that, I’d be willing to get naked with you while my highly trained assistants performed the incantations for the ritual right now. However, what the Elder neglected to mention is the fact that this ritual would result in the poor girl’s death.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah! Typical male ego. You wish. But I’ll tell you who IS jealous, Camid.” Zalmora retorts. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I admit, I never really saw myself as a mother, but I mean…I dunno…we already got roots in place, we might well have a family.” <EOS>
<BOS> Probably for the best that she’s still lingering in your mind, because if you really thought about just how deep of shit you probably are as far as powerful enemies you’ve made, you’d probably be a lot more depressed. <EOS>
<BOS> "What's so special about it?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sometimes I wonder if maybe our lives got more complicated after we left Holgard.” <EOS>
<BOS> “This way, this way,” he continues, ushering you in. “Here, take this,” he adds, handing you an oil lantern. “You’ll need it to see in the dark.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shut up, just shut up! I should have known better! Should have known you weren’t different! Didn’t think you’d be worse though!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Stupid bitch? You’re the ones in a dumb ass gang probably giving half of your shit to your boss. I’d say you’re the stupid bitches here.” Annah replies. <EOS>
<BOS> “Do I even need to ask how you even tracked me in all this chaos?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “So, this is Thieves Guild territory now? I always thought this place was supposed to be neutral.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You continue to lie on the bed mostly motionless just thinking about how she’s really gone now and allow yourself to weep a bit. Eventually enough time passes that you get ahold of yourself and you feel a little rested enough to sit up. <EOS>
<BOS> This greenskin obviously has no concept of haggling. It really isn’t like you don’t have the coin, it’s more like you don’t want to give so much to the likes of him after being fortunate enough to acquire it in the first place. <EOS>
<BOS> Rook at this point stands up. <EOS>
<BOS> After a few more words, Rook escorts you out of the room and you soon learn you’re at a bigger Ebony Claw headquarters that leads up into a warehouse and then eventually between the poor area of Holgard and the merchant district. <EOS>
<BOS> You continue to follow without another word, until he gets to a secluded spot with a sewer covering. <EOS>
<BOS> “Nature’s Revenge.” <EOS>
<BOS> Especially due to what happens next. <EOS>
<BOS> When you ask if there is any other alternative, Heather says, you all could attack Peter directly since he’s probably still aboard his ship. The problem with that is, there is still a good-sized fleet near the Holgard docks. Heather says casting magic at the ships might bring a few of them down, but not before the rest of them start firing cannonballs back, and who knows if you’re going to get Peter or not. <EOS>
<BOS> “In that box you will find the noses of your agents you sent to Delantium. While the ECS recognizes that you are obviously a hard to kill man with powerful enough allies to cause more trouble than it’s worth to keep fucking with you, they will NOT tolerate you spying on their territory. Do it again, and it won’t matter who your friends in high places are. Consider this a respectful warning.” Percy says shoving the box a little closer to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Put your hands around my throat.” She suddenly says. <EOS>
<BOS> It closes behind you, leaving you alone in the large room, apparently with only a minute before angry, armed rioters rush through the doors. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, this is a very elaborate story you’re telling. My question is this though. How do you know all this shit in the first place? I mean I only have your word on this. I can’t obviously interrogate Mr. Dream or Weaver about this, because you fucking killed them. Lloyd here is obviously hysterical and going to plead his innocence. I’m NOT even saying what you’re saying is a lie because we ARE all a bunch of fucking criminals when it comes down to it, but I’m gonna need a little more convincing.” Rook says. <EOS>
<BOS> For all you know you’re the founder of the Ebony Claw Syndicate. <EOS>
<BOS> "Ah," you say, "But that is our story! Never underestimate the smallest of creatures." <EOS>
<BOS> Gloom blasts the temple’s doors off their hinges with a dark magic bolt of some sort. Then he takes the lead, you tell your hobgoblins to rush forward for the kill as soon as the orb is dropped. They faithfully obey and you all enter with the crowd of Felians that are entering the temple. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey Warts, I don’t have the five gold coins, but I do have these.” You say and hold out Graham’s rings to Warts. <EOS>
<BOS> Shaking her head, she steps forward for another series of attacks. This time you’re ready for her. Covering your head and torso, you wait for her offense to begin. As she lets loose another combination, you drive your weight into her. One of your arms underhooks hers, and the other wraps around the far side of her neck. Shifting your hips below Kassi’s for leverage, you complete the “head ‘n arm” throw and land on top of her. Before she can recover, you toss the underhooked arm aside and press your head into the base of her arm, pinning it against the side of her neck. Connecting both hands together, you begin to squeeze. Your arm around Kassi’s neck and her own arm pressed against the other side cuts off her air flow. <EOS>
<BOS> Well that’s a bit of interesting information about the city, though a bit concerning. You wonder if you’re going to find yourself in the middle of a citywide revolt when you get to Holgard. <EOS>
<BOS> “By the time he’s a teenager, Layla’s still not going to be an old hag. I mean she’s barely an adult herself right now. So I imagine he’ll still physically attracted to her, to say nothing of the emotional attachment he’ll have.” <EOS>
<BOS> Seth pulls a stray hair from his armored robe. “Of course, my king. The Emperor’s troops have gotten lazy in the past few years. I’m sure they’re just waiting us out until the Empire can free up more troops for a grand-scale siege. Right now, they’re content keeping us walled in. I’d be surprised if they’re even running drills down there.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit…yeah…(pant) the fuck you come from?” you gasp. <EOS>
<BOS> When the night of the gathering comes, you don’t make an appearance right away. Eventually Warts comes to get you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you sure he resisted?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I figured it shouldn’t be a wasted trip. So what have you been up to?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Minutes," Frogill warns again. "They are even now at the gate! The Head Mage must leave." <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I just don’t think it’s a good idea, but maybe if you ever visit them again, could you tell them that I’m doing okay?” <EOS>
<BOS> You spend the next few days not doing much of anything other than buying some things you need and spending a little extra on better quality food than you normally do. <EOS>
<BOS> Your story finished, you glance over the crowd. Some clap politely, a few broadly smile. Most look unsure - as if waiting for the reaction of the Empress. <EOS>
<BOS> “True. Enter it then. Unless you’re scared.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Uh, how long have you had those?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Claire then takes you to the magic school area of the campus and that’s where you part ways with her. She tells you she’ll be back at the inn. <EOS>
<BOS> Well this explains where Yinen has been. Poor bastard’s probably been tortured for quite awhile. You still don’t know what happened with Tanya either. Was a spell cast on her? She is half succubus, was the “presence of Neroth” forcing her to act more within her nature? <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t have many problems on the way there, but you do come across a few unexpected faces. It’s some of the Nocturnal League. They look like they’ve already been in a few scrapes. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I don’t deny, your new status is a bit intimidating on a certain level. The slave trade part is especially a bit of grim business, but you’re my brother and no matter what, I’ll be by your side.” Your sister says touching your hand. <EOS>
<BOS> "Sort of bittersweet." Ronin yawns, "but interesting." He is holding the tin soldier in his hand - he must have taken it from the shelf during your story. He reaches for something in his mattress and pulls out a box, fishing through it. "I liked it. I'll give you a tip." He hands you about twenty silver coins. "It's not that surprising," he laughs lightly, "my dad sends me a handful of coins every month. I just haven't got to spend them." <EOS>
<BOS> “Good, nice thinking Vera.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, your mind starts racing about what you can do in your current situation. First thing you think about is escape. The cart is going slow enough that you could probably easily jump out and just run. The problem with that plan is there are multiple mounted guards to the front and back of you. They would easily run you down and most likely kill you for attempting to escape. <EOS>
<BOS> “(sniffle) You’re…you’re not?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I can do that for you,” a girl’s voice meekly speaks from the back of the tent. <EOS>
<BOS> You attempt to leave, but the captain stands in your way. It’s obvious now that there were other plans in play here. <EOS>
<BOS> She has sharp teeth that now accompany her deadly seductress face and sharp talons far superior to any manmade weapon she might’ve used at one time. <EOS>
<BOS> Flailing and crying out, he falls to the floor mobbed by several qweepas who are eager to finish him off. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, I’m trying to work on this fucking lock and I’m having a hard enough time doing this in near darkness without you trying analyze my home life.” <EOS>
<BOS> The last thing you see are inhuman jaws enclosing on your face followed by a sickening crunch sound. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t reply. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah we’re good…actually here’s something for your rescue effort. It would be more, but well as you can see, a bit down on fortune at the moment.” Tom says handing you a few gold coins from a pouch. <EOS>
<BOS> “What are you atoning for?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Scales! Please, all we wanted to do is return this egg to you. Edmond is dead. We weren’t following his orders or anything like that. We were going to ask for help, but it’s obvious that you want to be alone. I will go back and never bother you again. You have my word.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Okay Vaughn, we're going to try your guy, so go tell him what's going on, sober him up, clean him up and have him come see me about further details. I also want you to stress that while he doesn't really have a choice in this matter, he'll be making more money and won't have to be getting punched in the face for living." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh you know, it’s the same old thing. Some good days, some bad, but can’t complain. The Nocturnal League isn’t the same without you though.” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> You immediately come out of your office and start running around telling your employees (Both legal and criminal) what to do. There predictably is a lot of yelling, grumbling and rushing back and forth. <EOS>
<BOS> - One of the local libraries is having a 'family day' with storytelling. No doubt they already have a storyteller, but perhaps they wouldn't say no to another one filling in on breaks, and it would be likely they'd let you perform another day. It's doubtful kids or their parents would pay a lot at a library, but you reasonably expect the library will suit your needs well enough. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah. And I would have been willing to just go along with it, not knowing shit. By Dorna was I a fucking fool back then. Anyway, I hope this news isn’t too disappointing for you.” <EOS>
<BOS> The mercenaries both glance at each other and don’t look too enticed by your offer, but fortunately they aren’t entirely calling the shots. <EOS>
<BOS> Several other townsfolk go running off shouting about your deeds, and a few others look as if they’re going to take their chances apprehending you themselves and while Wilfred is a fat out of shape barkeep, you don’t know if you’d do as well against the blacksmith who is now approaching you with a hammer in hand. <EOS>
<BOS> “But doesn’t that sort of decrease the quality?” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, this is my first time within its borders actually.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve had to deal with many struggles during your life and not all of them of the mundane criminal variety. If that were the case, your life would have probably been a lot simpler. <EOS>
<BOS> “Mm, didn’t see it, I was just concerned about not getting caught in the cross fire of a stray magic missile or possible a Felian blade after realizing they had been had.” <EOS>
<BOS> But Rom was persistent. He made a horse massage table to relax them, hummed to them as he groomed them, and even made horseshoes fitting for dance and gave them lessons. But while some of his inventions and plans made them happy for a time, and others frustrated, nothing had the permanent effect he wanted in raising their spirits. <EOS>
<BOS> “I guess. So why’d you stay?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Um…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. Shit, guess I should come up with a name. Fuck. Can’t think of one right now.” <EOS>
<BOS> Your new headquarters is also much better than the one you had in the sewers <EOS>
<BOS> “What I mean is, it sounds like she just wants you to not yell at her so much when she wants to try something new. You telling her that she sucks at the flute might be the truth, but you could approach it a different way and not just tell her to give it up. You need to be more…sensitive.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s not the size of the weapon, it’s how you use it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Stop. Stop. Stop. Are you seriously doing what I think you’re trying to do?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course not, but what about Jenny?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Is that so? Well if you don’t know how to properly contact him, maybe YOU shouldn’t be looking for him, let alone coming in here uninvited.” <EOS>
<BOS> You desperately try to fight your way out, expending all your shots and destroying a good portion of one of the statues, but more of them come into the room and block your escape. <EOS>
<BOS> Zal then turns to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, so were you thinking about starting a League chapter in the Delantium Kingdom? <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s safer than you think, you just prop yourself up against the trunk and a large enough branch. It’ll actually be safer than sleeping on the ground. Up in a tree we can at least…” <EOS>
<BOS> The Delantium Kingdom to the east isn’t really high on your choice list. For one thing, you’d have to backtrack around Teckleville to go in that direction. From what you’ve overheard, the kingdom has been slowly trying to expand again which sounds a lot like more soldier types running around and that’s the last thing you need. Still, the kingdom is a big place and they can’t possibly be everywhere. Sivak is the closest major city there. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, don’t get mad, but I thought I saw the signs that your son had the shadow gift a few times before.” Gertrude says. <EOS>
<BOS> You walk through the relatively smooth tunnels of the new Crimson Talon headquarters. Lanterns light your way as you look around at how far it's all come. The rooms that were created still need some more detailed work since they're very basic, but for a guy who started out not being sure if he could do any of this, he's done a good job so far. You guess Vaughn was right, once Rob got going he gained confidence. (Either that or Vaughn was giving a lot of inspirational blow jobs, but you'd rather not dwell on that) <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, you aren’t even sure if the Felians will be receptive to an alliance or what it might even entail. You have to try though because you can’t afford to just sit by and do nothing anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, what sort of ritual?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, well you aren’t cursed.” <EOS>
<BOS> You sister exhales deeply and sits next to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “You know when I brought you in, I thought you’d be an asset to us. Sure you weren’t exactly what I normally look for, but your actions against the Ebony Claw couldn’t be ignored. Your ongoing work to prove yourself worthy of becoming one of the inner circle couldn’t be ignored. Granted, I was still a little hesitant at the time since I was starting to have some doubts since so many thought you should continue to prove yourself, but Tanya’s words in your favor…well those couldn’t be ignored either.” <EOS>
<BOS> “The dumb asses getting addicted to Purple Wish have a choice. Look, as I said, I’m not pissed or anything like that, but if I was to come to Jicol, I’d have some strong feeling about you continuing your slave trade business. In any case I’m still not convinced that I should just run away. Speaking with Peter Varsakken would at least be a better idea, though I’m not exactly sure how I’d go about setting up a meeting with him…wait a minute, that pirate of yours Zamed. He wouldn’t happen to be meeting him anytime soon would he?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, you might talk casually with your fellow slaves.” <EOS>
<BOS> You must have lost your mind, because you can’t believe you’re actually considering this. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I’m rebuilding an organization for us and you’re all invited to join and get richer than you are.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What’s it look like? I’m getting ready to make love to you. In fact why are you still dressed? I would have thought you’d be the first one to have your pants off by now.” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> Randi now looks offended. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually Zal solves her own struggle with climbing back up to the walkway and makes her way to your location. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, well see that you continue with that line of thinking. In any case, you can go tell my wife that I want to talk with her and that you’ll do as a sitter for Kol when needed. At least until further notice.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well I’ve never been one to play it too safe, so if this is it for me, there are worse ways. Might as well at least be because you fucked me. Now let’s do this already.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Are you telling the story, or am I?" <EOS>
<BOS> “I hate to break this to you, but they haven’t even let me in their little clubhouse yet.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Of course I'm being fucking serious! You're young, easy on the eyes and I don't get out much. Besides, I know I'm not that fucking ugly." <EOS>
<BOS> You could be as prepared as possible and still get yourself killed in the battle or perhaps even Zal would get killed. You have to admit you'd be pretty upset if that occurred. Maybe you are in love after all. <EOS>
<BOS> “Certainly hope you’re having an easier time of it than I am sis.” You say to yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course this leave you with the question of whether you SHOULD kill Rook and Bolt now while you have the element of surprise or if you should wait for Tanya because you know it won’t be that long before she decides to attack anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> The Inquisitor, still as zealous as ever makes a rare public appearance calling for a holy crusade on the city itself and that anyone who truly believes in Joachim’s light, should follow or be cast down into darkness like the rest of the infidels. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ki--" you begin to command before resisting the voice. You feel it build within you. It wants to be released. It coaxes, wanting to let you rest and take control for awhile. And why shouldn’t you? You’ve fought hard enough up until this point. Why not allow it to finish things? <EOS>
<BOS> "What is this?" she asked her assistants, "they cheer even for some that have lost!" <EOS>
<BOS> “And we’re here to see it gets done thoroughly because this needs to be finished TODAY.” <EOS>
<BOS> The various addicts excited by the prospect of getting free drugs immediately start telling on each other. A couple of them confess what they've done since they apparently are thinking long term and want the coin rather than just the drugs. <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sigh) As long as I’ve been mayor, this young man has been a blight on this town despite his father and mother being good people. I can’t fault them for defending him because above all else he is their son. But another son was killed and that’s the main reason we’re here today. The rape accusation…well quite frankly the young girl denies that it happened and if she’s deluded enough to defend her abusive criminal boyfriend…well I just shake my head in dismay and nothing else. Given her own shady reputation, I’m actually inclined they just enjoy a sick relationship.” <EOS>
<BOS> You explain that one of the reasons you were so friendly with Heather wasn’t because you were fucking her, but because she could potentially lift the curse. It just was taking her awhile to research it. <EOS>
<BOS> And then nothing but a loud splash. <EOS>
<BOS> You leave Warts and head home to the Blackheart Inn. On your way to your room, you toss a bag of coins to the innkeeper stating that you’re going to be having a “gathering” on the weekend and you need . He doesn’t ask questions since he knows by now what sort of man you are and more importantly all the coin you’ve given him is understanding enough. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, well jokes are fine, but never about the Syndicate business. I hope you remember that.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I know. It’s been a concern of mine too. Now that the League is bigger, we’re probably attracting a lot more attention. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh I’m sure I could probably find some.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad to hear we’re making Holgard safe for whores again at least. Come on, you’ve all got a new task. We’re heading to the palace and making sure to keep these spell slingers safe along the way because they need to save their strength for what lies ahead.” <EOS>
<BOS> You continue your discussion of your plan… <EOS>
<BOS> As the Thieves’ Guild has been losing ground however, they’ve been less “free spirited” and have been actively trying to recruit any freelance thief, burglar, pick pocket they can. However, they’re more reasonable about it than the ECS since they still don’t force you to join and will let you remain independent. As opposed to the ECs who normally just beat the hell out of any freelancers as a warning once and if they get caught again, it ends much worse. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not sure why you’re yelling, considering I agree, but I’m still leery about seeing some witch. I almost feel like we should just try to handle this ourselves.” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> "I dunno, I mean she's got a mouth on her, but she's just a skinny thing and I can't see her giving us any trouble if we seriously threaten her." <EOS>
<BOS> “As nice as last night was, it’s best I don’t get used to it. The longer I stay here, the more I’ll lose myself. I can’t afford that weakness. I know to you I’ll always be that girl you fell in love with, but I assure you I am much more now and very different. I have responsibilities that you couldn’t hope to know.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Magic…wow, I have so many question and I’ve only just stepped in the door!” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, but I did spend the entire night fucking some woman who apparently robbed me after I passed out.” <EOS>
<BOS> “By the gods…I love you…” you utter and then drift off. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, I think I can manage, but what about Heather? I mean are you fine to go along with this?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Please, I didn’t even know about you until recently and that’s only because you and that lowly halfbreed foolishly went and half assed robbed a rich Neroth cultist.“ the woman says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Okay. Apologies. You got everything under control, I'm done with my caution." <EOS>
<BOS> “Hell, if it wasn’t for him payin’ for da ale, I wouldn’t even be here. So what’s dis all about?” A third says. <EOS>
<BOS> “What’s Gilo’s Gridiron?” <EOS>
<BOS> When you finally get to Hessla, its actually a little nicer looking than you thought it was going to look. You expected it to be filled with run down homes with unsavory types located on every corner. If anything, the town has locations that are fancier looking than some of the better parts of Klyton. <EOS>
<BOS> You toss away the body and shoot several more of your assailants with your pistol. <EOS>
<BOS> You start shaking your head. <EOS>
<BOS> “The problem is, your little crime war was supposed to be kept to a dull fucking roar and for the past couple months you lot have been murdering each other in the streets and scaring the shit out of the civvies! You also got gangs of thugs like these loitering around. Now I know we have an agreement that will keep most of the scum out of this city for good, but the mayor is getting very weary of this conflict and is wondering if he shouldn’t just have all parties involved executed.” The watchman captain says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I can tell. Though you actually started drinking without me giving it to you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Old bastard is lucky we didn’t kill him.” Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the fuck are you idiots doing!? You could have hurt the baby! We need him alive!” you hear Gertrude remark <EOS>
<BOS> Samuel warns him with a look and continues. “Shades are the spirits of the dead in possession of a living being. Is there a reason a shade would be interested in another being? A boy.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Somewhat…yes.” <EOS>
<BOS> At this point you’re wondering why if she thinks you’re such a bad bum to her that why is she with you at all. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well, be that as it may, this place isn’t doing all that bad since I arrived. I don’t see you starving and besides androgynous elves, you’re swimming in college pussy and getting your drugs. So I say things are going to stay as they are for now.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “At the time, I couldn’t. Tried. Couldn’t.” <EOS>
<BOS> So you do the only logical thing and let go of the sword causing the orc to pull too much on his end, lose his balance; fall off his horse and over the side of bridge. <EOS>
<BOS> You sort of wonder if maybe you should follow up on Gwen’s flirting now, but then would she even be interested any more given what she’s learned about you? You suppose the best way to find out is to just go for it. <EOS>
<BOS> Heading up the path towards the edge of the forest’s old growth, you climb up Dagger Hill and arrive at Kragan Firehand’s tower. It’s a tall stone tower with a single entry across a short drawbridge. You’ve heard that the wizard Kragan keeps all sorts of magic wards on his tower to protect it from the monsters within the old forest, and as you cross the clearing towards the drawbridge, you indeed feel a tingling sensation of unknown power. <EOS>
<BOS> The crowd quiets, whispering to each other in anticipation, as they await your traditional selection of who will give the final prompt. <EOS>
<BOS> “I…I don’t really know.” Keira remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> The servants moved to cut another honeycomb, 'For the princess,' they said, 'to squeeze honey.' She held up a hand to stop them, taking off her beekeeper's headdress. <EOS>
<BOS> “But…” <EOS>
<BOS> “End this illusion…whatever you are!” you sputter. <EOS>
<BOS> “No. I figure I at least owe you a quick death for old times sake. Not to mention you wrecking Jicol the way you did, you’ve given me even less to have to worry about since now that place doesn’t even have the strong law enforcement numbers it once did, meaning the Nocturnal League’s influence on it isn’t even gone. Besides, I doubt even Vera would be able to talk a slaver into buying you for much anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> You could run, but you’re still a bit dazed and they’re already almost on you. <EOS>
<BOS> You try to get a little closer and every inch of you is struggling to not slip into unconsciousness. You see the EC member block several of Tanya’s attacks and then manages to knock her down with some sort of glowing magic from his hand. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I certainly wish you luck if that’s what you’re going to do.” <EOS>
<BOS> If you weren’t on the verge of dying, you’d swear that Tanya’s words aren’t just about your betrayal of the Guild. She’s obviously taking this personally. Your suspicions are confirmed when you see Tanya’s eyes water a bit just before she breaks your neck. <EOS>
<BOS> “Think so? Thanks! If everyone here is as much of a soft sell as that guard, we’re going to clean up.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Your son? This man is your son?” you reply. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because they don’t truly accept you from what you told me, and besides didn’t you tell me the Spider Fang tribe survived when others didn’t because they worked together the best?” <EOS>
<BOS> What do you say son? Are you Game?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well you’re good at a lot of other things too, but you’re not volunteering for a position at a whore house.” <EOS>
<BOS> Rob just nods. <EOS>
<BOS> "No! You deadbeat fuckers still owe! I'm not absolving anyone of their debts and don't think I won't still enforce that! However, only part of it will be taken out of your pay. If and when you finish paying off your debt, you can either continue working here for your full pay or go on your way." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> In fact some of the bums in your fights are ex-miners. You wouldn't want to rely on just them though, but surely you could scour the city for other ex-miners down on their luck or working jobs they hate. They probably would work cheap. You suppose if you really needed more you could shell out the money for some outside help, but you'd rather keep the costs as low as possible. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera’s body eventually contorts into an unnatural state and she unleashes a shriek that is definitely not human sounding. She can take no more and with that, her body splits and explodes. <EOS>
<BOS> A flurry of crimson and blade flies through the air toward you. Translucent weapons appear in your hands, just in time, blocking the sudden assault. The other commanders in the great hall draw their swords, but don’t attack yet, unsure which of their two leaders to aide. <EOS>
<BOS> There isn’t much else in the room itself, though there is another door off to the side, this one isn’t locked and you open it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit.” You say attempting to cover up with a pillow and then once again telling her to get out. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah that’s fucking it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Blackheart Inn…why the hell don’t these inns ever have invitin’ names? Like I dunno, the friendly titties, or sumthin.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Go back to bed," Spryce growls from the other cot. "You can't do anything for him." <EOS>
<BOS> “Guess again. Hahahahahahaha! (hic) So can ya spare a copper?” <EOS>
<BOS> Then he saw it. The demon’s ruins. A crumbling castle, overgrown with grass. Large stone blocks scattered in the surrounding field. The front gate is simply an open arch; the actual gate has long fallen from its place. It’s inviting, welcoming in newcomers to walk into the deteriorating walls. Ekk’a spotted the fallen buck not 30 feet past the arch. Notching an arrow at the ready, Ekk’a stepped through. <EOS>
<BOS> "You are the muse of heroes," you laugh, "and you lecture me of the impossible?" <EOS>
<BOS> You leave Garrick and exit the meeting room somewhat expecting there to be a few people hanging around outside listening to the conversation, but it would appear that nobody wanted to be around for Garrick’s anger to be directed towards them as well. Not even Sneaks lingered behind. <EOS>
<BOS> Having no pride and a strong sense of self-preservation, you muster up all your remaining energy and run in the opposite direction of the orc and woman. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm sure mom wouldn't mind seeing you. Dad, well he probably wouldn't mind either seeing as you're not a criminal anymore. You aren't are you?" <EOS>
<BOS> "I guess shortly after we both left. I think he's about twenty or around that age. He's okay, a bit on the straight-laced side. Guess mom and dad finally got the well behaved child they always wanted." <EOS>
<BOS> Several cultists try to pick you up again, but you do everything you can to prevent them from doing so. Eventually you get walloped and kicked in the head enough times that you’re unable to do much of anything except struggle to stay conscious. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sounds reasonable I guess. What are they called anyway?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shut up!” one of the men says and pokes you in the chest with his spear hard enough that it superficially breaks the skin. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, I wouldn’t do that. Not when you’ve done so much for me. In fact I was sort of wondering if you’d come with me.” <EOS>
<BOS> The cave is a bit closer, and doesn't rely on hoping for complete strangers to take you in. You spur the donkey on towards it. It's slightly bigger than you first estimated, though that is little blessing. You tie the donkey under a rock ledge - he'll be protected somewhat by the hill itself - and duck into the cave. <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re having these inner reflections, you see a group of people hanging around laughing and generally having their attention focused on a little black and white curly haired dog, which is enjoying the attention. <EOS>
<BOS> “Uh, sure I suppose I can do that. I won’t overlook a chance to get a discount.” <EOS>
<BOS> You are then suddenly smashed in the back of the head by something, causing you to collapse. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course maybe that's the entire problem. You're working too hard period. It might not be the lifestyle, but more the location and job. You remember the more carefree years when you or you and a few others broke into a store and nicked a few items and coins, or picked the pockets of some rich merchant. You took just enough to live well for awhile and then you went out and did it all over again. <EOS>
<BOS> You look around and see a few stores that have been looted, some in the process of being looted, but nothing excessive. The city isn’t on fire or anything. (Just a couple of buildings) <EOS>
<BOS> The Ebony Claw Syndicate certainly sent a reminder to all onlookers that they are the not to be opposed. <EOS>
<BOS> “No.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, I’m not going to say anything. Not like there would be anything to gain. Though I guess this is why you want to go to this party so badly huh? Experience what might have been? Possibly even briefly speak with your older half sister?” <EOS>
<BOS> Vaughn and Zalmora are the only other people that know about this plan and while Vaughn is a go with the flow type guy as well, Zalmora still thinks getting rid of Jake in this manner was a bad idea. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, you can think with one head or the other, but you can’t do both. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah Baroness Varsakken is unfortunately a lot more efficient than her father was. Been a steady increase in security in the city making life harder in general. Miss the days when they wouldn’t even bother you or you could easily just bribe them.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck that, I’ve tried everything with you and nothing fucking works! You are content on just berating me day in day out! When you aren’t bitching about what I’m doing, you’re finding new stuff to nag me about! I thought maybe things would be different here between us, but I guess not. So since you can’t seem to let go, I’ll do all the work as usual…” <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose, but I still don’t see how this makes things better for the inn. I mean it’s still a drug den.” <EOS>
<BOS> Hopefully, you won’t have to though since again there’s a chance some of your people might be still in the woods somewhere. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well I want to be on the safe side. We’ll come in with your people.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> The next day, you enter the Clean Mug Tavern which can't possible be true given that you feel like you need to jump in a river just by setting foot in the place. Which is saying a lot considering you do most of your business in the fucking sewers. <EOS>
<BOS> Dr. Gossey goes on to thank you and exclaim that she’s glad you came along when you did and hopes you have a safe and productive trip. She also gives you directions of how to get out of the medical school, since you were lost in the first place. <EOS>
<BOS> “No! You stay over there! This fucking floor is weak enough without both of us in the same area.” <EOS>
<BOS> Honestly, Heather is still your best chance at getting cured, so if she’s dead then you might as well have left Holgard when this all happened. Besides, you don’t fancy your chances against multiple demons and a wizard. You figure if you’re quiet and careful enough you’ll be able to sneak up to the top of the building and just shoot the wizard opposing Heather in the back. <EOS>
<BOS> When you’re within the gates it’s dawn and you can see that the city is a lot cleaner and organized looking than Holgard. Granted since you’ve risen in status, Holgard has gotten a bit better about this, but this is definitely a city that has never undergone the same struggles Holgard ever has. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, along with all the other concerns you have. The guy trying to recruit you didn't exactly spin this in the best of light and most of the crew are apparently dead so what the hell is the captain like if he's getting everyone killed? <EOS>
<BOS> One thing you have noticed is that over the years, the Felians aren’t quite the disciplined shadowy priests they once were. Not to say they wouldn’t be formidable in a fight, but they definitely aren’t like how they were under their previous leadership. Gloom wasn’t even aware that the Syndicate was visiting. For a group that’s generally known for being masters of secrets and such, they seem a bit out of the loop nowadays. <EOS>
<BOS> You think about this a few moments. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thanks.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t worry, I can handle it myself. Besides, it’ll be a lot harder for them to focus on a single smaller target rather than a group. You should go with my students however. They probably should have someone to back them up for protection. I mean there’s not much you can do to help against a bunch of ships anyway. Speaking of crews, where is the rest of your people?” Heather asks. <EOS>
<BOS> If word gets out that you’re selling your enemies into slavery that could scare a lot of folks into joining. Getting killed is one thing, but getting turned into a slave might be enough to give some people pause. <EOS>
<BOS> “I see, and how do you know all this?” <EOS>
<BOS> “So how do I look?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Treachery, by King Osborne’s most trusted advisor no less. No, Prince Ragar did not have time for the common soldier. He swings open the double doors to the castle’s chapel and sees his target by the main altar, surrounded by dozens of lit candles, most of which are bathed in melted wax. His target remains focused on the altar, leaning on a gnarled staff, and dressed in ceremonial white. <EOS>
<BOS> You didn’t really want to let go of your coin like that, but you couldn’t risk being searched. You’re just glad he wasn’t a greedy asshole. <EOS>
<BOS> "So wait, am I still wanted there?" You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You struggle to get back up and lean against the wall as you address her. <EOS>
<BOS> Heather leaves and you’re finally left alone. It’s been a busy day. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, lesee… the ECS rep is supposed to be here tomorrow by carriage.” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> Two things you think about first is that she may be right in that going to the Fel Temple is a bad idea. If they were willing to help Rook (no matter how reluctantly) they probably aren’t going to listen to someone who isn’t actually a follower. <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sigh) Fine. I’ve never told this to anyone before, but for you I’ll do it. Okay, here it is, I’m fucking cursed.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, good. At least you’re not paralyzed then. I would have hated to have to put you out of your misery.” <EOS>
<BOS> Still, they’ve been contributing enough help to “lend” Shadow Blades to act as extra protection. Them, along with Bolt and Rook’s own shadow magic abilities are going to make him quite formidable. <EOS>
<BOS> “Heeeeey youngster! (hic!) You got any spare….coppers fer the faith?” <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” <EOS>
<BOS> It seems we have a visitor. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’ve generally been having a fine time without her constant bitching, you’d be lying if you said you didn’t still think about her. She was fun in a lot of physical ways, it was just about everything else she did that made her less fun. <EOS>
<BOS> “Just because the man’s a pussy doesn’t mean we need to kill the guy.” <EOS>
<BOS> Vera probably just got really wet right now as she grabs your hand with her other one. <EOS>
<BOS> The pitiful defense of the Imperial soldier is no match for you. Your sword tears through the white and gold armor, dying it in a burst of red. You become a blur, moving through the battlefield as a typhoon, wreaking havoc in your wake. The Empire commander orders his men towards you, normally a sound tactic to surround the enemy’s leader, but all he does is bring more men for you to slaughter. Those that try to run from your sword receive a shadowy blast through their chestplate. <EOS>
<BOS> You immediately go grab your savings stash and shove it in your pack, while Annah has already picked up her dog and took off. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh he didn’t go far. He actually lives in the Klyton sewers. Abandoned part granted, but he’s actually part of the reason why the militia doesn’t patrol down there that much and only in certain areas. Ol’ Scales isn’t very welcoming to intruders to his home.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Who the hell are they?” <EOS>
<BOS> “As I said Zamed has been privateering for the Delantium Kingdom and he was contacted by Peter who is still trying to amass a conquering force of men and ships to take back his birthright. In fact Zamed is supposed to be organizing the majority of a flotilla of Hessla privateers” <EOS>
<BOS> “Felian, followers of Fel, god of shadows.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…it was. It’s been years now and for the most part I do get on with my life, but there really isn’t a day that goes by that an image of her doesn’t briefly pop up in my mind. I don’t necessarily always feel the loss, but she’s there in my head you know?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> Vaughn leaves and it's just Zalmora who keeps looking at you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh I can think of better things to do with her mouth.” Another says. <EOS>
<BOS> This isn’t the work of someone with just a crush. This is obviously an obsession and the fact she got the goblins to do it, means she’s not just crazy she’s dangerous and that’s a bad combination. <EOS>
<BOS> Captain Wren’s lips kiss down her neck to meet the warmth below. His callused hand grips a breast as his mouth meets her firm nipple. She moans, softly, an inescapable sound that only excites Wren even more. His hand grabs harder, massaging quicker and with more passion. She wants him, he knows it. He could have had her either way, but this is better. Effort from both parties: that’s the way he likes it. His hand moves between her legs and finds it wet, ready, waiting for him to enter. All in good time. He is just getting started. <EOS>
<BOS> All that remains is somehow warning Gloom about the orb. It’s going to be tough considering you convinced him to take it in the first place. Last thing you want to happen is to arouse suspicion from him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well, off you go son.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay. It’s been what, like a decade that they haven’t taken an interest in this place ever since they lost their chapter here, now all of a fucking sudden I’m receiving letters and having to meet with their reps.” <EOS>
<BOS> “As far as I know.” <EOS>
<BOS> Camid seems to react positively to your explanation with no hint of any underlining hostility. He either means it, or he’s subtler than you gave him credit for. Either way, it would seem the matter is closed. <EOS>
<BOS> You take a drink and try again. <EOS>
<BOS> "Five thousand...seems a bit greedy. Isn't that against the will of Joachim?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Well what?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Got it boss." Vaughn remarks and leaves to carry out your orders. <EOS>
<BOS> “I was out hunting and I come back after a few days only to find that another man is trying to steal MY woman!” Ardan exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not today.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You groggily open your eyes and realize you’re in a much more horizontal position from when you first closed your eyes. After getting the blurriness out, you see a finely dressed woman with tan skin and long curly hair before you. <EOS>
<BOS> As you leave Madeline to her sadness, you move on to your next unpleasant task and that’s speaking to Camid. You’re not entirely sure how you’re going to tell him though. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey kid, any new blood you need me to check out and make a final decision on?” <EOS>
<BOS> Your light illuminates enough that you can see a figure far behind you half hanging over the edge of the abyss. She doesn’t answer she’s just struggling to get back up. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re also concerned with Madeline’s possible mental stability if she was willing to go to this much trouble to be with you. <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sob) You…you know (sob) don’t you?” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Dad can I start calling myself a prince?” Kol asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m sure there are potions to help. Quick trip to the apothecary and all that.” <EOS>
<BOS> Vera at this point has collapsed completely inside the circle and she begins making horrible screams and wails as her body begins to bleed not just from every orifice, but also from her pores. <EOS>
<BOS> You see a few people who you assume are Crimson Talons, but they’re either completely passed out or look like in various stages of being drunk or hung over. Bottles of spirits are all over the place and now you’re starting to wonder just how “powerful” the Crimson Talons are really supposed to be. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hold on! SHIT!” Vaughn shouts as he gets out of the way of Jake and yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> "But she will live!" you marvel, "this is what I long for, most." <EOS>
<BOS> She steps away from you and before your eyes you see her disappear in a small red flash. <EOS>
<BOS> You must finish the dream! It can't be lost! <EOS>
<BOS> Zal's face is one of surprise. Vaughn is a little surprised as well. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well Flint, this is your lucky day. You can keep all your cargo, I’ll just be taking this one.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm. Anyway, take off your clothes, I really want to get to this.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What the hell?!” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, but I do. Now shut the fuck up Marco, and what’s the problem here?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, it’s an inn close to the docks area and they probably aren’t getting much business anymore what with less ships coming in right now. We can use that as our meeting and planning place for right now.” Tanya says and puts her hood back up. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why? Is the militia on your ass? Should I be worried?” <EOS>
<BOS> "I knew it! I knew I knew you from somewhere...well not you per say, but I knew your father, we had a few classes together at the university! You look almost like him! How's he doing?" The clerk asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You think you need to keep this all in the family so to speak. No need to hire a bunch of pirates who might not be reliable anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well they’re a group of elves for one thing and I think you know how unruly those fuckers can get. It’s mainly why this band doesn’t play many places outside the few locations around the campus that are prepared for their brand of wild shit since most tavern and inn owners don’t want to deal with them. Now the plus side is they’re going to draw a crowd, believe me. I’ve seen it multiple times.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well the Klyton council just increased the city’s militia numbers recently and stepped up patrols. So keeping business in the sewers is about the safest place to do all this if we want to avoid sudden raids.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well nowadays I’d say that wouldn’t exactly be the term I’d use, but yes we do have a working relationship. In any case, your views on her school are not my concern; you can take that up with her. I’m just glad that you agreed to meet me.” <EOS>
<BOS> Heather and her much smaller group are already there to meet the Felians. <EOS>
<BOS> You get to the ground floor and begin to search the downstairs cautiously and methodically, all the while grabbing whatever looks valuable. By the time you’re finished, you’ve more or less filled your pack, you’re starting to think that Warts had the right idea after all, but you decide you’ve pushed your luck enough and that it’s time to go, even if there is a second floor to loot. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s still dark, but even from your prone position and in your one eye that hasn’t closed shut you can see a figure running about on the second floor balcony and throwing more daggers. It has to be Tanya. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I guess this was worth it then.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Come on, let’s get out of here,” Seth breaks the silence. <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve survived a lot in this city and sometimes you wonder if it really is Yag rolling well for you, but you’re hoping that you really are just that good at all this. <EOS>
<BOS> “You fuckin’ bitch…” Klint utters and somehow manages to sit up and grabs Annah’s arm. <EOS>
<BOS> Knowing how Hank has a predilection for young girls, you attempt talk up some of those first. <EOS>
<BOS> “The big statue with the sword? I was over that way too and still didn’t see it.” <EOS>
<BOS> Brother Samuel frowns. “I don’t remember you being funny. Maybe this is a trap,” he comments. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s a nice idea, but this all seems pretty damn expensive and keep in mind we still don’t even have control over all the criminal activity here.” <EOS>
<BOS> You soon get to Keira’s home which isn’t large, but you suppose it’s big enough to serve Keira’s needs since she’s living here alone. She gets a fire started and you welcome the warmth since you’ve been near freezing since you got out of the water. <EOS>
<BOS> “Where are you?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I was just thinking, I over heard some of the Black Hooks saying once that there was an abandoned dock not far from this temple that nobody uses anymore. We could probably fix it up. Strong arm some carpenters and wood workers to do it and get some of our people to do any extra needed labor.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> Zamed doesn’t look too concerned about going by himself and just shrugs and follows the Delantium soldiers. The one who was speaking now turns to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe not, but I’d like to get to know you better. I mean you think I’m a complete fucking idiot? I know that your little demon aura or whatever is probably affecting me, but that’s really not having as much of an effect on this as you think. Especially since I don’t just think about us in a sexual manner. I think about us just talking and…” <EOS>
<BOS> She then follows that up with a fairly passionate kiss and rhythmic motion of her body. <EOS>
<BOS> You suppose there isn’t much harm in going to see what the Crimson Talons are all about. Still, you’re going to take whatever Tom is saying with a grain of salt, because on top of all the other lies he’s already told, you have a hard time believing that he’s really all that important in the organization. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point you’re getting annoyed with Sneak’s disappointed routine. Especially when it’s meaningless. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why? What, did you think I was going to do, rob you blind while you were asleep and leave?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Doesn’t everyone? You’re arguably better known than the Mayor of Jicol, ol’ whatshisname. Probably more popular at this point too. Surprised you haven’t just taken this city over, or what’s left of it anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> “…oh wait. Shit. You’re in the slave trade again aren’t you?” <EOS>
<BOS> He speaks in a softer tone. “Great evil follows you. I thought you’d be safe here. I don’t know why it wants you, but it’s coming.” <EOS>
<BOS> “False king,” your mouth lifelessly speaks. “Your simple parlor tricks may fool the common soldier, but they don’t fool me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh no, I’m not getting married at all, this is for someone else.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I say patience, my king,” Mordecai says. “Let the Empire waste resources and manpower sitting at the bottom of our mountain. Eventually there will be a time to strike, but I’m not so certain it’s now. We can last here for many years.” <EOS>
<BOS> “K, hey you lot! Get yer asses over here an’ help us pull dis meat off the trap.” <EOS>
<BOS> "No, but I wish there was another alternative." <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m almost back up, just keep going! I’ll catch up!” <EOS>
<BOS> Annah hands you the drink she’s holding when you get inside. <EOS>
<BOS> Has to be done though because this has gone on long enough and if Tanya genuinely has no interest in you then you’re not going to stick around just to have something you desire greatly dangling in front of you everyday and can’t do anything about it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad to see all of our intimacy together meant so much to you. Asshole. I dunno why I even came out here to find you! Sorry we can’t all be like your perfect sister. Bet you remember where you first fucked her!” <EOS>
<BOS> Year 26 <EOS>
<BOS> “Nice enough hmm?” The wizard replies, “you have no idea. Best you just forget that woman; else she involves you in all sorts of trouble.” <EOS>
<BOS> On top of it all you still don’t know if Annah’s dead. You’re so tired. You can’t even process all of it anymore. You have to rest. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah hits you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, you’ve already lived much longer than someone marked by a succubus. Now I imagine in your case it helped immensely that you developed a loving relationship with this Tanya before she fully changed, but I’m sure you still feel the loss correct?” <EOS>
<BOS> “You still could start using the title, it’s very awkward and weird when I’m addressed as Countess, while you’re still going by something so…mundane.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> But he ignored it, and turned his face once more to the sun and the endless sky. It might mean death to fly the frozen skies, but for his last day he would have pure freedom again. <EOS>
<BOS> Not much you can do about it anyway at this point. You suppose you could go to Hessla anyway since she might have been lying about not going there, but it’ll be long walk since you don’t even have money for a carriage there, of course that can be corrected pretty quickly. <EOS>
<BOS> Several of the corpses you just passed are now getting up and they’re all making their way towards you. <EOS>
<BOS> The throne room of King Aeric is ablaze with news of the most recent attack. For more than a decade, the Empire’s troops have tried, and failed, to capture the nation’s capital. King Aeric’s keep sits at the top of a mountain. It’s a nightmare for the king’s mobilization, but even worse for attacking armies. The keep sits at a high enough elevation that Aeric’s mages can easily pull the moisture in the air into drinkable water. The magically created food is an acquired taste, but it’s definitely better than starving. <EOS>
<BOS> It doesn't occur to you until the elephant you ride on doffs his hat to a chicken before flying into the sunset that you are dreaming at all. <EOS>
<BOS> “I appreciate that, and your invitation.” <EOS>
<BOS> With the Felians broken, any of them alive after that point flee their temple and the city itself. Which ultimately leaves you and the Baroness to combat this religious mad man. (The Dornans continue to remain fiercely neutral and refuse to see anyone, remaining behind a magical barrier around their temple. <EOS>
<BOS> After a bit of searching you find the medicine you’re looking for and immediately down the stuff. It’s foul, but hopefully it works as intended. Just in case, you grab several more bottles of the stuff. <EOS>
<BOS> You already got an agent that reports on Klyton so that’s no problem. Delantium however is another story since Percy just said the ECS killed everyone you sent there. While you don’t want to piss off the ECS severely, you also don’t like being told where you can’t go. <EOS>
<BOS> Wasting no time, you take advantage of his still prone position and use the heel of your foot to bring it down on Reginald’s nose. If you didn’t break it the first time, you certainly do the second. By the third and forth time you’ve stomped it into mush. <EOS>
<BOS> A feeling of dread overwhelms you. <EOS>
<BOS> Something about this seems familiar… <EOS>
<BOS> "What?! But isn't he your employee? Can't you just order him?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad to hear it. I suggest you go tell everyone of your good fortune and meet me at Nightfall in a day for your payment.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Pain? Shit yeah I’m in pain. You fucking gave me crotch rot you dumb whore!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well for a criminal organization we aren’t exactly diverse. Granted I don’t know much about running something like this, but I have heard the old Crimson Talon glory day stories. The Talons used to have fighting pits, used to sell Green Lotus and Yellow Devil, we had whores, I mean a whole bunch of shit that brought in a steady revenue of coinage.” <EOS>
<BOS> With Vera by your side, a new prospect on the horizon and your “condition” either subdued or gone completely you’re feeling more positive about the future. <EOS>
<BOS> “What am I going to do, call the Holgard Watch?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Don't worry boss. That wouldn't happen." Camid says. <EOS>
<BOS> That’s not to say that it will be easy of course. You’ll need to arm yourself with something a little more substantial than what you already have there. For this, the wares of my armory are yours for the right price. Feel free to use the Traveling Map to come back here anytime, to upgrade your arsenal or sell things you might pick up during your adventure. <EOS>
<BOS> “Somebody what?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh shit.” You say to yourself and immediately turn your head towards the direction of the chandelier. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, okay…” <EOS>
<BOS> "They missed you." Niro whispered, and scrambled down from the egg. It was larger than he could reach his arms around, far larger than the ones inside the Court. Niro found he understood - the other eggs were newly found, collected in the Court by the Muses, possibly empty. Dragons, Sphinxes, Griffons - terrible monsters, perhaps, but also fantastic creatures the Muses hoped to settle away from the humans. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, I guess since you’re here, might as well take a look at you. Indeed I’m currently the only one here to do so. Come with me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit. I was hoping I was hearing things when I heard my name being called. Especially when not that many know it. I can’t do anything for you. Your wounds are too severe and there isn’t enough time.” Grayhaze says. <EOS>
<BOS> You are really not thinking straight however. The drugs in your body combined with being pushed into aggressiveness and some unknown factor that’s really causing you to have bloody thoughts, and it’s a volatile combination. <EOS>
<BOS> “Never mind all that. What happened to you?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Three of them jumped me and I had to defend myself.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You what?” <EOS>
<BOS> “If you manage to do that, I will certainly take your organization’s right to exist in Holgard into consideration.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Is that so? Well I’m not sure if murdering potential members was a good way to go about it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well if everyone here isn’t satisfied with how things are, why aren’t changes being made? I mean Tom even said he was going to start reorganizing the Crimson Talons.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You Bolt?” you ask which causes a smirk across his face. <EOS>
<BOS> Well looks like Rook wasn’t a liar and he came through. Almost makes you start to wonder WHY he’s being so helpful. He doesn’t fit what you know about the EC at all. True, this is probably just all to get you to rat on the Guild, but it still seems above and beyond. <EOS>
<BOS> “You my friend have a very interesting imagination! I assure you, if we wanted you dead, we wouldn’t even be talking right now. You are partially correct though.” Percy says. <EOS>
<BOS> However that magical moment of passion in the ruins of a structure dedicated to a deity of shadows, leads to a very average outcome. <EOS>
<BOS> You decide to go with a half truth and explain that you’ve been hearing the concerning rumors about you and Madeline and you’re here to dispel them, because it’s not healthy to the organization to have something like that spread around when it isn’t even true in the first place. You explain you have no interest in Madeline other than her work on the project. You even sort of imply you’re actually trying to get back with Zalmora. <EOS>
<BOS> “Garrick! Put that down!” Tanya shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, okay, I’m suitably in the mood if that was what you were trying to accomplish, I think we better get to the summoning room before the magic happens prematurely.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, you didn’t get in any trouble?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well if we moved to a better neighborhood, we wouldn’t have to sneak about like this and I don’t like living at the Welcome Mat, there are a bunch of whores, drunks, and dregs of the city that live there.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I…” <EOS>
<BOS> “The only true god.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wow, orcs huh? That takes some courage to go toe to toe with the likes of those big green guys.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re not exactly on friendly terms with the Felians, but you’ve never really had any problems with them either. Your issues with them are just like you have with any religion and that’s that you find them to be too restrictive. Honestly, if you had it to do over again, you might have sided with the Yagites since they seemed the least fanatical, though even Warts didn’t think much of them claiming that people shouldn’t organize to worship Yag in the first place. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck that, you’re on your own!” you say and just continue running ahead. <EOS>
<BOS> You figure you can always talk to Tom later, but Zalmora might not be in the mood later if you turn her down now. She’s actually attractive in a trashy sort of way (Sort of reminds you of Annah in that way), it’s just she seemed sort of inaccessible since she was several years older and never paid much attention to you before. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes, it was a sad day when Olaf passed a few years ago. Died right here in the office in his sleep in fact. He will be missed. But anyway his son Olaf Jr. has been following in his father's large footsteps and I don't mind saying he's been doing a fine job for me and his own mother is very proud of him." <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you a worshipper of this…god?” <EOS>
<BOS> You nod. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um…there’s a cart over there which should help you get it in all one trip.” The driver points out in an attempt to be sympathetic to your plight. <EOS>
<BOS> Suddenly, Scales slashes Zal’s neck open and throws her body aside like a rag doll and before you can even shout out he’s grabbed your hands causing the egg pieces to fall to the ground. <EOS>
<BOS> Having gotten your loot, the pair of you leave as fast as possible. You both stop temporarily just before you get back to your neighborhood. <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re taking a break from your failed talent search, you run into a more familiar face. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya, I KNOW something is going on with you. I’ve known you since you were girl and I know when you’re more troubled than usual. I mean if you don’t tell me, I can’t help…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Certainly couldn’t hurt.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ll leave you to it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “She might not have been, Fel might have seen fit to give her a little help, hence why the boy has powers.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I did? Geez, sorry son…but this is different! (hic) Some…somebody…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, there’s a fucking shitload of qweepas!” <EOS>
<BOS> You need to get the hell out of here. The longer you stay the more chance you’re going to get caught. <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh? Oh yeah, sure!” you say and immediately move on to more important matters. <EOS>
<BOS> And the pair of you are left on your own. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re half tempted to go on without Warts, you’re still holding on to the slight hope that he actually knows where he’s going, so you start looking for a tree to climb and sleep in. <EOS>
<BOS> “Warts! What the hell are you doing here?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah yeah got it.” You say trying not to be excessively dismissive. <EOS>
<BOS> After a week of looting the male dorms you decide to change it up and move on to the female dorms. You’ll have to be more stealthy considering you can’t just wander about as freely in there, but you’ve been doing this long enough now that you’re confident that you shouldn’t have too many problems. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah, yes I can see where that would be a concern, but I assure you we have no dealings with them even if the Temple of Fel has been considered the Syndicate’s traditional ally. As you know while we are faithful to Fel, we believe in following our own path. We are your allies, not the Syndicate.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Where are you going?” Vaughn asks. <EOS>
<BOS> This seems to put the Kol at ease and he goes to sleep fairly quickly. You and Vera however definitely don’t that night. The pair of you can’t sleep so you both engage in the usual intimate pastime, but after that fails to completely distract you, you both go check on Kol, who is actually sleeping pretty soundly. <EOS>
<BOS> After spending more fun time with Zalmora, you do eventually get around to speaking with Tom and just like Zal predicted, he’s actually receptive to your ideas. He says that it probably would be better to start reigning in the loot and pillage tactics in the city. <EOS>
<BOS> The temple of Fel here could very well become an arm of the Syndicate again, maybe not today or tomorrow, but when it happens, you’re going to be in a much more dangerous position. <EOS>
<BOS> You were pretty careful about avoiding those before and burning the smaller patches that were in your way earlier, but now you’ve fallen into right into one big patch. The webbing is incredibly sticky, and now you’re having a hard time even moving at all. <EOS>
<BOS> You continue your trip to the exit, trying not to look at any of the people having sexual encounters along the way. Several times you have to push people away after they grab at you. Eventually you just start punching them, and for a couple of them that just turns them on even more. <EOS>
<BOS> Seeing as you don’t want to be bothered hunting down every petty criminal in Holgard, you assign Warts that task. As strange as it may seem, he can be fairly convincing to those of similar low status. <EOS>
<BOS> You clutch your scarf tight and pick your way to your tent in the dim evening light, trying not to raise any undo attention. There aren't many people about, which helps - most of the major merchants are in town sleeping or trading, and so those left at the caravan are mainly poorer passengers who can't afford an Inn, servants, and guards. <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t say that actually. I just said your idea has some merit. It’s at least thinking in the long term. Scales could certainly track down Jake and kill him. I would imagine he’d also scare everyone else into coming back or even better a return to following the original plan of sending the spoils of their activities to us on a regular schedule.” Zal says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes we do. In fact you hired him already once." <EOS>
<BOS> Their after dinner ritual half complete, they then pass the chalice around and take long drinks from it. You take your own turn, repressing a shudder as you down a few gulps. At least most of it is wine, so it isn't too thick. And though it is disgusting, it doesn't turn your stomach like you thought it would. You almost feel rejuvenated, like the rigors of the hard trek through the mountains never happened at all. <EOS>
<BOS> "The old bitch is dead. Vaughn head over to the house with some people and search it for the tavern deed and anything else valuable. I would have done it myself, but I wanted to distance myself from a crime scene as soon as possible obviously." you say. <EOS>
<BOS> Great, now all you have to do is go find some starving artist types. <EOS>
<BOS> The garden was a large one, however, and such a trip would take over a week. In actuality, it took two, as several days were sunny and bright, forcing the slug to take shelter under bushes, rocks, and stumps, huddling in the damp but drying soil. And one day, it rained so heavily that the trek became mud, so his slime became near useless for travel. <EOS>
<BOS> “I am not finished with you yet,” Samuel begins to reply. <EOS>
<BOS> “Heh. Guess it is a step up. I dunno. perhaps one day. In any case, I’m really happy to see you again sis. I missed you a lot. I was just thinking not too long ago about how almost everyone that played an important role in my life, good and bad, was either dead or gone. Glad to that you’re one of the few that are still around. <EOS>
<BOS> "I want that one," the mage says. <EOS>
<BOS> Rook interrupts you and you realize you’ve already given away too much. <EOS>
<BOS> “Rise,” the Unbroken commands. “We have much work to do.” <EOS>
<BOS> “NO! I’m not cryin’ like sum sissy elf! It’s all dis dust bein kicked up due to da battle! Anyway, we’ve known each other a long ass time, made a lotta coin, did a lotta stupid stuff, an’ in sum cases even saved me from getting’ killed. Sometime youz waz an asshole, but you still were better than most an’ especially anyone in da Spiderfang Tribe. Yer, the closest thing I’ve had to a friend, an I’d rather our parting of ways go with me knowing dat yer on yer way ta Jicol rather than dying here over nuthin’.” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> "By the fucking gods! Is it really you I see there before me?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, and I already came to the conclusion that I never was really close to most of them anyway. True, maybe I saw the Guild as my family in some way, but ultimately I was pretty much always alone. I never bothered to interact with any of them except on a job and still always kept to myself. I’m sure you saw that as well.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re not filled with confidence that you’re going to survive whatever is to come, but you sure hope whatever they have planned its quick. <EOS>
<BOS> After a couple weeks pass you finally get to your destination. An even larger ship is in the all too small harbor of Seabreeze. That one must be Peter’s. Between his ship and the Traveller, there’s barely any room for the small fishing boats to squeeze in. <EOS>
<BOS> “Remember what we said! You fuck up and I’m gonna fuck YOU up! You hear me you little shit? I’ll be on your ass! I’ll be on you ALL fucking night and day!” <EOS>
<BOS> “And what the fuck was I supposed to do Lloyd? We had a manpower shortage, and I was getting no fucking help from the directors! Those fuckers have been sitting on their fat asses in the Delantium Kingdom for so fucking long they don’t even know what it’s really like to struggle any fucking more. The Temple of Fel is an ally to the Syndicate and apparently the only reliable one I have right now besides Bolt here. And THIS asshole, who I may have put too much trust in, apparently just took it upon himself to waste two of my best distributors!” Rook says turning his attention to you. <EOS>
<BOS> As you enter the city walls, alarm bells ring throughout the city. You don’t see many civilians; the shut doors and closed shutters alert you to their location. It seems the news of your arrival traveled quicker than expected, although it’s likely the people boarded up as the Empire’s main force went to meet Seth. <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sigh) Fine. Here, take it! Take it all!” you exclaim and hand over most of your coins to Annah, who takes them without blinking an eye. <EOS>
<BOS> “Does it matter?” <EOS>
<BOS> Year 30 <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you suggesting an attack? Because while I know around where he’s currently located, I’m not entirely sure of the exact area. He may have even moved since he has to do that a lot anyway. Fairly certain not only would he have the advantage, but even if we win, we’re going to suffer heavy losses which sort of defeats the purpose.” <EOS>
<BOS> “How is that different than the brothels we run?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Whatever just shut up and keep moving.” <EOS>
<BOS> He of course has no problem in finishing off a target that can’t fight back. <EOS>
<BOS> “The heat was still pretty bad, so we decided to lay low.” <EOS>
<BOS> Barro's horses won the first event, the obstacle course. Rom's horses came in last - though they amused the horses by playing with the barrels and bars. <EOS>
<BOS> You begin with a description of the orphanage Tanya grew up in and the apathetic lady who ran it. You mention how Tanya had to beat up two older boys when she was six because they were accusing her of stealing their food. After she broke one boy’s arms and the nose of the other boy, the other children remained afraid of her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, but that’s the other part of your story I don’t entirely understand. Why the hell are the Neroth cultists have such a damn hard on for us anyway? I mean granted we aren’t buddies, but it’s not like we’ve gone out of our way to fuck with them.” <EOS>
<BOS> As you struggle, the door to the room is suddenly opened and there you see her. Madeline. <EOS>
<BOS> “Probably not. I want to say though it was very wise of you to address Elder Flynn in a respectful manner and I even understand your feelings on this matter.” <EOS>
<BOS> You check, and you see his head at an unnatural angle. He's broken his neck. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “And you’re still fucking that elf that you don’t want anyone to know about.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What?!” <EOS>
<BOS> "Approach," the Wyrm Empress says. <EOS>
<BOS> I have asked myself if I’m trading one evil for another, if I am becoming the embodiment of everything I oppose. Such thoughts are detrimental. I cannot burden myself with questioning each action. I can only act in accordance with what I believe to be the right action. Still, I keep a healthy level of introspection, but similarly to the power, I do not let it consume me. Each attribute is but a tool at my disposal. I use it when it is necessary, but never allow the tool to become me. I am the master of my fate. <EOS>
<BOS> These raids are practically slaughters and you're not particularly getting any thrill out of doing them especially since there's barely been any loot to be had. Last raids you did go on we're more about scavenging the town's fruit supplies and medicine rather than valuables. <EOS>
<BOS> You hold your hands up in protest. "I'm nothing special, just an old storyteller." <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, so whatcha callin’ it?” <EOS>
<BOS> Of course while you’re trying to do this one of the mounted orcs appears and gallops straight towards you. You try to get back in the carriage to avoid being trampled or cut down, but instead the orc grabs the last javelin on his back and throws it at you. <EOS>
<BOS> “I just explained there’s a shitload of profit in this!” <EOS>
<BOS> Before you can respond you’re suddenly interrupted by a familiar voice. <EOS>
<BOS> But one day, as he was eating on a mushroom under a shady log, a piece of parchment fluttered down beside him. At first the slug thought it was a bit of falling bark, and slid over to eat it, but quickly realized what it was. A piece of the map! But why here? <EOS>
<BOS> You pass by the other one you shot in the back of the head and towards the one still screaming about his leg. Except now, he’s not crying about his leg now so much as he’s begging for mercy. <EOS>
<BOS> “You think? Don’t you know?” you reply. <EOS>
<BOS> When you’re feeling slightly better you insist on walking about the village which Keira is happy to see since she doesn’t feel the need to check up on you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera…Vera…shhhhh…calm down…I’m not going to hurt you.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Ah, I see. Buying your way into the afterlife. Whatever. I don't care, but I'm afraid five thousand is fucking unreasonable." <EOS>
<BOS> “Rally the men. We march forward.” <EOS>
<BOS> You eventually get out of Holgard and with your hands you dig up your private stash that you hid in the nearby wilderness. You figure you got enough coin for a trip to Jicol though you’re going to have to walk to the nearest city which Klyton. <EOS>
<BOS> "See? This was useful info. And YOU got angry when you found out Vaughn was going out with a militia man." Zal says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, I got good news and bad news.” Teklis says. <EOS>
<BOS> The scent of brine and fish fill your nose as you feel a mermaid latch on to your back as you try to swim away. You can do nothing as you feel scaly fingers start to dig out the wax you stuffed in your ears. This is followed by a lick and a nibble on those same ears. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah goes on to tell you that she’s getting bored of Klyton and wants to see more of the world. She says that when she first came to Klyton she initially wanted to live here for the rest of her life, believing it to have everything she’d ever want. She then says its funny that masquerading as a university student caused her to learn more about the world and how she wants to see more of it. <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t try to have you killed! I just wanted us to be close again! You were supposed to retreat back to Jicol, not stay here and be the fucking hero of Holgard!” <EOS>
<BOS> “No. I love this woman. Why would I want to be free of that?” <EOS>
<BOS> And of course that beautiful stranger will soon be dead. Just as well as you never learned her name or even saw her face. Makes the fact that you just condemned her to death a lot easier to cope with. Not much that can be done anyway. At least she had fun; at least you believe she did given her squeals of ecstasy. <EOS>
<BOS> A lot of the wooded area that used to surround Holgard is gone now thanks to years of Ludmilla expanding the roads and building the fleet to protect the city. Just as well as Warts runs his trading post now as he won’t get many offers as a guide anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> He smiles when you get to his desk. <EOS>
<BOS> “This relationship is a really bad idea. And I’m not talking just for the survival of this organization, but your survival in general. This girl is not just obviously dangerous, but she’s manipulative as well. You may like the attention you’re getting from her now, but you might not like it when you realize you don’t want it anymore. And when that day comes, it isn’t going to be good.” <EOS>
<BOS> Movement catches your eye. Your gaze is drawn to center stage where Brother Trevor begins the announcements. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, yeah, laugh it up.” You grumble. <EOS>
<BOS> An idea comes to you and you wait for the caravan to reach your location. It gets a little closer and then stops completely. A couple of the men on horseback speak to someone in the carriage and then both of those men ride out to meet you. Both of them are carrying crossbows and wearing full plate mail. No insignia though so they’re probably mercenaries. <EOS>
<BOS> Being smaller and a whole lot faster than the zombie villagers definitely helps. You duck and dodge through them as they close in, grasping and clawing at you, but none of them manage to get a lasting hold. <EOS>
<BOS> “We weren’t doing this straight out of the womb, sis.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, nah. I’d just like my thirty gold pieces.” <EOS>
<BOS> After a few moments of running and backtracking, you’ve managed to make it home and lose most of the ones that were half heartedly trying to nab you, but it won’t be long before what passes for real law enforcement around here is beating down your door. You only have a short time to gather what you can and get the hell out of here. <EOS>
<BOS> You tell him stories to pass the time. Even if he could hear you, it's doubtful he could understand you. But you spin him stories anyway, ones of Fiala tricking the demon king into locking himself away for sixth months out of the year so that the land can flourish, and of their great hero Erik destroying a pirate fleet threatening the country of Caven, and of Tarus wrestling a great dragon and flinging him into the night sky. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh no? You don’t think that this little idea that you came up with isn’t some shit she whispered in your ear? Contrary to popular belief around here, I’m not the damn fool people seem to think I am. You don’t think she hasn’t tried her little feminine wiles on me long before you showed up and got me out that cage? So since this is probably all her idea, SHE can be the one to do it!” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re not used to stomping about the jungle area outside Jicol and unfortunately you end up getting turned around and lost. <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno…” <EOS>
<BOS> You nod. <EOS>
<BOS> Ragar’s target turns, pulling the hood from his head, revealing his face. Wrinkles span his cheeks. Horizontal lines, evenly spaced apart, rise from his eyebrows to hairline. His green eyes sparkle innocently, not moved by the apparent threat before him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey not everyone can afford the high priced Klyton brothels. Look, I saw that the only way we were going to survive is to have steady businesses. The Klyton Council are the biggest criminal overlords and nobody says shit because they effectively legalized everything and control the biggest gang to protect their interests. I mean there wasn’t really any way to feasibly compete except offer similar things at lower the prices and cater to the lower class.” <EOS>
<BOS> "You'll have to excuse the captain, he just really hates set backs. It's really not as bad as all that, we'll hit a few easy targets and in time things will start picking up again." Scully says in a positive tone. <EOS>
<BOS> “But obviously you have issues with this.” <EOS>
<BOS> You are so close! There has to be a way. <EOS>
<BOS> "Thank you," you say. "I have just started out on a Pilgrimage, and would ask shelter in your magnificent Cathedral." <EOS>
<BOS> Right along the idea where you left the fucking inn because you didn't want to settle down and live like some regular jerk off. Would it really have been so terrible? It couldn't have been worse than THIS. <EOS>
<BOS> "A student?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “You won’t hear it from me. You’re the boss, you can do what you want obviously. Camid wasn’t exactly popular so it isn’t like this is going to cause the eyebrows of other Talons to rise. Fairly certain most of them would have killed him to fuck schoolgirl as well, if they had the chance…but then SHE was the one that set that up isn’t she? You must be awfully special to her.” <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya at this point intervenes and tackles Garrick and you all go tumbling on the floor. <EOS>
<BOS> With a lynch mob starting to form, you do the only thing you can and that’s run. Which you notice Annah has already done and left you to fend for yourself! <EOS>
<BOS> He’s obviously forgotten his outrage at you. Fortunately he may have even remembered to take your advice about washing last time since he smells half way decent this time. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ren, you oughta be glad anyone even pays for the misfortune of staying at this shitty establishment!” you hear a voice chuckle. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wut? Dat’s a terrible idea.” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya wipes her eyes and nods. <EOS>
<BOS> Rook has never followed up on your last meeting, you don’t know exactly what his game is, but you imagine if you come in for help, he’s going to want that inside information on the Guild. <EOS>
<BOS> “Long story.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Nothing! Sheesh, I mean we are walking together and sometimes I’m going to look over at you. You really need to relax, you’re going to see that Keira loves you, not me.” You say trying to calm him again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Your taste for the theatrical is most amusing,” the muffled voice of Horne speaks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Come back to me my love." The voice says in more melodic tone. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well mom has always stressed how nice my voice is and how creative I am. And I think you know I’ve been practicing my lute a lot more lately. I figured I might be a bard…” <EOS>
<BOS> “He’s been killed! A lot of people have, you need to come this! I think it’s an attack!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well…it would seem you are just full of surprises and here I was thinking you were just another pretty face. But to answer your question, I do believe they have their sights on it, but not necessarily through force. Something about annexing it peacefully so they don’t have to waste the manpower. Probably through the help of one of his children, but given how treacherous they all are, that’s not necessarily a certainty. Still, whether they take it or not, the Baron himself is going to be out of the picture soon. There is a growing discontent in the air by every faction and everyone that has an agenda there. He can’t possibly keep control for much longer.” <EOS>
<BOS> You might as well be talking to a brick wall. <EOS>
<BOS> On top of it all you aren’t sure what happened to Annah though knowing her she probably blamed you for everything. You’re so tired. You can’t even process all of it anymore. You have to rest. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh ho! Well at least I can still fit into my clothing from twenty years ago! What the hell have you been eating?" Your sister remarks poking your belly a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wow. Didn’t know that, but isn’t the Baroness a dedicated follower of Fel?” <EOS>
<BOS> Taking a risk, you draw your dagger and try to stab his weapon arm so he’ll at least drop it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Isn’t that what unconditional love is all about?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah, here we are, just up these stairs and through that door.” Tom says. <EOS>
<BOS> Now you know why the mercs were smirking earlier. <EOS>
<BOS> You get out of the carriage and start unhooking one of the horses tied to your carriage. The driver who is still nearby sees what you’re doing. <EOS>
<BOS> And there it is. You have to admit, you're only half surprised, but this is terrible timing. <EOS>
<BOS> Captain Wren spits blood from his mouth to the ground beside him. “We have an...unconventional informant.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck, that is some cold blooded ruthless evil shit that a Neroth cultist would be proud of. I can’t imagine what she did exactly to piss you off. She did piss you off right?” <EOS>
<BOS> Mr. Reynolds flashes a smile at you, which really puts you at unease. In fact you’re starting to smell something not unlike brimstone. And that smell can only mean one thing. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not this time. I’m going by myself.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What new evil is this?” Prince Ragar whispers. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yep…thinking with your dick. Gets you into trouble every time. Though I gotta say, hasn’t gotten me in quite the same trouble.” <EOS>
<BOS> And that’s saying something considering you used to have sex with a succubus. <EOS>
<BOS> You finish the letter by telling them you love them and if they see sis, that you love her too. <EOS>
<BOS> It is during this speech that the Felians, attempt to launch one more direct attack upon him. Shade himself even leads the charge. You would have helped had you known about it, but coordinated efforts between you and Shade haven’t been the best since you agreed to join him in the first place. <EOS>
<BOS> “Could be worse. I mean Fel’s an asshole, but at least it’s not Neroth right? However, I think I can help you. It’s going to cost you though.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Dunno, but who cares, he’s killing their side!” another says. <EOS>
<BOS> You suppose you could be big enough and out of the way enough that a take over might be considered costly for them and not worth it, but you can’t help but believe that they’ll try anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I suppose that’s all true, though I had good reasons for everything.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “It is for the most part it is, though officially it’s ours. Really it just gets spread around that this is neutral territory to keep the new non-aligned thieves feeling safe. You’re not exactly the only new one that’s come through here thinking they don’t have to join a side if they want to continue to ply their trade. You’ve just lasted longer and shown more skill than most.” <EOS>
<BOS> “TANYA STOP! DO NOT KILL THIS WOMAN! I COMMAND YOU!” you shout. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re putting a lot of trust into Tanya right now… <EOS>
<BOS> Time passes and eventually in-between the moaning and grunting, suddenly Heather begins to cough and she starts to wheeze. <EOS>
<BOS> “You don’t mean that, Sarah. Our guest is banished from the territory until he learns information from this man. The King’s orders,” Richard says, placing an arm around Sarah to calm her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad to hear it and don’t worry, you’ll have as much help as you need to rebuild this place. Come to think of it, we do have a surplus of slaves. Maybe Jicol could start using such cheap labor on a regular basis. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to see an old woman who has probably been wondering where her supply shipment has been for months.” <EOS>
<BOS> You leave Warts and head home to the Blackheart Inn. On your way to your room, you toss a bag of coins to the innkeeper stating that you’re going to be having a “gathering” on the weekend and you need . He doesn’t ask questions since he knows by now what sort of man you are and more importantly all the coin you’ve given him is understanding enough. <EOS>
<BOS> “Warts, I think I should form an organization.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Didn’t think you’d be interested given how youz got yer mind on other things. Got a daughter too, Zuggins. Twins actually. That’s another reason why Snuffit wuz so pissed at me. Hey, didn’t youz say you were a twin?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well I’ve got something I need to do on my own and I can’t be creeping in and out of sewers to do it. Where’s Yinen, I might have a few things to trade with him.” <EOS>
<BOS> “True. You had better sense than that. Well if that’s all, I should be getting back. Have to train these folks in battle magic after all, I assume if you come across and new information, you’ll share it.” <EOS>
<BOS> Not many apparently, as most of them don’t even bother replying and just leave. <EOS>
<BOS> As soon as you’ve said that, Vera’s eyes light up. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the fuck you banging on the door like the city watch for? Wait…Tom? What the fuck are you doing here? Weren’t you taken to cages?” <EOS>
<BOS> "And little time. I fear the mages will destroy us, soon, once they find a way." <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmm, well that style would favor road robberies a lot more. It’s still not really what I’m about though.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Both of you shut the fuck up, in fact don't the pair of you got some work to do? No wonder things are falling to shit here." <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, but I’M the lead commander here! And I think it’s time to pay the coin, have you brought it with you on a baggage cart somewhere?” <EOS>
<BOS> You look down a bit and frown. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 18 <EOS>
<BOS> Going to be a little weird without her around you think, but life goes on. After all you didn’t expect her to come with you in the first place. <EOS>
<BOS> Ever since the invasion last year, Heather’s demeanor has changed considerably, though you imagine her premature aging and heavy task load don’t help… <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, didn’t expect to bump into you. I didn’t realize you left the party too. Figured you were bedding some aristocrat or something.” <EOS>
<BOS> Better you should at least make some other alliances first before taking on the slavers. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s my boy. I think it’s time. Look.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ardan! Listen to me! I’m not your enemy!” you shout, but he isn’t listening. <EOS>
<BOS> Seems like now more than ever she’s attempting to use you as a pawn. Granted she was allying with you for mutual benefit before, but this seems a little different now. What exactly is she planning? <EOS>
<BOS> "I think that can be arranged," he says, and looks at you pointedly. "Better make it 50, though - you girls could get her a bit of bread at mealtimes, yes? It's probably best if she doesn't run into anyone." You dig through your pouch and pull out the silver, sighing at the large bribe. <EOS>
<BOS> No sooner have you done that, when they start shouting back and it looks like they’re prepping spells. <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well.” He answers. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, you shot off half of his fucking face five minutes ago. Though, I guess maybe I am now. I’m Vera. What the hell do you even want?” <EOS>
<BOS> “But…but what about the slave trade? You said you were going to be in charge of that!” <EOS>
<BOS> Rook’s body drops to the floor and you also hear the noise of a bolt going into Rook’s desk. If you hadn’t moved, that would have gone right into you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Klyton is just her current place residence, but her real home is…well it’s very different. You might even say it’s a different realm altogether.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose that’s true. Do their parents know about this?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Idiot. Anyway, see? I told you there was going to be a trapdoor.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Well that was easier than you thought. <EOS>
<BOS> “Actually I’m not, but I’m not sure what difference it would make to you if I was.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well to be fair, you can’t blame her. I’ll come with you, but as far as I know I’m still banned from the place ever since I stole a bracelet for my sister’s birthday. Of course that was before we decided that the town was completely off limits.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I hope I cracked your fucking skull RAPIST!” Annah continues to shout. <EOS>
<BOS> “Zal, I’m not gonna just…fuuuuuuuuu….” <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t recognize your gods and that’s not how it works! That’s not how ANY of this works!” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmm, odd. They look like something that you’d find in some tribal village. I’d say Sotakian, but these don’t look reptilian enough and I’ve never known the lizards to have craft stuff out of valuable material. You got Ivory, jade, gold, silver and platinum here. Wonder if they’re a complete set. Well I’m sure I’ll find someone interested.” <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s what I’VE decided.” <EOS>
<BOS> She appears to be back to normal. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, you suppose you could have wound up in a worse city when you got stuck here. Galapolis is the shining jewel and seat of the Empire and it’s easily five times the size of Holgard ever was. There is no shortage of opportunity for a rogue like yourself here. Crime doesn’t change too much after all and if anything you’re probably a little more skilled at it than most. <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course you did. And I imagine you’re also here for another good reason. So what is it that you want?” Heather asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “No! That’s not what I’m saying. I’m saying…gah…look it’s already happening and unfortunately it’s probably going to happen from time to time anyway. Even if I get that enchanted ring for Kol, I can almost guarantee he’s going to take it off at some point when we aren’t around. Maybe he’ll be curious, maybe he’ll be pissed and do it to spite us. I’m already envisioning what a problem he’s going to potentially be when he gets older what with his magic abilities. I’m just thinking that MAYBE restricting him too much is an exercise in failure. I know it obviously was with my parents.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Your sister goes first and briefly goes into some of the places she's been. She says she actually passed through Holgard at one point, but of course she didn’t know you were living at the time. <EOS>
<BOS> One month later... <EOS>
<BOS> Mr. Reynolds sniffs the air around you a bit and then speaks. <EOS>
<BOS> You stand up and begin firing wildly at the sailors though Heather is easily destroying them with a chain lightning spell. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh well, the Syndicate’s loss for being too slow when opportunity called I suppose. Doesn’t happen often, but we hope to correct that by hopefully having a working relationship with your organization.” Percy remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> While Gwen walks away to get Heather, Vera squeezes your hand a bit. The pair of you wait in silence and soon you see Heather slowly walking towards you both, yelling at Gwen about something who goes running off elsewhere. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah! How ya like that goblin fucker? You mess with us an, SHIT! AAARGH!” the young man starts to say before you grab his finger which he was still pointing at you and break it. <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re getting undressed, you’re mentally preparing yourself for all this. Sex in front of an “audience”, sacrificing a former friend, summoning your demon ex, lifting a curse…it’s a lot to all process. If anything you’re slightly concerned not so much of finishing to quick, but getting started! <EOS>
<BOS> The students make quick work of most of the remaining demons that do insist on continuing their attack. Meanwhile, you’re making your way back down to go meet up with the students now that the demon threat is over with. <EOS>
<BOS> “It doesn’t matter,” you answer. “Our task remains the same. This shaman has proved a valuable asset to the Empire. Striking him down will be a significant blow to the beast.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I can see how you would, but I can’t say I do. Why the hell are you even here and obviously pissed at me?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Thanks…but where did you get this?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> After a month rolls around a Syndicate collector comes by and asks for the thousand, very no-nonsense and anxious to be on his way. When you name drop Percy, just to see if you can get any information on what might have happened to him, the rep says he doesn’t even know the man. You pay him with the chest full of coin and he’s on his way. Nothing else is mentioned or happens. <EOS>
<BOS> Blood has now sprayed all over the place and you feel the crushing weight of a dead body falling on you. <EOS>
<BOS> You see what Annah is talking about. It’s a hanging cage along side the road. <EOS>
<BOS> “You seem to have a lot of interest in me all of a sudden. Is this personal, or did Elder Flynn send you on behalf of your temple?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Mice and rabbits? Those are mere snacks," the lion boasts. "I can take down a cape buffalo, or larger!" <EOS>
<BOS> At this point the candle light in your office goes out, immediately causing you to yell out, but no sound is made and instead you feel a blade going into you several times before you can even draw your weapon. <EOS>
<BOS> “Perhaps. You the leader of this lot?” you answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Neither did I, this was sort of sprung on me at the last second. I was however told by a subordinate that Peter…” you start to say before you’re interrupted. <EOS>
<BOS> After Warts leaves you motion Vera to speak which she does though she’s still a bit hesitant to do so, fearing that you’ll make fun. <EOS>
<BOS> Rob seems a little more receptive to this and says he'll try to do his best. You say he's free to go and as he leaves you tell Vaughn to stay behind. <EOS>
<BOS> The soldiers are still trying to chase you on horseback, but it’s proving a little more difficult with all the people in the way. The funny thing is they’re actually doing MORE damage by trampling over several citizens in their efforts to get to you! <EOS>
<BOS> “Grh. Well…maybe I do owe ya some thanks…I’m not given back these rings you paid me with though!” <EOS>
<BOS> You run through the streets of Sivak, crashing and bumping into people along the way. Surprisingly or maybe not so surprisingly nobody is really trying to stop you on purpose, the average citizens seem to be more concerned with getting the hell out of your way. <EOS>
<BOS> Even if you take Jicol, you’re still left with its naval forces. Who knows if they’ll just surrender or not. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera suddenly slaps you. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya looks at you a little sympathetically as she leaves with the rest, which is definitely not the norm, and part of what you imagine is the problem Garrick is having with you. <EOS>
<BOS> "See? Solid!" Rob says. <EOS>
<BOS> You figured showing her the more practical and direct aspects of the job, she’d be more appreciative, but this character flaw of bitching non-stop is making you rethink this too. <EOS>
<BOS> “Marco and his crew were also genuinely in danger at the time so it was a lot more believable that they needed help.” <EOS>
<BOS> You pull out your pistol and shoot the man you were speaking to in the back. This is soon followed by several other people pulling their own weapons and others just outright running away. You put down those that attack you and probably scared everyone, but you don’t think you convinced anyone. Even Warts apparently ran off during the shooting. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sorry,” you mutter, helping her to her feet. “I’d watch your language if I were you. The monks don’t like bad words.” <EOS>
<BOS> “This one’s mine,” Richard says, pointing towards the smallest of the huts. <EOS>
<BOS> “Did you even warn anyone that there might be an attack soon? Or did you just pick up your shit and run as fast as you could as soon as you figured it out? In fact aren’t YOU the one who said Garrick was a fool for having too much of a moral code?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> You explain your dealings with the Ebony Claw Syndicate, constantly pointing out that you are NOT actually a member and that you haven’t even done anything that would harm the Guild, though you wonder if that even matters anymore given that Tanya just killed Garrick. <EOS>
<BOS> "Pity," she says. "How do you manage, then?" <EOS>
<BOS> You go to Virgil’s room and knock. When you get no answer, you just pick the lock and open the door. You find him predictably passed out. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good work, Horne. Keep an eye on the perimeter. I’d like some sort of warning if others will be joining us,” Seth answers. <EOS>
<BOS> "Hey, I wasn't joking yesterday when I said it isn't too late to seek Joachim's forgiveness. Maybe your wicked deeds are profiting you today, but there is going to come a reckoning someday and you'll have to answer for your evil ways. Out of respect for your parents, I urge YOU to turn from this path before it's too late." <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, so what’s this information? Because if it’s some big guy that was looking for me, I already know because Virgil told me.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright. I will do whatever it takes to bring the Empire to its knees...but our partnership ends with the Emperor’s life. Don’t think for a second that I trust you, Lorthander,” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, I think this place will do just fine." You say to yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> Been a weird night for you. Granted you’ve had more than your fair share of such nights, but this one will probably stand out in your mind. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah! Same here. So, you ready to go?” <EOS>
<BOS> “You sayin’ you don’t have a secret personal stash?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Fine." Spryce and the captain head up, leaving you alone with the patient. <EOS>
<BOS> “So why the hell aren’t we doing more then and why isn’t Garrick being pro-active?” <EOS>
<BOS> So much for Annah changing when she got to Klyton. You sometimes think you’ve gotten to her and she’ll stop bitching so much, but it’s always just temporary. You really miss working with your sister. <EOS>
<BOS> Zal smirks at your offer. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t have anything against Layla. In fact you were the one who told me she was a good idea and I eventually agreed with you! You didn’t even freak out about this until I brought it up just now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why have you let an infidel inside our sanctum?” another adds. <EOS>
<BOS> “Again, I suppose it’s up to you and I’ll support your decision, but I feel like this is also going to take time away from combating the JCR.” <EOS>
<BOS> “She’s still fucking annoying. If she didn’t show such natural talent for magic, I’d probably just throw her ass out of the school.” <EOS>
<BOS> While the remaining Felians realize that this is a lost cause and attempt to run, you do you part in shooting a few of them while your hob crew enthusiastically cuts down these lesser Felians that have more fear than fight left in them. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora starts laughing immediately after her comment. Vaughn stays silent though. <EOS>
<BOS> And again, and again, and again, until he’s lost his strength to even stand anymore. And then with all your strength you sink the blade in the back of his damned neck severing his spinal column from the rest of his head and through the front so part of the tip is coming out. <EOS>
<BOS> As you lie gurgling and bleeding to death you see the enforcer spit part of your flesh back at your face. <EOS>
<BOS> With the first part of your plan in mind, you head to the Welcome Mat where you hope Virgil is still living. <EOS>
<BOS> A vibration on the web is felt as you’re still fumbling around in the dark and you look just in time to see a very large mass descend upon you. You can’t see it clearly, but fear over takes you since you know what it could only be. <EOS>
<BOS> "And why would I sell to a heathen like you?" Wendy retorts. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not sure why you’re bothering with that thing. I could have killed you several times over already and that’s even before you actually woke up. My name is Shade.” The figure says. <EOS>
<BOS> “No! (sob) Please! I don’t wanna die! I apologize! I… (sob)” Marco screams. <EOS>
<BOS> - A local bar, the Whiskered Rabbit, is having an open talent show. The first prize, as determined by a panel of judges and a vote of the crowd, is a handsome 500 silver, and there are some lesser prizes that will be awarded as well. While you can expect there will be a lot of competition, the chance for that much coin all at once is compelling. <EOS>
<BOS> “This,” she spreads her arms wide at the mess of clothing on the floor. “And I train with the advanced students.” <EOS>
<BOS> Rook doesn’t elaborate on that, but you stay silent. Rook watches you for a moment and then speaks again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey. You here about the job?” the woman asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t like moving and I like living here for free too so I feel that helping you achieve ownership of this place should cover my rent for a lifetime.” <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t exactly know where Tanya’s running to, but you continue to follow her and eventually she stops somewhere secluded. Then she start going through her clothing. <EOS>
<BOS> “He rich?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I’ll bet…so you were saying this big ass lock on my cage looked easy?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well unlike the rest of that Varsakken clan, I’m actually in control of an entire island rather than just a city. I think that calls for a higher title status.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re not sure what to do. You worry exceedingly for your mother and father though. Are they still alive? Are they OK? <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t reach Dreadcage until nightfall, but when you finally reach it and exit the wagon, you can see that it definitely lives up to its name with the massive walls, towers and high fences. <EOS>
<BOS> “So. You’re going through with the ritual huh?” Heather asks you. <EOS>
<BOS> She tells you that everything is fine, but she herself has been preoccupied lately with a power struggle from some upstarts trying to start a new organization and the Jicol law enforcement being more vigilant as of late. <EOS>
<BOS> You turn around and as quick as you can in the darkness put some distance between you and Scales. You don’t look back, though you soon find that you don’t need to because you hear a noise followed by a great whipping force hitting one of your legs which takes you off your feet. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah, got that right. So, I trust you’re stepping aside then…” Metger says and starts advancing with his buddies. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm. I know who you’re talking about. Never trusted him.” <EOS>
<BOS> You then dump the contents of the bag on the floor and several bloody frozen heads roll out. This is met by gasps, shock, silence and one person surprisingly even throws up. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s fine. Just as long as it isn’t infested with vermin. I’d rather get a bit of rest without potentially getting bitten. (Yawn) So how far is it…apologies what’s your name again?” <EOS>
<BOS> “You, Lorthander, created the Unbroken?” you ask as you come back to reality. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, a couple blocks south of here sir. The Fancy Tickler” Claire responds. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, over to the west. There’s a big statue. You can’t miss it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well make the most of it kid. Just out of curiosity though…who did you supposedly kill?” <EOS>
<BOS> “No! I don’t mean that as an insult! You were fine and enjoyed all the closeness and it was pleasurable, but somehow I was expecting more given how much people talk about it.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Been waiting a long time for this. Say hello to Vaughn in hell when you see him and don't worry your snitch bitch of a wife will be joining both of you soon too." He says and then puts a bullet in your head. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?! No! That’s a stupid idea! I told you, I’ll take care of it by myself, I don’t need your help, let alone the help of my enemies.” Tanya shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> Third day in Klyton and you figure Ahmed should have his shit together by now and you’re ready to get this taken care of completely. <EOS>
<BOS> “And I still will be. Nothing’s changed on that front. I’ll just have a midwife or some shit nearby. Y’know I think one our people has some experience in that matter. Apparently she was the oldest of fifteen siblings and had to help deliver most of them. Can you imagine? I’m telling you right now, we are NOT having fourteen more of these fuckers.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Perhaps, but it my experience the gods do things in their own time and as a mortal I can’t wait that long. In any case it would seem that perhaps Fel has assisted in the more direct destruction of the immediate threat that are the Dornans.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, didn’t realize you were a theologian. How do you know all this?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “But…but we’ve got her! She can’t do shit right now! I can kill her and then you’ll finally be free, isn’t that what you wanted?” Gwen remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well…at least I’d feel like we were at least contributing to the economy in some way as opposed to just feeling like we’re running one big rape factory.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya, I can throw him out of the Guild, if he’s been bothering you again. Honestly I would have done it sooner had you not told me not to after that stunt with the Neroth cultists.” You hear Garrick say. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the fuck’s it to you pretty boy?” he answers. <EOS>
<BOS> Seth is troubled, not by the gathering Empire soldiers in front of him, but how the hell did they know he was coming? The darkness of night should have protected them from being seen. They moved quietly, no one should have heard them. And yet, the Empire was ready, prepared for his assault. Nothing ever goes your way, huh? Better for the kid to have stayed. Better for him to live. Seth grits his teeth and engages the next soldier. How did they know we were coming? <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I suppose you would know about that. You never told me all this about having a family and shit.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re not understanding me.” You say almost immediately realizing your poor choice of words. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?!” <EOS>
<BOS> "Apologies sir, but I'm still having a hard time being completely sober right now. It's been awhile and I feel sort of weird." <EOS>
<BOS> “You keep interesting female company since we parted mortal. Based on the mewling waif, the old hag over there and the meat chunks on the floor apparently they’ve all been a bunch of treacherous backstabbing bitches, pathetic naïve weaklings or both. No wonder you still long for me. At least even with my infernal heritage I never lied to you.” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 17 <EOS>
<BOS> “No, hadn’t planned on it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Someone from the past. You’ll see.” <EOS>
<BOS> And after a week, to the disappointment of your many young fans, you bid farewell and return to the docks, almost sad to be leaving Pefallis. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera smiles a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> “I told ya, I heard something.” <EOS>
<BOS> “In the war. You’re no friend of the Empire, yet you don’t seem aligned with Aeric either.” <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t resist. You embrace Tanya as she guides you down to the floor, still continuing to press her lips against yours. And once again you begin to feel the effects of her succubus kiss. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, I told you that YOU needed to convince me. So convince me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Down on luck huh? You should pray to Yag more. Anywayz five gold. Final offer.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Dunno why you think this makes you more hidden. I found you in the woods.” Annah remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey! I thought you moved to Holgard!” Virgil says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah? And what of it? Listen you little shit; you’re just some small town snot nosed punk. You know exactly fuck all about what it means to be a Crimson Talon. If you don’t like the way we do things, you can just leave. Not like you’d be missed.” <EOS>
<BOS> You might as well go together at this point, you knew he wasn’t going to be the ideal partner to begin with. Who knows, maybe you can use him as bait or something. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ugh. Hate those pretentious fuckers.” <EOS>
<BOS> You spend practically the whole night at the place. <EOS>
<BOS> You meet a few other milling crew members, but they don't say much to you other than some grunts. One of them mentions where the sleeping quarters are and says don't worry about which hammock to take because most of them are no longer in use anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> "Trickery, you mean." <EOS>
<BOS> “Nah, I’ll come back, I have to go get the coin anyway. Come on Kol.” <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you dump Lloyd’s body somewhere in the backyard and turn around to return to the mansion only to find the Shadow Blade leader standing before you. <EOS>
<BOS> "Glad to see you're a woman of forethought. Anyway, I'll be back later and I'll inform you with more details as we get set up. I trust you can tell your brother about this business when he shows up?" You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Better dat den assassin blades.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Me? I have no idea, but I’m going far away. I won’t be coming back either.” <EOS>
<BOS> He curls himself up in his blanket and turns, ready to sleep at last. <EOS>
<BOS> “I was thinking of Jicol.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well? Aren’t either of you coming in with me?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “The Syndicate won’t care as long as the this deal is pleasing to them which it should be. As for the Order, well the goals and the Syndicate’s goals clash at times. It’s an ongoing struggle, but I believe with this deal, your son will not be whisked away in the middle of the night or something similar.” Toz replies. <EOS>
<BOS> Later you go to the Temple of Fel to speak with Gloom about extra back up. Gloom as usual is always willing to assist you. You’ve always felt Gloom was way too friendly to be a Felian (Even his name is ironic) but better cordial than hostile you suppose. <EOS>
<BOS> Other than those possibilities, you’re drawing a blank of who might be looking for you. It’s a little concerning though. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey greenskin, how much further is it?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> You get just in range and then that’s when you see his fingers slip followed by a yell. Your heart sinks and you can only hope that the drop wasn’t as far as you think. <EOS>
<BOS> Twenty gold coins up front just to deliver a package and more reward afterwards seems like a pretty good deal. Plus the making connections bit is what entices you a bit more. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t move.” <EOS>
<BOS> You stand up and start to leave. <EOS>
<BOS> “What about him? Oh you worried that your son is some chosen one or something? Let me tell you about Fel, he’s like all the rest of the gods, doesn’t really give a shit about any of us except as a source of amusement. You worship him or something?” <EOS>
<BOS> You smile at this parting gift from Tanya. <EOS>
<BOS> The closer you get to the carriage; you see that it’s pretty ornate looking. Obviously the merchant who owns this one is very wealthy. When you finally enter the carriage it’s even more luxurious inside. Soft fur lines the seat, the curtains covering the windows are silk and the carriage floor and ceiling are gold plated. A perfumed smell also fills interior. <EOS>
<BOS> “You…(wheeze) fuck…” he utters as he weakly grabs you with one hand and attempts to get his eye patch off with the other. You have no idea why he’s doing that, but you hardly care. <EOS>
<BOS> The room again erupts in debate. In the past years, you’ve become accustomed to the ale-empowered arguments of Aeric’s war council. You imagine Brother Samuel would enjoy these types of debates. The thought brings a tinge of sadness to your mind, but you quickly focus on your breath to clear the emotion. <EOS>
<BOS> "So how did it go?" Zal asks. <EOS>
<BOS> "The muses aren't here," a soldier whispered. "We should get back and report the location." <EOS>
<BOS> Tom sits down and exhales deeply, rubbing his face. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, maybe that was unnecessary. But I can’t just forget what you did. However, I do think I know how you can make it right, but it might be a little too weird for you.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Now Rook and Bolt both look over at hapless Lloyd who is now on the verge of shitting his pants and you haven’t even gotten started. <EOS>
<BOS> “I know.” <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, you put Vera’s inviting mouth out of your mind and refocus on business, which involves going over the ideas that were proposed to you by Vera and Warts in the first place. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah surprisingly (and reluctantly) shuts up. <EOS>
<BOS> “ROOK! You’re not seriously listening to this?! This man has told a story about Mr. Dream and Dreamweaver being snitches! Now he’s claiming we were all ripping you off!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck, alright! Alright! You win, I’ll stay here. If there isn’t going to be an invasion I guess it won’t be…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Is she involved with someone else?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “We ain’t your fucking messengers!” the man says and before he can lay another hand on you, you pull your pistol. <EOS>
<BOS> “But there is ALWAYS choice! I just know you’ll make the right one! I’m going to give you a sum and you can tell me if it’s fair or rip it up. What you can’t do is negotiate though. I’m afraid I’m not here to do that.” <EOS>
<BOS> Several bolts whizz by you and for a moment you think you’re going to get away and then you feel a sensation in your head. <EOS>
<BOS> Peter looks at you and leans in. <EOS>
<BOS> "...you..." Is all you can utter. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m right here….oh shit. Fuck! What the hell did you do now?!” your dad says walking into the room. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, but she’s very cranky.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well last I heard Klyton isn’t exactly that great for rogues like us and Hessla is a piss poor pirate town. The Delantium Kingdom is Ebony Claw territory, so that doesn’t give many options to expand.” <EOS>
<BOS> Ardan now moves towards you and he looks fully intent on using that axe now. <EOS>
<BOS> You pull the hood away from your face and head over to the Monument of Muses. Sitting on the edge, you wave a hand and call in your loud stage voice: “People of Dreaming Village! Harken to my tale!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey boss. There you are. Guess you found the party a lot more interesting than I did after all. What happened to you?” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I guess let’s go then.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Um, does this mean those of us who owed gambling debts don't have to work here anymore?" One of the "indentured servants" asks. <EOS>
<BOS> As you approach Tanya’s quarters you hear voices coming from it. You slow your pace and strain your ears to listen and eventually hide just outside her door. <EOS>
<BOS> “They’re in a vulnerable state so they need all the help they can get right now. However, they’re still very dangerous. In fact I thought that with their new leadership, they would soon collapse altogether, but as it turned out they have proved more resilient than I thought. They’re attempting to rebuild and I’m not just talking about their numbers, I’m talking about their influence in this city.” Gloom remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> The problem now however is you are completely lost. You’re not even by the river anymore and you’re reluctant to retrace your steps lest you run into your greenskin friend again. <EOS>
<BOS> Speaking of Fel, you’ve been checking to make sure Kol hasn’t been having any odd dreams or anything. So far so good, and Grayhaze’s medallion is obviously working. He still casts his little shadow tricks every now and then, but again nothing major. You figure in another couple years he’ll be ready to start learning from Grayhaze’s book proper. <EOS>
<BOS> “I guess I should be flattered.” <EOS>
<BOS> While one of the mounted mercs bashes in the head of a bandit you take the opportunity to shoot him while his back is turned. The merc’s armor is of no protection and he cries out as he falls from his horse. <EOS>
<BOS> “Couldn’t we use it to get into the Jicol harbor?” <EOS>
<BOS> Fortunately so far you’ve managed to avoid the attention of any group mainly due to focusing on stealing actual coin and dealing primarily with a non-aligned fence by the name of Yinen for your stolen valuables. You met him at the Hell’s Own Inn where you still reside at. Funny thing is you didn’t seek him out; he came to you asking if you needed a fence. <EOS>
<BOS> "Elzu, non Caven emcallus fiedra, ni Torus eru Fiala," the wounded man mutters. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?! But you can’t! I mean…who’s going to look out for you? Don’t you know how dangerous it is out there?” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “You didn’t need to speak to Hank, I would ‘ve done that, but thanks for saving me the trouble. You’ve certainly been more than helpful today.” <EOS>
<BOS> Wendy's survival instinct kicks in a bit and she tries to struggle, but it isn't much of one. <EOS>
<BOS> Happily Gertrude seemed to have a nice sized sapphire on her, which should definitely cover the cost in addition to the gold you do have. Since it’s one less thing for you to worry about, you figure you’ll go in and just wait in Grayhaze’s shop for the remainder of your time here. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sometimes, I don’t need a master lock pick or safe cracker all the time. Sometimes honeyed words will do.” <EOS>
<BOS> Her hair is fixed up and she’s dressed like she’s the daughter of some rich nobleman. Looks like she put all that loot you gave her and indeed bought herself something nice and apparently she’s bought a dog as well. You never knew she wanted one of those. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay your qweepa lost. Pay up.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “True.” <EOS>
<BOS> The yell stops and you slowly look over the side. <EOS>
<BOS> But today is different, for it will be your last day in Dreaming Forest for some time, perhaps forever. You sit and drink hot Franjia tea, just watching and taking everything in, as if drawing each aspect of the scene on the folded papers of your mind. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why the fuck not? You just said there’s a fucking demon coming to attack us.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Nobody I guess.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Warts mentioned that keeping captives costs coin. I mean how much are we going to be spending to keep them before selling them?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I know this whore or rather I did. Name was Naji. She was that girl that I rescued back when you talked me into ripping off Reginald’s house.” <EOS>
<BOS> After spending a few days in Hessla you also learn that this place really isn't as disorderly as it's reputation would imply. Granted it's far from being as repressive as Klyton, but there actually is a "force" that makes sure it isn't a free for all. The Hessla Headsmen report directly to the governor who apparently is an ex-pirate that controls everything in town. <EOS>
<BOS> “Obviously nearly getting myself killed in order to help you because you’re too proud to ask for it.” <EOS>
<BOS> The man grabs the food with a smile. “I’ll put it to good use.” Losing the grin, he adds, “In all seriousness, I hope you return. You’re a good kid and an even better fighter. Hate to lose you this way.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I’ll ignore the bluster and chalk it up to nerves.” <EOS>
<BOS> After entering and walking through several empty rooms and corridors, you find Madeline by herself, just sitting on the ground. She doesn’t get up, she just looks down at the ground. There aren’t any goblins around though, which is strange. <EOS>
<BOS> “I understand what you’re saying baroness, however even if I take you up on your offer, I don’t think I’m the friendly dragon in the scenario. That would still be you.” You say, causing her to laugh a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> You meet Percy at the same tavern with the payment. Once again he’s very friendly. <EOS>
<BOS> “I thought about it as I was stomping around the sewers, but what good would that do? If the ECS is going to be as pissed at me as I think they’ll probably be, it’s not like they won’t send assassins after me elsewhere. If I’m here and join you guys at least there’s a chance.” You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ve never denied it. Doesn’t matter how many other guys I’ve been with since you, I’ve always said you were the first and will probably be my only true love.” Annah says running her index finger down the side of your face. <EOS>
<BOS> “If we’re gonna do this…go lock the door at least. Last thing we need is more people wandering in and before we know it, it’s not just us any longer.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh right. Yeah I did. So what happened with that?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Speaking of which,” Horne says. “The capital is ours for the taking.” <EOS>
<BOS> The second night, you are called on to give a story for everyone, and happily fulfill the request. <EOS>
<BOS> By the time you sit down at the long feast table, you've worked up quite an appetite. <EOS>
<BOS> Realizing that this is a lost battle, you quickly start trying to free one of the living horses still attached to one of the carriages (and desperately trying to get free of the chaos by trying to drag the carriage despite the fact that it’s dead fellows along side it are preventing such a thing) <EOS>
<BOS> Then there was the time you had to deal with the Joachimites and while Tanya wasn’t there for that, you still had some magical assistance of your own to take out Yinin. <EOS>
<BOS> “You can leave it on the table for now. Pour yourself one while you’re at it,” is his reply as he focuses most of his attention on cleaning his armor. Mira pours a second cup, but doesn’t drink from it just yet. She waits until the Captain finishes his work and picks his own cup from the table. <EOS>
<BOS> “Please, I’m no thief! I’m just a bard and I was just here visiting my sister when the…liberation began. The baroness’ men wouldn’t let anyone leave and killed anyone who tried! Not to mention my sister was scared so of course I stayed with her. When the fighting got really bad even her home wasn’t safe and looters…(choke) took her. I tried to fight, but I’m not a fighting man and it was just luck that I was only smashed in the head and left for dead. I later got up and tried to find her, but…the violence…I never saw so much violence before…I thought of my sister…and…(Sniffle).” <EOS>
<BOS> You walk up to Zal and look into her eyes then you put your arms around her before kissing her deeply. She holds you tightly until you finish and slowly pull away. <EOS>
<BOS> “So what DID happen to you? Did you get caught up in an orgy?” Vera asks with a grin. <EOS>
<BOS> “The Halfling cook I got them from breeds them for food. They apparently eat them all the time in Hessla.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> The horses caught on quickly enough - Rom's generous bribes of apples for the winner and winning team did much to help. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, Tom’s mother was a lesbian?” <EOS>
<BOS> “ Because I can.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No! Of course not! I came here first because I wanted to see what your decision would be on this. I mean look, I understand what you’re saying, but based on everything I’ve learned, the outcome seems grim even if we managed to keep our head down during the initial invasion. But, you’re right too, I am getting all this information second hand, so maybe it would be a good idea to actually talk with this Peter in person, before coming to any sort of decision. If we did, you and I could both make an assessment of whether to throw our lot in or not.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm free," you say. "I am temporarily hear as a stop on a pilgrimage, but I have no official plans." <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh I just came back from speaking to your inn owner Hank. Told him that all about the cheap talent that’s going to grace his inn this weekend. He seemed receptive to the idea. Kept staring at my tits the whole time, I’m assuming if I hadn’t mentioned that I was your girlfriend, he would have tried to touch me as well. Ugh, he’s gross. But in any case everything’s set on this side, I just have to speak with Nature’s Revenge and a few others and this place will be party central.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well if you think I’m going into the woods with you alone, you’re sadly mistaken.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck you. Just fuck you.” <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, you get the strong impression you’ll have to steal a horse before you leave this place. Not before at least another day of rest though. You wander the village a bit more before heading back to Keira’s home. <EOS>
<BOS> She doesn’t have much that you’d want to take anyway, not to mention you’d be quite the scoundrel indeed if you stole from a woman who has done nothing but help you. You aren’t quite that much of an asshole. <EOS>
<BOS> Long have I awaited this day. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why have you called me from the abyss?” Ragar snarls. <EOS>
<BOS> "It's a shame what happened to the muses," he whispers. "But there are some of us mages who still appreciate good stories. I'm glad to see the art hasn't entirely been lost." <EOS>
<BOS> You empty your pistol at Tanya. You know you hit her at three times in the head and that’s enough to cause her charge at Gwen to halt temporarily when she collapses on the floor. Gwen doesn’t miss a step and unleashes her magic. <EOS>
<BOS> “You will? Um, okay. Usually you don’t.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, okay…anyway, the main road’s over that way. I trust youz can make it from here.” <EOS>
<BOS> Well you’ve finally reached your destination and you now have an entire city of corruption to perform your work in. First thing you’re going to do though is find that inn Warts mentioned. You’d really like to sleep in a proper bed if only for a little while, then you can take it from there. <EOS>
<BOS> The one who just took away your weapons holds your dagger up in a threatening manner. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Ivani, my love," you stammer, "there is so much to talk about -" <EOS>
<BOS> You gather a few belonging, some money and leave the inn. You figure Zal can fill everyone in on the changes she intends to make. You can't imagine how much she's going to have to deal with, but you know Zal's got a strong will and mind, so you're sure that she'll succeed or at least come out ahead. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fucking greenskins.” You exclaim, kicking the dead body. <EOS>
<BOS> "Ah. Well, it is a niche item, not easy to market. I can give you 175." <EOS>
<BOS> At first you wonder if you’re seeing some city in the Delantium Kingdom since you’ve never been there, but something about this place seems different. Like you don’t think you’re even in the same time period. The people are dressed very different than you know. The building architecture isn’t like anything you’ve ever seen. <EOS>
<BOS> “I want this place, that’s what I want.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you sure this is safe?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, it’s true! I really do have feelings for you, I just was too …argh, it’s a long story. Just you gotta believe me on this.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, interesting. Well, I suppose we’ll gather the rest of equipment.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Bah, none of doze gods compare to Yag. No point worrying about shit, when you’ve run outta luck, yer time iz up and that’s all there iz to it.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Really? Where to?" the boy you heard before asks. <EOS>
<BOS> And so begins “the test.” <EOS>
<BOS> You decide to hold off on sending anyone to Delantium until you get word back from your agent in Klyton. Based on his report, you can make your decision to risk sending some to Delantium or not. <EOS>
<BOS> “So you’ve seen them?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Because I have no real love for the Syndicate. Honestly, I’m just using them for their help in taking back Holgard. I really don’t care if they succeed in their petty revenge against you. That being said, I don’t care about you either. Your organization, if it survives will be a thorn in the Delantium law I intend to re-establish in Holgard and will be dealt with eventually anyway. With this information you could stay and fight which will result in your death either during or after the liberation or you could leave to save yourself. Either way, your organization will not plague Holgard.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shut up for a minute, I’m trying to tell you that I want to join.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Thank you! I had it custom made a long time ago. Always knew I’d get to wear it some day!” Vera says a bit excitedly. <EOS>
<BOS> "(Sigh) Considering I'm actually allowing myself to submit to this, I guess it's just as well I'm getting out too. I'm obviously too soft to be a crime lord anymore." You say as Zal smiles. <EOS>
<BOS> “No she didn’t for some strange reason. She claims you and her were just having an argument, but my boys said it sure as hell didn’t look like that to them. Dunno what spell you got that girl under, but it ain’t gonna save your ass because you’re STILL wanted for the murder of Klint! You were fortunate that his father didn’t catch you before my men did though I wouldn’t have minded if he had.” <EOS>
<BOS> You explain that her and her brother's tavern is now going to be a front for Crimson Talon operations. In exchange you'll fix this place up and make it at least somewhat more appealing. The tavern will be making more money with the influx of people that are sure to come in, but you'll be taking most of the profits of course. <EOS>
<BOS> Captain Novrice sails the Whisper at Dawn. It's a sturdy looking ship, and from what you know of him, he's a good captain with a sense of humor. He's the cousin of your good friend Talsum, a baker, back in Dreaming Village. His fee to sail past Gloaming Isle and reach Scaleport, the port city at the southern tip of the largest northern continent, is 50 silver. <EOS>
<BOS> “Goodbye my love.” She says sadly and then with a quick strike of her finger she rips your throat open and licks your blood as you bleed out. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well you are my wife. I'm not going to live like a regular jack off alone. Especially since it was your idea in the first place." You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> Surprisingly he has another one. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re raising the rent here?!” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Lorthander!” Ragar shouts. “You will answer for your crimes against the crown.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright…I’ll step aside.” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> You’ll be glad when you get to Klyton. <EOS>
<BOS> “No problem, so will you be back next month at this time?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, if you’re cursed, then I REALLY don’t want anything to do with you.” <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Percy takes a big drink from his mug and gives you a big smug smile. <EOS>
<BOS> And to your left, is where you see the owner sitting. He’s a grossly fat berk dressed in fancy colorful clothing and a couple of jeweled rings on his fingers. He smiles in your direction denoting friendliness, but he’s looking at you in a way that…well you aren’t used to. <EOS>
<BOS> “You got it.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Admit it,” Brother Trevor growls. He begins to walk towards your fallen body. <EOS>
<BOS> It slows her down, but not much as she’s already spun around to face Gwen. She stomps on the ground causing the floor to crack and forcing Gwen to jump out of the way lest she fall into the Holgard sewers, though maybe that would have been a better idea. At least then there would have been multiple escape routes. <EOS>
<BOS> The trip to Klyton is uneventful, but it gives you plenty of time to think and even appreciate the countryside somewhat. You haven’t left the city in so long, you almost forgot what wilderness looked like. <EOS>
<BOS> And there it is. The excuse you’ve been expecting. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you kidding me? (Sigh) Fine. Whatever. Here, take this, but not a silver more.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What the fuck are you doing?! We gotta get out of here before those two bring this whole place down on our heads!” you shout. <EOS>
<BOS> "Mm, the imagination is a powerful thing. So where's Junior?" <EOS>
<BOS> In this way, the rest of the time passed until the day of competition. <EOS>
<BOS> “Knew him?” <EOS>
<BOS> After a few hours of just scouting and walking around, it’s much like you figured. A lot of scholarly types with their noses in books and rich kids that do a lot of partying. The dorms have security, but oddly not as much as one might think. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, I mean you dirty whore, you’re fit only to be fucked and killed!” <EOS>
<BOS> You’d like to send a letter to your sister too, but who knows where she is, so you end the letter to your parents saying you send your love to your sister as well and to let her know if they ever see her. <EOS>
<BOS> After a period of dragging bodies, keeping Kol entertained and general waiting around, eventually Grayhaze is finished with her task and comes back with a small black medallion and a small book. <EOS>
<BOS> And it certainly isn’t an orc. <EOS>
<BOS> You peer out the opening to view the landscape. It’s too dark to see the ground. While extremely high up, you can see jagged pieces of rock sticking out from the mountainside serving as natural hand-holds. One by one, members of the raiding party cautiously lower themselves out the window. <EOS>
<BOS> “What’s wrong?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Now this meeting just became a little more serious. Heather seems to know a lot about your situation, but then given that she’s got magic coming out her ass, you aren’t that surprised. <EOS>
<BOS> You leave the qweepa “race track” with your pet and head home. <EOS>
<BOS> The session goes on for quite awhile. While you definitely don’t want to disappoint, you find that you’re struggling in the endurance department, though you’re not sure if it’s because Tanya’s taking out decades of pent up sexual energy on you or again, it’s because she’s part succubus and she’s actively draining your own energy. <EOS>
<BOS> “Counter-attack, Captain. Sorry for the intrusion.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Life’s tough all over.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Maybe. Not sure if I like the idea of taking orders though. I was already part of an organization like that once. Eventually I even ran it, but ultimately I left it because I found I preferred working on my own without a bunch of people around." <EOS>
<BOS> “No, we will not abandon our home,” Kassi states. <EOS>
<BOS> Fighting the urge not to vomit yourself, you desperately try to get Heather off of you, but again she’s firmly wrapped around you and pinning you down. <EOS>
<BOS> But, you still need something to draw them in and make them feel a part of the tale. Those who are invested in a story are more likely to open their hearts to it - and their wallets. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course that might mean bumping into Annah again so that’s definitely a potential drawback, but it’s still a big place and she doesn’t have some claim on it. You’ll try to stay out of her way though if you happen to see her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well as you know the Felians haven’t come to us for help. The best I can do if they do ask for help is tell them that their little war with you is their own affair and not in the best business interest of the League. What happens after that…well I’ll still be here to assist the survivors should they need it.” <EOS>
<BOS> The snail picked up the piece, noting the interesting pattern of squiggles and splotches, and sludged up to the top of the log to get a better view. A giant bear was muching on berries nearby. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora looks at you and starts to leave, but you can already tell she’s not done talking. Story of your life. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m telling you, he’s already developing a little crush on Layla and that’s probably not going to go away any time soon.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Five hundred gold coins, but since I can tell you’re a bit apprehensive about all this, you can pay me after the job is done. If the results aren’t to satisfaction, well I’m sure Tom can pay what he feels is an appropriate amount. Now, why don’t you tell Henry about the job and what you want done exactly?” <EOS>
<BOS> You wander through the slums of the town, sparing a few coins and gleaning what information you can. The homeless in blue are especially forthcoming. There are, apparently, two known underground passages that run from Stone City to parts of Lantern wood. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well...a lot of time has passed and that sheriff who hated you is long dead now. Klint's father also isn't there anymore, so I think you're in the clear legally, but I wouldn't exactly say you're wanted if you know what I mean. Though Annah apparently still thinks highly of you if you want to rekindle that relationship." Your sister says. <EOS>
<BOS> You make it to a hallway and that’s when you’re starting to feel really…excited. <EOS>
<BOS> "You want to celebrate our honeymoon?" <EOS>
<BOS> As for you, you do your best in keeping skirmishers from getting in close. Several of your League underlings don’t survive though and after it’s all said and done, you’re pretty much the last man standing from your group, but the day is won and what little remains of the invasion force flees. <EOS>
<BOS> “No…I look…my head really hurts and I’m a little dizzy…” <EOS>
<BOS> "Dear people of Inrit Gardens," you address them, "I am Dustan the Fabler, the Storyteller of Dreaming Forest. I have come here to regale you with a tale of the fantastic, a story of a princess and a hanging garden. But I must ask you to be my muses for the day! I need an item, precious or plain, something fantastic or mundane. Who will volunteer the object of this tale?" <EOS>
<BOS> “May I sit in on this Elder?” Heather asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I think I’d know if I had killed all those women and some of those were accidents!” <EOS>
<BOS> Surely, there has to be another way? <EOS>
<BOS> “What do you mean?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ll be fine Vera, stop fussing!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, the Neroth cult is getting out of hand and the Guild is having severe problems with them so I was ordered to take out the leader. Been spending a few days staking out his home in an effort to figure out the best approach, but he’s got guards every fucking where.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, you know how I feel about you. And you’re saying you have feelings for me, so isn’t this the type of shit couples are supposed to do for one another? Help each other out?” <EOS>
<BOS> Vera was right though, she is pretty. <EOS>
<BOS> Whatever punishment the Grandmaster gave, it would be worth it. Brother Samuel rises from his seat and follows the wisp down the hall of books. The white glow from the Master of Archives, in combination with the blue torch light, casts sinister-looking shadows from angles of differently shapen books. The two arrive at a small section of the bookcase wall. The Master of Archives circles in the air for a moment and then flies directly into the wall. The light vanishes instantly, leaving Brother Samuel alone in the blue. <EOS>
<BOS> “WHAT?!” <EOS>
<BOS> You look over at your wizard allies and all of them are alive or more importantly Heather is still alive. She’s looking even worse now though. She’s roughly around your age, and now she looks about fifteen years older. You ask her if she’s okay and she snaps at you which is slightly out of character for her, but you suppose this all has really taken a toll on her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, I was never affiliated with the Joachimites.” <EOS>
<BOS> Being silent weighs heavily on you. Sometimes you tell yourselves stories in your mind to pass the time between patients, but it seems to be harder now to find the right words. <EOS>
<BOS> "ME? This was all Vaughn's idea and YOU signed off on it! I've barely been involved in it! All you've had me do is seeking out other potential taverns to take over and monitor the bum fights from time to time. I haven't stepped foot in that damn tavern since we first set up shop there! Besides, aren't you regularly fucking that skeletal bitch that runs the place anyway? Figured you pumped her for information along with just pumping her." Zalmora exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> "Are you certain of this?" <EOS>
<BOS> “And there you go dismissing my feelings again!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Can’t…gotta…finish…ugh…I feel…insides are on fire.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I wasn’t here that long anyway. Let’s see…spent some time at sea with a nice crew of lesbian pirates...” your sister says. <EOS>
<BOS> When one of them asks what your business is at the temple, you simply tell them that you wish to see Gloom at which point they go check to see if he’s available and fortunately he is so you can get this over with today hopefully. (Along with it going smoothly) <EOS>
<BOS> You haven’t gotten far when a javelin whizzes past you. You look behind and see two orcs in pursuit. You can’t really do much except duck as low as you can and try to outpace them. <EOS>
<BOS> More explosions are heard and now you’re seeing chunks of stone flying overhead. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. Yeah I guess I can understand that. Who needs that buzzing in your ear right? Still, she was sweeeet. I bet you had fun with her while it lasted.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No. I don’t, but she doesn’t deserve to die either.” You say and walk towards the pair of them. <EOS>
<BOS> You head there immediately and find Marco standing outside giving orders though he looks almost as bad as he did when he came back from his foray as a pirate. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ll take care of it. Most of dem are teenagers so be better if I speak to dem. I know what ta say.” <EOS>
<BOS> Gotta love the “outrage” by a bunch of demon worshippers, not to mention the fact that Daniel killed himself by tackling you in the first place! <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, you wouldn’t happen to have any extra water would you?” you suddenly hear one of the slumping figures in the cage say. <EOS>
<BOS> "Quiet in there!" the mother calls from the other room, and the two of you sit in silence for a time. <EOS>
<BOS> While you aren't deterred yet, you're seriously starting to wonder if this is all really worth it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes! Because it’s your ONLY logical move. I am willing to forget all this as…an over protective parent outburst. Completely understandable. I will even work out a better deal between you and the Syndicate. Your son will no doubt rise in the ranks of our order. Just think, YOU will have a powerful ally on the inside, close to the Temple of Fel in the years to come. If you ever have trouble with the Syndicate, you will able to get support from our order to smooth anything over. It seems like a winning situation for all of us.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why?! Just so you can go off with this dickhead? No! How many people have fallen for you Tanya? How many? I’ve lost count. Why does THIS one get your affection?” Garrick screams and then starts laughing. <EOS>
<BOS> “What do you mean?” <EOS>
<BOS> The sergeant tells his people to stop and then you begin to tell your tale. You mention how Flynt came up to you and how you accepted his offer because you needed the money and thought it was just a simple delivery since he never mentioned what was in the package. <EOS>
<BOS> “And we’re gonna start doing things differently around here.” <EOS>
<BOS> You expect Annah to bang on the door or at least yell at you, maybe even cry, but that doesn’t happen. You just hear her footsteps walking off. <EOS>
<BOS> As for your organization’s role in the current religious squabble, you’ve managed to keep out of it so far and you’ve told everyone else to do likewise. This is mainly towards a few ex-Syndicate members that still have leanings towards the Temple of Fel. Though more than a few in your group give a few prayers to Yag too and while you’ve been known to do the same from time to time, you aren’t looking to side with them either. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re mentally preparing yourself for this potential problem for later, Warts is still around asking you questions. <EOS>
<BOS> “No. LOVES you. More than you’ll ever damn well know.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I mean I want us to start completely over together and part of that would be leaving this city and going some place else.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure, I get it. You’re right, there really isn’t much point in me sticking around now, and maybe it is time for me to move on with my life. Gods know I’ve wasted more of it than probably should have. Anyway, I’m sure school girl will be very helpful in your future endeavors. And I sincerely hope I’m wrong and you and her live happily ever after or how ever that goes.” <EOS>
<BOS> Tom barges past Vaughn who follows and then you follow both as they continue to talk. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately nobody else saw it that way. And between the fire AND your very loud arguing and fighting with Annah, someone came to investigate. <EOS>
<BOS> "It's mostly coins, but there are a few personal items some reported stolen. Not to mention we've got more than a few people that said they saw this asshole stealing from folks when he thought nobody was watching." <EOS>
<BOS> You head to your room with no more distractions, and then wearily sit on your shitty straw mattress and count what’s left of your ill-gotten loot. Enough to eat for a few days. <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re trying to pull yourself free, you soon find out that these webs weren’t just made by multitudes of little spiders, or even several big ones. <EOS>
<BOS> "Sure, there's not much to him." The oily man grins, and you can clearly see he is missing over half his teeth. "But he says he can carve, so he's probably good with his hands. Maybe he can mend that mess of a mainsail." <EOS>
<BOS> As the daylight faded, one of the servants cut a honeycomb and shared it among the others. The princess took her share and ate under the mask, letting the wafer melt on her tongue. Somehow it was sweeter than any honey she had had before. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you wake up. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s Spiderfang Tribe actually and they’re still far outnumbered for that to happen. Well, for now at least. In any case, most of them have been migrating to Holgard quite a bit over the years. I guess most are learning that city life isn’t all that bad and you can still be just as much of a violent asshole here as you can out in the wild and get routinely paid for it. Hmm, actually, now that I’m thinking about it, I guess it makes sense that a few of them join the Holgard Watch after all.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Is the Delantium Kingdom coming to take back the city?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hit ‘em fast, hit ‘em hard,” Seth answers. <EOS>
<BOS> The best you might be able to do is find a place with no people about and stay there until the effects of the drink wear off. (Whenever that is) <EOS>
<BOS> "Unfortunately, I still have duties to attend to tonight," he winks. "But she won't take much space, she just needs a place to lie low until the others cool down." <EOS>
<BOS> “This is Mr. Reynolds. I believe I mentioned him the last time we spoke. He’s running for a spot on the Klyton Council.” Ahmed says. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr. Reynolds tells you that the job will be done by the end of the week, and you and Tom can return to his office at that time. You leave the office a little concerned about all this, but it’s done now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, so when does this job begin?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Hm, well that would be an improvement. Speaking of which, now that this place is on the verge of being complete are we moving all our operations here?" <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh. That's good. They were a nice couple, if a bit slow on the uptake as far as how they really felt about each other. Still, I guess it all worked out, given that you're here. You look a lot like your father. Well come on in and tell me what brings you to my doorstep." Wendy says. <EOS>
<BOS> Just your luck, you get there and there’s a long line. Probably all there to get cured from the shit they caught from Randi. <EOS>
<BOS> You bid Tanya goodbye who just nods an acknowledgment and leaves. Since you’ve got your orders to rest, you climb down from your spot and head back to the inn. <EOS>
<BOS> You look around the information desk and discover that not only can the books not be checked out, but the fee for 10 minutes of reading is 1 silver, or 5 for an hour! It makes some sense - even for books written before the sacrifice, some minute fading will happen with each reader. It is why you are careful how often you read from Ivani's own book of tales, lest someday the ink fade past what your aging eyes can discern. <EOS>
<BOS> One of the mermaids has started to undo your trousers and taken the worm in her mouth as it were. <EOS>
<BOS> You can only think that she stole someone’s identity and maybe some forgery was involved. You suppose she could have paid someone to forge something or maybe they just don’t bother checking the records very close anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well no matter, I guess we need to introduce you to the rest and I need to make my formal declaration that I’m going to be running things.” Tom says. <EOS>
<BOS> With as much rest as you’re going to get under these conditions, you and the student wizards are soon on your way to the palace. Heather parts ways with you, but you really wish she didn’t. She still looked very tired for one thing and you’re not entirely convinced that you shouldn’t focus on one thing instead of splitting up. <EOS>
<BOS> When you attempt to leave the facility, you go in the direction where you think you came from, but soon find that you made a wrong turn somewhere. <EOS>
<BOS> No longer exposed to arrow fire, you charge the front gate. Simultaneously, you and Lorthander blast the gate with magic. The mix of shadow bolt and psionic wave shatter the metallic gate. With a screech of metal, the gate implodes, unable to bear its weight in the weakened condition. White and gold armored soldiers stand at the ready, but don’t meet your attack. They assume a defensive position, waiting for you to enter. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re stuck not just in an unknown city or even a foreign land, you’re in a whole other time period! <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, Just as well as you killed that demonkin I suppose. She might have been a bit of a wildcard. In any case you can finish off the rest when you lead the attack tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Tanya and Garrick are just silent as you relay this information. Garrick’s mouth nearly hangs open as he knows you’re exactly right about everything. He can’t believe that you know all this. Tanya even looks a away a couple times. <EOS>
<BOS> They deem it suitable, it seems, and give you a silver ticket. But they aren't the ones you have to please. <EOS>
<BOS> You curse that this didn’t go better. The owner of the Blackheart is pissed enough that he yells about you ruining his place with a mess of bodies. He surprisingly even has the courage to say you’re no longer welcome to stay in his establishment and possibly bringing heat down on his place. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm. Well actually coming from her that IS a kind word. Congrats. At the risk of inflating your ego even more…and she’d probably kill me if I told you…she actually would somewhat agree with you on your views about the Ebony Claw. She sort of wishes we took the fight more to them too. Actually you could probably count me in that group as well.” <EOS>
<BOS> It goes well for the most part, but predictably there are complaints. <EOS>
<BOS> “No no, young one,” the mage tuts, “it is not my doing. I only mean that it’s a miracle anyone survived at all. The villain behind this was quite thorough. It’s really surprising he somehow missed you. Perhaps that will prove to be his downfall.” <EOS>
<BOS> You consider correcting him, but several others walk in and take their places. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, that’s Zamed. He’s the captain of the Traveler. He’s a Hessla pirate, we tend to have business with a lot of them in Jicol, but Zamed’s been about the only one I’ve really taken a shine to lately. Still, it’s just as well as he’s a pirate. Don’t think I’d want him around ALL the time. Best to keep these sort of things free and flexible.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sounds good to me. I’ll meet your assistant then.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I really don’t see how since both can get you killed. However, I do see your point to a small degree. I have been playing it a bit on the safe side. Still, if this is looking to be more trouble than it’s worth then I’m getting the hell out as quick as possible.” <EOS>
<BOS> A day later your body is found by some hobs who were in the League and Warts soon learns of your demise when they bring your body to the hobgoblin village for food where he and the rest retreated to. Apparently you had stumbled into Spiderfang territory after all. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that’s…wait. How did they know I was coming to talk? I didn’t even see any of them on the way here.” <EOS>
<BOS> Seeing as it’s starting to get dark, you half wonder if you shouldn’t just take shelter in here for the night and start fresh tomorrow. Not to mention there could be something of value in there. <EOS>
<BOS> “Now as I was saying, this isn’t a game. You think I really want to run the boring day to day shit of a city, even a half destroyed one? I barely like doing it for the little town I run. No, better to leave that in the hands of someone with experience, someone like you. Of course this place will have to have new security now that all yours are dead, but I can provide that. Of course if you don’t want the job…” you say and then look at the woman. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright, alright, Kol. I’m not mad. Calm down. In fact, you calm down as well, you’re not getting sold anytime soon Layla.” You say addressing the both of them. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well, looks like I don't have much of a fucking choice. I imagine even if I killed you, some other fucking asshole would just take your place and probably wouldn't be as fucking understanding as you." Annie says. <EOS>
<BOS> “What so soon? We haven’t seen each other for awhile. Come, I’ll help you. What are you looking for exactly? “ Annah asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well…you’re here, you’re mine and you’re safe…as long as you stay in this room. But you get to be with me, isn’t that enough?” <EOS>
<BOS> "I am old, and tired, and cannot hope to change things. I would join you and face the next life, but Ivani would despise me." <EOS>
<BOS> “You’ve been working with me this long and you believed that? Hah, no wonder she got you.” <EOS>
<BOS> After some quick looting of bodies and few other tasks, you give Vera a few more instructions who seems to readily comply to anything you command. She’s just glad she survived your attack (Again it would seem). <EOS>
<BOS> Fortunately, not all the guards are power drunk assholes and one steps forward to pull the asshole one back a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, but I dunno. I’m not exactly multi-talented as you are and I doubt if I’d be able to try my hand at a life not involving crime somehow. Plus, here I’m probably the best thief in town. Elsewhere? I’m probably an amateur that would get eaten alive by the bigger criminals. Besides, I still got a good thing going here. I admit though it’s not going to be the same without your help.” <EOS>
<BOS> And you’re pretty sure that’s the cause of her distraction in-between your jobs. Something is on her mind and has been for a while now and today is the day she says as much. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re still a little groggy, Keira is very talkative and still very excited about all this. <EOS>
<BOS> “You keep bringing up your mother, I thought you were an orphan.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah and that’s about all that’s known about him, assuming it’s a guy. Have no real clue since whenever there have been sightings of the Inquisitor; the person is wearing a white mask along with a long white robe. Could be anything under there.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well your attempt to wipe out the Dornans of course.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck!” you utter out loud and then Tanya grabs your tunic so you don’t fall. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, and I was part of the Syndicate once too. Not for very long, but long enough to remember that you were killing them at one time. Some of those guys were my fucking friends! Okay, maybe not friends, but a couple owed me money which I’ll never fucking get back now!” a third says. <EOS>
<BOS> In any case you enter and see in the dim torchlight you see proper treasure that you could actually carry out of here. A lot of old necklaces, bracelets, crowns with gems and similar items behind glass, though some, like the weapons are mounted securely on the wall. <EOS>
<BOS> Madeline walks ahead of you first, but when you aren’t moving fast enough, she actually pulls your hand in an effort to get you to follow faster. <EOS>
<BOS> When you get so close to the place that you could actually touch the field if you wanted to, you notice that beyond the field there is a robed individual sitting on steps to the entrance and reading a book. <EOS>
<BOS> You and Heather proceed to the summoning room and when the door is opened there you see Gwen standing near a table with a few books and Vera in all her naked glory standing in a large circle with symbols in it. Never seen her like this before and it’s a bit of a surprise. <EOS>
<BOS> “Warts, you’re telling me you found a body in one of these barrels and you’re STILL drinking the fucking wine?” <EOS>
<BOS> Over the next few months, you start to really hate it as you start to feel the crunch of not having that extra surplus anymore. It’s not really much of a problem for you personally per say, but the rest of the League members aren’t exactly happy paying more dues as it were. <EOS>
<BOS> “What makes you say that? It isn’t like there are anymore religious factions in this city anymore.” You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Besides all that, you don’t exactly have any protection from the Holgard Watch so they aren’t likely to just look away in your case. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not on the bed you’re not!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure. You have your clean law abiding city and that will always be he case. No need to ever worry about the likes of us again.” You say sarcastically. <EOS>
<BOS> In your line of work you tend to bump into the same people and frequent the same places. So you started to get suspicious when women you had been intimate with started always winding up dead… <EOS>
<BOS> They are devoutly loyal. The mark compels them. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck, Annah. I told you I wasn’t an expert at doing this but feel free to help me if you know how!” You answer throwing the flint down. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m sorry I doubted you Tom. I obviously was way off about not believing that you weren’t one of the most important people in this organization.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well I accept.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s not a great start, however let me help you. For instance, if Mr. Dream and Weaver were these loudmouths that you claim they were, why the hell didn’t you report any of this sooner?” <EOS>
<BOS> As you watch the pair of them leave together, Vera speaks up. <EOS>
<BOS> "All of it. How fuck are we just going to walk away from all the money we're making and become regular blue collar bums? The working man is a sucker and this is just fucking stupid." Camid says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t tempt me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well she probably knows you aren’t going to kill her, meanwhile I was pointing a gun at her head.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You think you hear someone shout for a medic, but by then everything goes black. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes, yes, we have been monitoring that as well. But magic is the real problem. We can't lose magic. So, you see, we have no choice about this. Dreadfully sorry, again. You seem like a nice enough old chap." <EOS>
<BOS> Ludmilla’s people have been holding out pretty well all things considering. The orcs haven’t even breached the palace yet thankfully. If you hadn’t come along when you did though, they might have. <EOS>
<BOS> “I thought about it, but again, I don’t want too many ties to this place. I mean I’d keep Warts in charge of a chapter here, but I doubt that he’ll want the headache of running it. I figure I’ll just pass the businesses off to the next most qualified person who can start a new organization and we’ll take the half of the treasury and whoever wants to come with us to relocate.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, that’s okay. I’d rather you take a little extra time to make sure everything is secure. So is this room going to be where we hold the fighting games?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> "No," the serpent replied, "for I was invisible in your eyes. But I acquired the map, piece by piece." <EOS>
<BOS> One of the little boys, Tajon, who has come to hear most of your tales in the last few years, is sitting eagerly at the front. He frequently throws out adventurous, and sometimes silly, suggestions like pirates and princes and his recently offered but rejected, “frog.” You’ve asked him for a featured prompt a couple times in the past, and they were fun crowd pleasers followed by a decent, if nothing special, haul once the hat was passed for tips. <EOS>
<BOS> And that’s where our tale begins… <EOS>
<BOS> “Sorry Gert.” One says. <EOS>
<BOS> You ask around at the Inns, bars, and taverns. Several are interested in you coming to tell stories, and one even offers you free room and board if you will perform in their Inn, exclusively. That sounds far better than sleeping on the ground during your stay, so the deal is struck. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well when you’re already green and smell like the outdoors, I suppose it’s a lot easier to camouflage yourself with little effort. I’ll take my chances in a high tree.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You ride up top with the driver. I have some studying to do on the way and I don’t want you disturbing me. Besides, if you’re supposed to keeping an eye out for danger, you’ll do it better from there anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Feh, if it did all that well, why weren’t you rich?” Warts asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera has been overly concerned with your safety ever since she had Kol. You suppose you get why she is now due to you being the father of her child and all, but sometimes it’s a bit too much. <EOS>
<BOS> By the end of the day, you are trenbling and exhausted. As you return to your own bunk after a paltry supper, you mull over the only possible truth: they aren't passengers, they are cargo. You might be 'helping' them in the short run, but all you are really accomplishing is sprucing them up for buyers. <EOS>
<BOS> “You seem pretty confident in our new wizard allies. Just how friendly are you with this Heather? I mean are you fucking her or something?” <EOS>
<BOS> “You idiot, we were supposed to drag him someplace quiet and not draw a fucking crowd in front of us.” The second remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Then, time slows down. The corner of your vision fades in like a collapsing tunnel. Darkness overtakes, save for a single point of vision. Seth’s face melts away, the skin loosely falling from his face. His eyes turn into two running waterfalls down his exposed cheekbones. His teeth grind together, screeching, sending shivers down your neck. The pressure between his top and bottom teeth increases, sending chips of tooth flying in the air. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh this is temple business, but Elder Flynn didn’t send me. In fact he’s no longer in charge. I am.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re joking right? You’re in charge of a new nation that’s currently making waves in the underworld circles. You’re getting pretty infamous, however you also sent a letter to mom and dad years ago, so even if you hadn’t achieved all this, I still would have assumed you were at this location.” <EOS>
<BOS> Better you should stick to things that won’t directly fuck with the government too much directly and Vera already has experience in the whole slave market thing so you’re confident she’ll know how to run it properly. <EOS>
<BOS> If you haven’t checked already, you’ll find that I’ve emptied your savings and taken everything you stole from that house you robbed yesterday. I could have ripped you off that first night we spent together, since I found the hiding spot while you were sleeping, but then I wouldn’t have been able to use you one more time would I? <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ll think of something later, but anyway, now that I’ve filled you in on some of my journeys, it’s time for you to do likewise! Give me all the details because I trust that this will definitely be a very interesting story!” your sister says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I want to speak with Dusk privately anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> Then you see who can only be who you’re supposed to meet. A well dressed man with a thin mustache sitting all by himself and not looking very concerned about his surroundings. The fact that he’s here by himself speaks of his confidence that he’s either powerful enough to survive whatever you might have in store, or the consequences of him will be so severe that you won’t even try. He’s not drinking anything, but when he sees you he nods and waves you over. You tell your hobgoblin retinue to wait nearby and mentally prepare yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> You begin to tell Zalmora about your concerns with how things are done regarding robberies. There is little finesse, nobody sticks to a plan and it’s more outright thuggery. You go on to mention that it might not be as much of a problem if you weren’t in a city fanatical about curbing crime, but since you are, this is kind of a big problem in the long term. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr. Reynolds sits you up in your chair and draws attention away from any possible onlookers by sitting you up in your chair so your body just slouches on it without falling. He then makes some out loud comment about you being really tired today and to just rest your eyes a bit if you need to. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, maybe love isn’t the right word, but I have a hard time believing that you didn’t contact me in my dreams for shits and giggles. You’re actually fun in those dreams and I know you well enough in the real world that you never do anything remotely fun. It’s like you wanted me to see another side of you that nobody else does. Arguably the closest person you were close to before I showed up was Garrick, and you only see him as a father figure at best. You didn’t contact him in his dreams. You didn’t show up in anyone else’s either. You showed up in mine because you obviously have a fondness for…” <EOS>
<BOS> You see Nature’s Revenge up on stage performing some sort of minor magical act along with one of them playing music. Its very colorful and interesting, but right now you just want to find Annah and get the hell out of here. <EOS>
<BOS> “So, what’s the plan and what’s it all going to entail exactly?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I always knew you’d do well.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, there’s gotta be a line drawn somewhere. Otherwise this all falls apart. You know, like a support beam for the tunnels you’re building.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I did? Geez, sorry son…but this is different! (hic) Some…somebody…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ay, I gotz a lotta people here. Aren’t ya comin ta make a speech ‘bout a glorious future or sumthin?” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck it, if they wanna fight. Not gonna stop them. Anyway, go talk to Vera about the match details of who to pair them up against.” Actually you should get her to set them up with an elven opponent if possible. Should incite a little more bloodthirst.” <EOS>
<BOS> A few months pass and eventually Zamed returns with six more ships, Marco and his crew are about as ready as they’re going to be and your spies that have been sneaking in and out of Jicol, have made steps in opening the gates along with just creating as much havoc for ground forces as possible during the actual attack. <EOS>
<BOS> “So is that the bad news? That I’ll always have a vague sense of loss that won’t ever go away?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Well this sucks. Already you’re finding out that Hessla isn’t the place you imagined it was. It’s kind of why you took most of your important belongings with you just in case you decided to ditch the job and just stay in Hessla. <EOS>
<BOS> This has put a bit of a crimp in your own businesses a bit. Your own “habor” isn’t nearly big enough to accommodate all the visitors you might get. You’re trying to expand, but there is so much else to do. Not to mention slaver ships and pirates now have to sail all the way around the island to dock at Nightfall so they don’t get fired on now. It’s a pain in the ass for everyone involved. <EOS>
<BOS> “Cuz, more people around, more problems, dat’s why! I mean you should know dat better than anywun! Besides, I know too, Spider Fang tribe, full of idjits, why you think I stay to myself a lot?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I will make a decision in the morning. Dismissed,” King Aeric says, picking up the jug of ale. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re right, I have been hanging on to a memory and making excuses. Time put everything from the past aside and see what happens.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> Another day, another coin. <EOS>
<BOS> Whether she is or not though doesn’t matter, you’re still learning the facts today. <EOS>
<BOS> Madeline now starts to cry quietly. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t see why. Percy died on the way here when the ship was attacked by mermaids and he jumped overboard when hearing their deadly song.” <EOS>
<BOS> You're really at a loss of words. You look over at Vaughn who just shrugs and just says whoever you decide to marry, he'll attend the wedding in support. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s Sheriff Walford. Just one of your many admirers. You sit up from the floor and rub your head. <EOS>
<BOS> “However, you’re fortunate that today those consequences aren’t fatal.” <EOS>
<BOS> You chalk it up to perhaps some internal squabble and then when you return to your quarters that’s when you realize what’s happened. <EOS>
<BOS> Just as you’re about to leave, Flynt calls over to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course I’m still alive. Wait, have you still been worrying about that curse I told you was bullshit?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Ew Vaughn. You fucked a disgusting bum?" Zalmora remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, and I figured that’s what you’d suggest. Probably would be the best use of their skills I imagine. I suppose that would free up some of the folks who still aren’t exactly thrilled about their new assignment. They can come back to the city and the hobs can take their place. Now do I have to talk to these hobs about how I want things done or are you taking care of it?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Bah, Vera’s fine, she’s probably just really fuckin’ busy. I mean you know how it is. Look dis iz the ways I sees da situation…” <EOS>
<BOS> "And how do you know?" <EOS>
<BOS> Sure you feel pretty weird about the fact that you’re going to be sexing up what is your distant relative, but you remind yourself, that this is the only way. <EOS>
<BOS> You run, gasping, from the grove until you no longer feel anything competing for your mental focus. A log, covered with mushrooms and moss, lies across the forest floor. There is a worn flat space, relatively clean, at one end. You sit to think, and to write. You pull Ivani's book from your pack, briefly thumbing through the fading stories. You read a couple of your favorites to calm your nerves - one about a vegan hermit who discovers a rare, ancient wheel of cheese and must decide what to do with it, and another about a mermaid who falls in love with a winged man. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, I’m not sure what else I can do.” <EOS>
<BOS> Which is when you take the opportunity to grab Annah’s hand and run the hell out of there as fast as you can. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, REALLY friendly. Didn’t know it was going to be that kind of party. Guessing something was in the drinks. Glad I hadn’t drank anything while I was there. Still, I might have paired up with one of the horny aristocrat guys if it had just been a one on one thing, but then Ludmilla was around and she started hitting on me too and I got really creeped out. I mean she didn’t know of course, but she could potentially be my half sister, and that just really put me out of the mood entirely. I ran out as soon as I could.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. Didn’t know your parents lived here.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> Given how Garrick and Rook ended up, you have to believe that you’d do just as good of a job as they did, maybe even better. <EOS>
<BOS> “There, it’s done.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well if everyone here isn’t satisfied with how things are, why aren’t changes being made? I mean Tom even said he was going to start reorganizing the Crimson Talons.” <EOS>
<BOS> A few days pass and you finally step foot into Jicol proper. The Jicol navy has been either put out of action at the bottom of the sea or sailed away. Zamed and his own people have already begun pillaging the city. There is resistance still of course, but so far things are looking completely in your favor and apparently the Mayor of Jicol’s small fortress has already been breached. <EOS>
<BOS> In any case it’s almost like your bodies are in perfect sync with each other. Like it feels so natural and right that you’re achieving some sort of emotional and even spiritual fulfillment as well as a physical one. <EOS>
<BOS> “Called it.” Heather says. <EOS>
<BOS> "What the...Zal I think you've forgotten who is not only head of this organization, but who is also owner of this fucking inn!" <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t sure what the repercussions though might be. You take it for granted that assassination might always be a possibility, but you’re about as prepared for that as you’re going to be. You’re more of the mind that they may just start leaning on Vera directly. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya strokes your face with her hand and gives a faint smile. <EOS>
<BOS> "He was actually a miner, but he had a natural gift when it came to engineering. Which was good for the company since they just used his talents for creating very sound mine supports and they didn't have to pay for a real one. He probably could have been building new structures in Klyton, but he just didn't have the formal education." <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya doesn’t answer, she just looks at you like you’re going to tell him anyway, so why stop? <EOS>
<BOS> "Where the hell has Vaughn been? He hasn't come in for the past three days. Did he say he was sick or something?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s a good thing your hobs still weren’t feeling their best, might have been a more difficult fight. Looking for this?” Zamed says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Rook, we are hemorrhaging coin. We are not going to have enough to kick up to the Syndicate Directors this month. This state of anarchy is really bad for business and the deal you made with the Temple of Fel REALLY took a large chunk out of our treasury.” <EOS>
<BOS> “There’s that witch that runs that shop in Jicol.” <EOS>
<BOS> A few minutes later you arrive at your destination. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thank you, Captain… Wren,” Mira says as he leaves. <EOS>
<BOS> “When you break it, it will completely nullify all magic in the immediate area for a time. I’m fairly certain it should take down whatever the magic defenses that the Joachimite Inquisitor might have. You’ll still have to get in close and you’ve got one shot, but you’ve got a chance.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Pfft, nobody is going to care what we might be doing as long as we’re paying the coin to live wherever we’re choosing to live at and dressing the part” <EOS>
<BOS> “You took away my son and not only did you escape, but I see you merely plying your criminal ways here too. I could have easily told the Klyton militia about you, but no, I want to perform this justice myself. Not just for my son you murdered, but for ALL those you’ve hurt!” he shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> "So what're you getting at exactly?" <EOS>
<BOS> "You have been here a long time," you say, "I am sorry I did not come sooner, when I was young - " <EOS>
<BOS> Bloody Talons, pissed off ex, and some mysterious asshole looking for you, maybe its just time to leave Klyton completely. You really hate having to travel again though. Maybe you just need to find a better place to live. You’ll think more on this tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> You start to say something, but Mr. Reynolds stops you and also grabs your wrist tightly. So tight that it almost feels like he’s going to crush your bones. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait…you mean…Naji is…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Your funeral,” Kassi replies. “Just don’t lose before I can teach you another lesson.” <EOS>
<BOS> “He’s married to a Halfling, but my point is, Olaf isn’t going anywhere.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’ll just remain alert and keep an eye out this guy looking for you. Remain on your guard too, since you still don’t know if this man means you harm or not. Hopefully Virgil can tell you something later. You might have to offer a couple coppers, but it’s far cry from ten silvers. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? Already? The party’s just started and you want to leave?” <EOS>
<BOS> The next day you walk into Mr. Reynolds' office. <EOS>
<BOS> "Very impressive. You must be one special lady to have accomplished that feat." Your sister remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Now, we can probably convince some of these girls into slumming, but the problem is, they aren’t going to want to stick around. Especially if you’re trying practically pimp them out to some gross old inn owner. So this means that doesn’t really solve your issues. What you need is someone that’s going to come back and is willing to work for practically nothing. Would a band suffice, because I got one in mind and they’ll probably just perform for free drinks.” Annah says. <EOS>
<BOS> The current situation is bad, but not entirely unwinnable. You just have to make one major attack to turn the tide. Heather is in favor of helping what little remains of Ludmilla’s defenses at her palace. Heather says breaking up the attack going on there should destroy the rest of Peter’s forces or at least the majority of them. At that point he won’t have enough people to take the city, let alone hold it given that Ludmilla will still be alive at that point. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thank ME, that we got out when we did. I can only imagine the shit we would have been in had we still been in the house when they got back to it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “And summoning the dead isn’t?” Samuel retorts. “Very well. If this is the only way.” <EOS>
<BOS> Seth shakes his head. “Doubt it. It’d be too difficult to pass messages in and out of the castle. Even if they just used signals, someone would catch on. It’s a sizable castle, but everyone’s in the know.” <EOS>
<BOS> "How amusing!" The Empress finally speaks. "In some ways he was more foolish than clever, but his heart made up for it. And the idea of using Malong Field is wonderful!" She clicks a finger as the crowd finally bursts into applause. "Official Hancho, place a discussion regarding the use of Malong Field on the Agenda for next week. And give this man a suitable reward, say, 250 silver. He may sleep in a guest room and eat at the feast." <EOS>
<BOS> At first you were concerned that you might not be able to get back home. Now you’re concerned that maybe you shouldn’t go back home! <EOS>
<BOS> The first ferry ride starts at sunup, and you make sure to be on it. You try to enjoy the two hour boat ride, listening to the lapping water and the wheeling cries of the birds traveling between the edge of Redsand and Aselthorne. If it weren't for the irrational fear that someone was going to jump out at you from under a bench, it would be peaceful. <EOS>
<BOS> If you were a complete asshole you suppose you wouldn’t give a shit and just think with your dick anyway, but even if you just gave into your base desires, Vera’s useful enough that you’d hate to lose her help in the organization. Besides all that, you half wonder if Tanya is somehow keeping track of you. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm not so sure," she smiles. <EOS>
<BOS> "Would you graciously fetch me a bit of cloud fluff? I need it to make medicine." <EOS>
<BOS> “I still think this is a really bad idea…” <EOS>
<BOS> This is a unique form of security, but you’re no weak willed fool. You begin to try to disbelieve your surroundings and try to move. <EOS>
<BOS> When you once again put enough distance between you and Teckleville again, you slowly start exiting the wooded areas (which are starting to thin anyway) and start following the road directly. <EOS>
<BOS> After vomiting a little bit you eventually stand back up and stagger back to the Hell’s Own Inn. Thankfully you aren’t accosted by anyone along the way. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re left alone in the dark, save for the small light above you. Now that things have settled a bit, you finally have time to think about the events that just happened. How could an entire army show up almost out of thin air? Kassi said King Aeric was supposed to protect the monastery. Why didn’t his army show up? Then it hits you. Everyone you know is dead. Kassi, Brother Samuel, even Garth is gone. You are alone. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re also at a disadvantage of not knowing the language or even your general location let alone how things work around here. The best you have to go on is a few old stories your sister told you and that’s going to have to be enough for now <EOS>
<BOS> Such things are typically just heard about in myths and stories, but given the magical world you live in, who is to say they don’t exist somewhere? <EOS>
<BOS> “I admit I spoke too harshly. I’m sorry. I know you’d probably kill enough of them giving me a chance to run before they cut you down.” <EOS>
<BOS> While Sneaks’ advice is well meaning, it wasn’t exactly Tanya’s ass that was clouding your mind, but rather her face. Fortunately Sneaks is also correct in that the effect does seem to dissipate. <EOS>
<BOS> The door to the slave market then opens up and you just narrowly avoid getting blasted with a musket. You fall to the floor and manage to put another attacker down with your pistol, but it’s apparent that someone from last night’s meeting tipped off Elias because his people were waiting for you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit. That’s the first time I’ve actually seen Kol do any shadow magic stuff. So should I be concerned?” <EOS>
<BOS> “We still got a ways ta go. The damn bandits are all over dis forest and I’m trying to keep us away from their camps. So we gotta go the long way less you fancy a fight.” Warts responds. <EOS>
<BOS> “What about Warts? He tends to not have much to do.” <EOS>
<BOS> Trusting Zal's judgement on this and lacking any other ideas, you end up agreeing to this set up, at which point Zalmora says great and starts dragging you to a church while busily explaining what story you should come up with when you buy the property. <EOS>
<BOS> You wake up midday. After getting yourself ready for today’s endeavors, you knock on Virgil’s door, but there is no answer. He’s either still asleep or he’s out collecting donations for Joachim. Probably the latter considering you didn’t contribute to his booze fund. <EOS>
<BOS> Warts approaches cautiously and then takes one of the rings from your hand. He inspects it and then speaks. <EOS>
<BOS> However, you’re conscious enough to realize it isn’t any sort of creature at all, but instead a swing trap that you triggered while running and not paying attention. <EOS>
<BOS> The pair of you travels there without any problems. It seems the rioting and civil unrest has died down for the rest of the night. The owner of The Lighthouse seems pretty surprised (and happy) that anyone is checking in since the place is practically empty. <EOS>
<BOS> “You got a way with words Zal. Well okay, I suppose this stuff isn’t really top secret or anything.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh for…you saw her face and looked straight into her eyes didn’t you? Fuck. Well that explains why she came back all pissed off and not very talkative yesterday. Though she’s surly at the best of times. It’s a temporary effect kid, try to just focus on the job okay?” <EOS>
<BOS> In fact when the Felians actually come to you for assistance on wiping out the Dornans, you legitimately have an excuse that you can’t spare the people and it’s not cost effective to do so. As expected Gloom is not very happy with you not helping, though you point out that you’re not happy that he just suddenly sprung this on you and attempt to deflect the blame by claiming he was keeping secrets from you about his private war with the Dornans. <EOS>
<BOS> "Okay, Rob was the better choice in terms of costs. My guy would have still been better though." Zalmora remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> "If you keep resisting, I'm not going to make a clean cut and it's going to take more than one blow to take your head off." The officer says as he prepares his axe. <EOS>
<BOS> The golden brooch is the most exquisite of the items, so you purchase it for the Empress. You hope the size of it will not count against you, but are glad you could find something suitable within your meager budget. <EOS>
<BOS> Following instructions, you do just that, though at this point Vera is definitely beginning to not feel well and suddenly coughs up blood. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, how would you like my help AND get rid of your curse?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Meh, don’t worry about it. I’ll muddle through like I always do.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I’ll talk to him, though I really think it would be better if we both went.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Didn’t know female ogres were so sensitive.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” he replies. <EOS>
<BOS> "What?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> But what happens now if you return to the future? Even if the mages at Arcanius can help you, you certainly can’t return to your time now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Put the ship in danger?” <EOS>
<BOS> Richard chimes in. “This is the first I’ve seen Imperial troops wander off the main roads. Venturing off into unknown territory is usually something they avoid.” <EOS>
<BOS> The captain steps forward, looking you over. "He's a bit old, Spryce, not quite a quality specimen. Very old, in fact." <EOS>
<BOS> “The Syndicate should have done this years ago.” Teklis says. <EOS>
<BOS> You actually wander down there for a while since it isn’t like you’re an expert in navigating your way around in the sewers. You run into a few bums, some really destitute Blue Dream junkies, and some oversized fauna, but nobody of any major importance. <EOS>
<BOS> “FUCK YOU! It was ALL your fault! How could I have a chance with her when YOU corrupted her! Tell me…did she smell like flowers when you embraced her? Did she taste like honey when you kissed her? Did the very heavens move when you plunged into her?” he asks with a mixture of anger and resentment, but also with a glint of eagerness that you’ll tell him. <EOS>
<BOS> “David? Um…he’s dead.” <EOS>
<BOS> With a couple quick moves you pull out your dagger, stab him in his arm and relieve him of his fancy pistol. Graham screams out like a little girl and now pleads for his miserable life. <EOS>
<BOS> Now you think of Tanya. <EOS>
<BOS> "We will have to re-hide it," Barus agreed. <EOS>
<BOS> “For fuck’s sake stop talking so much and just COMMAND it to lift the fucking curse! The more you talk, the more it’s going to beguile you into doing something stupid, like stepping into the circle with it!” Heather yells. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you finish which is followed by some uncomfortable silence. Rook looks over at Bolt who shrugs, then over to Lloyd who is quite vocal. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, but it’s the only way I know to Holgard.” You say <EOS>
<BOS> “We did?” <EOS>
<BOS> Fel might be uncover all secrets, but he can’t find you if you keep one step ahead by piling on more bullshit to hide under. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wha – what?” She asks, startled, her shoulders tensing. There is a light murmur of disappointment from those in the crowd not chosen. <EOS>
<BOS> “Mm, too risky. Besides, that would just be foreplay not murder.” <EOS>
<BOS> And with those last words, Zalmora takes her leave of you presumably to go gather a few more items before heading out to seek Jake. <EOS>
<BOS> “THIS IS NO ILLUSION. WHAT YOU SEE IS VERY REAL. JUST LIKE YOUR PAIN. YOU WANTED A GREAT TREASURE OF OLD GALPATIS. THERE IS NO GREATER TREASURE THAN LIVING DURING THE APEX OF ITS GLORY. TIS MORE THAN A SCOUNDREL LIKE YOU DESERVES!” <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t even wait, you just shoot him. This causes the rest to run a bit or take cover, but they don’t go far. You quickly go to the sick fuck’s body and cut off his head with your short sword and shove it in your bag of heads. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright, alright, but can ya at least gimme my pack back?!” <EOS>
<BOS> As the horde continues to pour onto the roof, your visibility of the other wizard and Heather is starting to be blocked by said horde. You desperately shoot at the horde, but unlike your previous experience back at the League headquarters, you’re not going to intimidate them by killing a few. There’s nowhere to go either. The closest building isn’t close enough that you could easily jump to it, even if it was still intact. <EOS>
<BOS> “I mean, you don’t look quite like any greenskin I’ve ever seen.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah and that’s bullshit. The Thieves’ Guild was supposed to be a so called alliance of independent rogues as well and they definitely had a leader. Someone always has to be calling the shots at the top of the pyramid. The fact that we haven’t found this person yet indicates to me that they got much more in mind than simple defense. My other concern is the Jicol Watch. While this temple will keep us from getting completely fucked over if they ever come down hard on us, it still doesn’t change that all of our businesses could still be fucked in the city.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Is that so? Well how about you tell me and I’ll go relay it to him and he can decide. Rook is much too busy to be dealing with the likes of you.” <EOS>
<BOS> You approach the entrance and then you hear footstep behind you. <EOS>
<BOS> While this would be great any other time, you’re still concerned about you situation. <EOS>
<BOS> The woman’s eyes widen when you say that. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re pondering that possibility, Graham begins speaking again. <EOS>
<BOS> “I...uh. I don’t know what happened,” you say, looking down. <EOS>
<BOS> You get inside and immediately head to the location of the safe since you want to be in and out of here as soon as possible. Pushing the bed slightly, you uncover the safe and get to work. <EOS>
<BOS> Hell, you would have been dead without her when you dealt with that bushwacking shadow magic using asshole Bolt as well. <EOS>
<BOS> “What do you mean?” <EOS>
<BOS> Finished with talking, you open fire and nearly instantly you feel like everything is slowing down in front of you. You see your first bullet actually hanging in the air and then Percy moving to the left. What torchlight there was in the room, goes out completely. <EOS>
<BOS> “Duly noted. Well if you’re done with your warnings, I have things to do.” <EOS>
<BOS> Just as you’re about to shut the door a voice calls out. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fine. If you want to help, I’m not going to stop you, but stay out of our way.” <EOS>
<BOS> With the immediate threat gone, the battered palace doors are finally opened up and you’re all urged to enter since the baroness wishes to speak with you all <EOS>
<BOS> “Well you heard the lady.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I can honestly say you are doing a fine job, and best of all, it isn’t costing me a lot. I gotta talk to you about something though.” <EOS>
<BOS> “But, my issue is you placing so much fucking trust in Warts. I thought you were smarter than that. Mark my words, that little halfbreed is going to get drunk with power and try to betray you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, I haven’t forgotten about him, but running through this little rat maze he’s created isn’t in my game plan. The JRC at this point is dead and he’s not going to resurrect it in any capacity. Even if he tries, the Jicol Watch is so fed up with all of us, they’ll crack down hard on them and we won’t have to do shit. No, Sneaks is going to either try to escape off the island OR possibly try to assassinate me eventually. If it’s the first one, I have a better idea of how to prevent that. If it’s the second, he better hope he gets it right.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m also getting you proper pain killers for cheap and you don’t have to roll the dice getting whatever the shit the apothecary thinks is going to work on any given day.” <EOS>
<BOS> You catch the lockpick that Tanya tosses at you and run back to the torture chamber. You go back to Yinen’s cell and start opening the cell, but he just continues to do the usual rocking back and forth and mumbling. <EOS>
<BOS> “Keep talking to me like that you little shit, and I’ll just run all of your assess in. I still remember you and your gang of hooligans breaking several windows and punching old people in the face a couple years ago!” one of the guards says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay. Glad you guys didn’t wait until I was done taking a shit then since this seems to have worked out. Hmm, this one’s pretty, almost familiar looking.” Flameflower says giving you a look before being distracted by screams of the girl being pulled out of the carriage by some of the other bandits. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah? Well most of the fucking slaves just got killed thanks to you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I already took that into consideration. (Sigh) I suppose I’m going, though the letter also says I should bring one more person with me since that’s apparently the rule of this event.” <EOS>
<BOS> The description already sounds like Percy. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I trust the correct amount is in those chests. I mean I’m sure it is, but I think you know the issues that would occur if that wasn’t the case.” <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t surrender. Not now. You were meant to be free and if you can’t be free then it’s no life at all. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr. Dream is too late to draw his own flintlock as you plant a bullet in his head and Dreamweaver fairs no better. You’ve killed the pair of them and predictably the shots draw the attention of some of the others. <EOS>
<BOS> Before you can say anything else, a small ugly green child wanders in behind Warts. You don’t know how old it is, but it can’t be older than a toddler. <EOS>
<BOS> You get the impression that if you stayed here, you could probably carve out a future for yourself. You think with time and effort you could rise to be greater than your current status in the criminal world. Hell, you probably could get your own organization started. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I’d pick the lock, but it’s not like I have a lockpick anymore, do you have any?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Whatever you have planned, I’m not playing your game.” <EOS>
<BOS> Several other bolts follow though fortunately the ECS has not employed skilled marksmen. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh, what a fun game!" For a half hour, the amused squirrels scratched at the dirt, until at last a golden box came into view. "Oh, my!" the squirrels said, "there is something here! We thought you were playing." <EOS>
<BOS> “And I said I’m not a fucking whore and I’m not going to pretend to be one either! Besides, they weren’t buying that story anyway. My way worked!” Annah replies. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr. Scars looks at you as if to detect whether you’re lying or not. <EOS>
<BOS> “The fuck did you say?” he asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I wasn’t sure! Like your wife, I thought maybe it was just my eyes playing tricks on me or I was overly tired. However a couple days ago something happened that couldn’t possibly be the case. I saw Kol making shadows on the wall with his hands. At first it just seemed to be him trying to figure out what was going on and not realizing it was the candlelight causing it, but then the shadows began acting independent of what his hands were doing. Soon they became little figures which he watched and was amused by, and then they disappeared altogether. I would have told you sooner, but…I dunno I was sort of shook up myself about it and I couldn’t figure out how to approach it and I kept going over…” <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sigh) Back in the shit. Well at least I’m a little richer this time. Okay, I think he said this way…” <EOS>
<BOS> You explain to Tom about a potential split with Jake altogether and just letting him go his own way since he seems happier anyway. Tom isn’t too fond of the idea since it no longer means gaining a cut of Jake’s looting profits, but he’s not outright dismissing it. In fact out of all the options, Tom still seems to think the best plan is to do nothing. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m just sayin’ you could be doin’ better if you went fer better targets. Have you even broken into one of dem nobles’ homes yet?” <EOS>
<BOS> “However, there IS something.” Ahmed adds. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thank you,” you reply, but she has already moved on, melting into the morning crowd of shoppers. You open the purse into the hat and count the total: thirty silver! She must have put in twenty-five. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, an watch where you point dat thing! I had enough of that already.” Warts exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> As usual Annah’s overreacting and you just need to calm her down. <EOS>
<BOS> The trek outside of town and up the low hill to the Empress's fortress is quite long. You feel half-dead by the time you reach the gates, and sip some water from your canteen to refresh as the guards interrogate you and inspect your gift. <EOS>
<BOS> “You nervous?” Peter asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “If Heather doesn’t win, then we’re going to need something to stop your ex, I’m looking for some sort of spell. Just focus on unbarricading the door. Hopefully the other students are working on the other side to get in here.” Gwen says as she hastily goes through book pages. <EOS>
<BOS> You've got more than enough saved and have enough connections that you could easily open up a real business front. You'd just need to keep everything low key and change a few things. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya, it’s me! You gotta snap out of this! These people are trying to control you!” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> You soon join the fight and find that there are indeed a lot of Joachimites that seem to be coming out nowhere. They are screaming their deity’s name and how they’re going to purge all unbelievers, still they seem a little take off guard when you arrive. <EOS>
<BOS> "Hey look, that's not my fucking problem! The best I can do is if any of you want jobs as waitresses, I can accommodate in that respect, but you if you want to go whore, you do it on your own time and away from this place!" <EOS>
<BOS> Before Garrick can complete his statement, you finally enter the room causing an immediate hostile look from Garrick and a look of exasperation from Tanya. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera takes a drink of the rum she’s brought with her from Jicol before continuing. <EOS>
<BOS> The ultimate results of that skirmish is eventual defeat of the Dornans, though with a very high cost to the Felians. The Felians wind up having less numbers than the Dornans had when the faction war was restarted. Little more than a handful and Gloom isn’t counted among them any longer. <EOS>
<BOS> You take his head and start smashing it as hard as you can on the stone floor. Reginald tries to feebly stop you, but he’s too weak at this point and with the back of his skull being caved in and his brains starting to leak out of his head he soon loses consciousness forever. <EOS>
<BOS> “We can’t just leave. The others need us,” Kassi replies. <EOS>
<BOS> “You sure?” <EOS>
<BOS> Because that’s exactly what you do to him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey we’ve got whores too.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Heh. You barely have any stubble on your face! I knew you were just a kid! Something about you though…you look strangely familiar.” The man remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Really?” <EOS>
<BOS> Annah at this point shoves the drink in your hand and takes your pack out of your other hand. She opens it up and smiles. <EOS>
<BOS> “…that’s it? I thought you were going to ask for something unreasonable. Wait, are we trying to rob a bank or city hall or something?” <EOS>
<BOS> They’re more than happy to finish the job of putting you out of your misery. <EOS>
<BOS> Without much else to do and this being a bit of an exhausting event, you go to sleep. When you wake up its midday and feeling refreshed. <EOS>
<BOS> When he woke, Sandman was gone. The Court of the Muses was ash, and the other soldiers huddled together. <EOS>
<BOS> “I will do what I must to end the lineage. I hoped the rumors weren’t true,” Seth answers with the swing of his swords. <EOS>
<BOS> Sneaks says that it’ll still be awhile before you’re allowed to actually go to the Guild proper, he says that as long as you keep up the good work, you’ll eventually get to see it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fucking hell, that’s pretty fucking cold. I mean shit, I just don’t have that in me I don’t think.” <EOS>
<BOS> “That wasn’t what I was talking about.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Acolyte. Stay!” Brother Trevor commands. “The rest of you are on meal prep.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Guess I need to have a meeting with whoever is the head of the Temple of Fel. Do we have any actual information on that?” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t know. I must.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Better than I hoped. Worse than I feared. So has the Syndicate been to see you?” <EOS>
<BOS> Honestly, I’m a little surprised that you fell so easily to my charms as well as my lies. I mean there never was a Jenny. That was just some woman’s house I broke into recently and could never get the safe open. <EOS>
<BOS> The priest is accommodating, taking you through what seems like a hundred different rooms before you both decide some dinner is in order. The guest rooms are opulent, the dungeons duly frightening (is that real dried blood on the torture equipment, or is it all for show?,) and the throne room magnificent: the throne itself is made of what seems like glass, but glows inwardly with fiery colors, like an opal or mother-of-pearl. There is even a ballroom with ten chandeliers, a cylindrical potion room at the base of one tower that Kemris lets you poke around in - you spend some time picking up jars of unguents and nail clippings to examine - and a small indoor lake. <EOS>
<BOS> But how best to go about this? He first started with their food, deciding that oats were too plain. He built an apple corer and masher, making apple sauce to mix with the oats. The horses enjoyed this a great deal. But it was messy, and the horses were not as fond of the baths they all had to take to clean up. <EOS>
<BOS> “Gwen, you will NOT harm Tanya. If you continue to attack, I’ll kill you myself.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> A dark figure that you can barely make out sits in the corner of the room. <EOS>
<BOS> The man took down the Thieves Guild and drove out the Ebony Claw Syndicate. <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad to hear it. And because I can already see it running through your mind, no I am NOT going to eat the bodies. I’m going to harvest some of the organs for potion ingredients.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you the one to stop him? The King is powerful, and the hammer at his side is deadly.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you get back, Bruno sees you and gives you a sideways glance at first. <EOS>
<BOS> Two hours later, you stand on the short of Aselthorne a free man, even if still disguised as a woman. You walk around for a bit to stretch your legs, find some new and warmer clothes at a thrift shop and stuff them in your pack, then find the Fat Cat and spend a few coins on breakfast and ale. <EOS>
<BOS> “Your stuff and you snuck it in here? Are you crazy?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Nah. Ludmilla will probably just tell me to send a few assassins to take them out. Training of the Silent Ones has been going well and they should be ready for outside jobs. No shadow magic tricks, but they don’t need tricks when they got pure skill. In any case I imagine goodwill between Holgard and the Spiderfang tribe will be continued.” <EOS>
<BOS> You and Zal proceed celebrate your victory and new lives as productive law abiding citizens in a physical way. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t get another chance to get up before Jake takes advantage of your position by jumping on your back and wraping his arms around your neck. <EOS>
<BOS> You remain until evening, when you can see her glittering band of green join Sandman's blue in the sky. Then you leave, home to the small house in Dreaming Forest, where everything reminds you of her. <EOS>
<BOS> You sit Kol on the table and being your tale, while the old witch begins studying him. As you’re telling your tale, the witch does some sort of motion with her hands which briefly causes her to turn invisible. She then smiles and tells Kol to make the same hand gesture. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m sure there are a couple of other staff actually around, but probably locked up in their labs either performing experiments or reading. That’s how it usually is for us nowadays though. Seems like we’re all just studying magic rather than actually using it for any real purpose.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well they’ve been sort of busy with other things, like their recent war with Nichan for example. While the ruling class over there doesn’t want to spend their resources and treasury to take this place back, they certainly won’t turn down someone else willing to do the job, and that’s where Peter comes in. He’s of noble birth, loyal to the kingdom and would be an excellent governor for this city and absorb it back into Delantium’s fold.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Our current strengths are basically smashing people in their face and taking their shit. I thought we established that isn’t exactly good in the long term.” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re silent. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit!” you shout just barely rolling out of the way of the large branch wielded by the orc who also fell off the bridge. You don’t know where he came from and you didn’t even hear him, but none of that matters right now. What matters is how you’re going to survive his assault. <EOS>
<BOS> Well this isn’t good. <EOS>
<BOS> "And if you are a little foolhardy, but want to see some amazing things along the way, you could take a horse through the Pass of Night northeast. It will weave through the mountains until you reach the Cathedral of Havor. You'll need a guide, and it's a difficult ride, but the Cathedral is one of those places everyone should visit once in a lifetime. A bit dark for some, since they serve the blood gods, but great inspiration for a storyteller, right?" <EOS>
<BOS> You soon arrive at a run down house in a lower class district. The house itself looks like it suffered through the recent conflicts in the city. Wouldn’t be the only property in this city to do so. <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, I had some green guys of my own. A little on smaller side though. Hm, starting to feel a lot better. At least not aching in pain anymore. Guess I did need that after all. Thanks.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, is that Heather? I remember seeing her a couple times and she didn’t look like that! What the fuck happened to her?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not so sure about that. I wasn’t ever directly attacking a single Nichan city or facing the full might of their fleet. I just harassed and plundered their isolated ships, not to mention I planned out ambushes. Attacking Jicol is greater risk and you know it is, otherwise you wouldn’t even be asking for help from the likes of me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course, let’s go back to your place.” Annah replies. <EOS>
<BOS> "No, maybe not a complete one, but I'm sure not that smart, otherwise I wouldn't be in this situation...(Sigh) I mean if you were asking me to build simple tunnels and rooms and making sure they don't collapse, then yeah I guess I could do that, but I don't know about building an underground city." <EOS>
<BOS> “So who you marryin?” <EOS>
<BOS> The remainder of the night is pretty quiet in fact. You’re still half paranoid about someone sneaking up on you both, but you never even hear anything out of the ordinary. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, you’ve got enough to manage and until you see signs of treachery on Warts’ part, you’ll continue to let him handle the outside operations. You’re fairly confident you’ll be savvy enough to realize if something is going wrong and even if you don’t catch it, Vera’s suspicious enough of Warts that she’ll probably tell you. <EOS>
<BOS> One thing you’ve learned since acquiring your new weapon is how easy it kills folks with minimal effort on your part. <EOS>
<BOS> You look around and notice that at least one of Gloom’s people is here. There might be more, but if they are, they must be better at hiding themselves. In any case, you’re satisfied that you have an advantage if it comes to a fight. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh…I wouldn’t bet on all that. I may have eventually come here anyway…I mean I was wondering what I was going to do after graduation…hey did you know besides slowly embracing my heritage, they wanted me to help oversee the building of a new pain tower? I’m getting to use what I learned!” Madeline beams. <EOS>
<BOS> “Would it really matter to you if I was?” <EOS>
<BOS> You stumble out of the room and find that several servants are cleaning up everywhere along with several disheveled noble types walking around half dressed and hung over. Nobody pays much attention to you and just goes about their own business as you make your way to exit the palace. <EOS>
<BOS> “No. They all saw you kill Klint. I mean I did get asked questions, but I just said you and Klint got into a fight and you accidently killed him in the process. They didn’t seem convinced that you killed him by accident though, so yeah they’re still pissed at you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s a nice thought. I see you really thought this out while sitting on your chair playing cards and drinking your ale. Here’s another thought though. While we’re sitting here playing cards, telling jokes and jerking each other off, all of our business interests are getting fucked up. All our Purple Wish dens? Destroyed. That’s a shitload of our income right there and it can’t be easily made up. Our whores? Slaughtered. Again can’t easily be made up, unless you lot are gonna start selling your asses to make up the loss and I guarantee it wouldn’t. Our protection rackets? Well you can’t extort corpses, and that’s what A LOT of them are right now thanks to orcs just killing everything in sight. I mean fuck, we ARE supposed to be protecting these hapless suckers if not out of the goodness of our hearts then at least for our own pockets! Shit, that’s the whole damn point!” <EOS>
<BOS> “And orcs tend to be brutish thugs that speak in short sentences, but there are exceptions as you can see.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, anywhere. Hessla for starters? The point is I want you to come with me. I mean…I just don’t see it as a bad idea given how we obviously feel towards each other.” <EOS>
<BOS> ut if you’re going to start fucking whores, you could still do better than Randi. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes. I was sitting there watching Kol playing on the floor with some blocks and stacking them. Then I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me because it looked like he was interacting with the shadows cast by the blocks due to the candle light. Then I realized that’s exactly what he was doing.” Vera remarks and she holds on to Kol who looks fairly unfazed by any of what you’re discussing. He just smiles at you. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera at this point looks down a bit and rubs her eyes. <EOS>
<BOS> So much for good deeds. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re kidding. We work together, while I don’t pretend that we know everything about each other, we’re not exactly strangers.” <EOS>
<BOS> Now you’re totally confused. Annah smiles and explains before you can ask the obvious. <EOS>
<BOS> “Jenny’s not even here yet either. You’ve got time.” Annah says and stops what she’s doing, goes over to the bad and grabs your cock. <EOS>
<BOS> The demon’s voice projected from behind the veil. It’s the mix between a low growl and raspy, labored breath. Each word is articulated to perfection, slow and deliberate. Ekk’a fired another arrow at the demon. To his disbelief, the arrow flies harmlessly through the figure and bounces from the opposite castle wall. <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, by that time, it’ll be a diluted mixture filled with so much other stuff that it’s not worth even considering. Besides, it’s really no worse than what I put into some of my potions. If some of these customers knew what I used in my sexual prowess potions, I guarantee they’d probably rather go lacking in that area.” <EOS>
<BOS> You inform the rest of the League of your plan and assign your most skilled to start finding ways (or making ways) of sneaking into the city now. You tell them not to engage anyone and to keep a low profile while they’re scouting the security and such. You then tell them you want a report on everything within the next few days. <EOS>
<BOS> Well this is a bizarre outcome. You almost can’t believe it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Help me with the laundry first and then ask me,” she replies. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? We can pay your price. I mean as you said we’re doing a lot better now.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Richard notices your strange advance, and holds a hand out. “Whoh, now. Are you ok?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Pissed? Nah. I mean I sort of had a feelin’ sumthin’ like dis wuz comin. Shit in Holgard never stays stable fer long. Best ta get out now if dere’s gonna be an invasion.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno. Maybe. Something still needs to be brought up to Tom though.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Heather leads you into the temple which almost resembles more of a library than a place of worship. Several other Dornans see Heather and you and disapproval already ensues. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh trust me, when they caught you tryin’ to rape that girl, they wanted to, but I specifically told them to bring you in alive no matter what the circumstances. Because I personally want to see you hang.” <EOS>
<BOS> Grayhaze exhales a bit, scratches her brow before answering. <EOS>
<BOS> “You heard me. I want you to go fuck a bunch of whores. Pick a brothel we own and fuck as many as you can. I mean I know you didn’t do it before because you didn’t want to put their lives in jeopardy and that’s very sweet of you. One of your endearing qualities, but we need to see if any of this is true once and for all. Obviously if they start dying off then maybe this curse business has some merit and if it IS you doing it, then it’s going to be really obvious soon enough. I mean maybe you’ll get some of them, but no way in hell you’re going to be able to kill them all without getting caught.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I think we got all of them that were here. I can’t find Sneaks though. He’s nowhere to be found.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey handsome, you get lucky yet?” Annah remarks holding a drink in her other hand. <EOS>
<BOS> “Apologies Flame. Um, what should we do with this one?” Haylon says pointing to the young man who they’re holding up since he’s barely conscious. <EOS>
<BOS> By the time you make it to the top floor, you’ve got a horde chasing you. You scramble up the ladder to the roof and fling open the hatch. There upon the roof, you see Heather and her antagonist throwing bolts of magic and blocking each other’s attacks. It would seem they’re evenly matched and neither one is paying any attention to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t think she looks at me with anything but scorn.” You say in an effort to deflect. <EOS>
<BOS> "Your Imperial Majesty, I hate to interrupt," one of the advisors say, "but there are still petitioners, and a half-hour before Open audience closes." <EOS>
<BOS> At this point you’re shoved again, this time hard enough to move you back a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s certainly the closest city and it’s the direction you ran from Teckleville anyway. The problem is if anyone from Teckleville is still searching for you, that’s going to be the first place they look. <EOS>
<BOS> You fend off his attack in an effort not to hurt him too badly, but he isn’t so much interested in fighting as he is escaping. He runs off yelling after he manages to maneuver around you. You hear Tanya shout something in the next room and you run back to her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Damnit.” You say seeing a familiar woman on the floor with an axe wound in her head. <EOS>
<BOS> “You think you know everything don’t you? Well let me tell you something, you don’t know shit. YOU are still a BOY and YOU are not worthy of Tanya.” Garrick says getting in your face. <EOS>
<BOS> “A cure? Of course I’ll help! What is it that you need? I’ll do it! It’s the least I can do after what I put you through.” <EOS>
<BOS> It doesn’t take long before you, Vaughn and a few others confront Tom in his office. He’s pretty surprised. <EOS>
<BOS> “You sure we’re going to be enough? Should we bring some more guys? There are a lot more goblins than us.” Zal asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “If you have ideas, why not bring them to Tom’s attention?” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, sir.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes! By the gods, I can’t believe you fucking forgot! In fact it was YOUR idea to go way the hell out here, I just wanted to do it over behind Derrick’s barn where I first gave you a blowjob.” <EOS>
<BOS> At this point the Inquisitor’s parents run over and kneel by him. Both are sobbing and his mother lifts his head a bit and removes the white mask he was wearing. <EOS>
<BOS> You enter the place and find yourself in a large oval room with several long wooden support beams stretching from the floor to the ceiling. The ceiling is actually a lot higher than you expected. If there were seats and stairs encircling the room, it actually might resemble the Klyton coliseum on a smaller scale. <EOS>
<BOS> You look over at the old couple and guess the Inquisitor means them. You suppose you know why he came running back in here now. What you don’t get is that he seems to know you and not just by reputation. <EOS>
<BOS> “YOU! Get out of here, we’re having a private conversation!” Garrick yells. <EOS>
<BOS> After a quick perusal of the outside surroundings, you’re guessing the Jenny has already left so you quickly get to work on picking the lock, which is easy for you of course. <EOS>
<BOS> “So, you’re really not here to force me to join you? This isn’t a trick?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey! I wanna tell your superior something!” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah? Well I still say ya betta hurry up. A lot ain’t dat patient.” <EOS>
<BOS> But this is a problem for another time; right now you’ve got a cult priest to assassinate. <EOS>
<BOS> “I saw an opening and I took it,” you reply. “You leave yourself open during your attacks—” <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck you cunt face!” Trobart shouts and stomps off. You just shake your head at the old man’s misplaced anger. <EOS>
<BOS> Now you’re just confused. <EOS>
<BOS> "I was too late," the man said sadly, looking down towards the fire, "too late to save them. But perhaps not too late to stop this war." <EOS>
<BOS> “Gwen, stop groveling and take your boyfriend to go practice your healing magic for a change.” <EOS>
<BOS> Well at least reputation has its benefits and now you’re just irritated that you even spent any amount of energy feeling guilty about having sex with that thieving bitch. <EOS>
<BOS> Finally when you’re outside, Heather speaks. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’ve never seen the kid in action,” Seth replies. “I’m telling you, we can manage this.” <EOS>
<BOS> You continue your fight with the Joachimites and fortunately get a little relief from the government since Ludmilla finally calls a halt to ongoing hostilities towards the League since the Joachimites are a greater threat. However your activities are severely limited to just running brothels and gambling. Other activities such as extortion or dealing drugs are to no longer be tolerated. You don’t have much choice in the matter since much like the government; you can’t fight a war on two fronts and are just managing to keep the League from collapsing internally. <EOS>
<BOS> Reginald walks towards you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Watch out!” Vera barely manages to utter before you blast the asshole that’s currently kicking you. <EOS>
<BOS> After sizing you up a bit, Rook speaks again. <EOS>
<BOS> This is getting a little strange, but you might as well ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Large mobs of villagers wander aimlessly among the ash, making no effort to put any of the remaining fires it out. In fact, their behavior is quite odd given the situation. And you even see one particular villager with his back on fire – yet he seems to pay it no heed! <EOS>
<BOS> An old man, far older than you, sits atop a rock and grins toothily. You recall him saying that he came here to study the ways of nature and the unity of the world - a hermit if there ever was one. Perhaps he would suggest something symbolic that you could weave into a fable or moral tale. <EOS>
<BOS> Without thinking you look at the waters below and see a couple of splashes and a glimpse of a large fishtail. <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile, you’ve managed to recover a bit, and once again you can take the opportunity to run while the orc’s attention is divided. <EOS>
<BOS> "Bless her for it!" <EOS>
<BOS> Apparently the Klyton militia wasn't as thorough as they claimed in the papers all those years ago. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re surprisingly resigned and calm about all this.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Step through the portal. We must protect our home,” the Grandmaster directs. “Lucky for us, King Aeric’s emissary is here to help.” <EOS>
<BOS> You haven’t felt nearly this bad since you left Annah back in Teckleville. Still, you feel this is for the best and hopefully Madeline can indeed “get over it” like she claims. <EOS>
<BOS> Tom heads over to one of his safes and after unlocking it, he takes out two green pieces of an oval shaped object, which he then puts together and hands to you. The broken egg is rough to the touch and more solid than you thought it would be. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well have a drink then. I mean I know you don’t do it a lot, but I think the start of our new lives is call for it. I’d drink with you, but I think I might have had my limit. Any more and I’ll be dancing naked through the streets! Hey remember that time I nearly did that in Teckleville before you stopped me?” <EOS>
<BOS> No help comes though and it’s apparent that Flynn doesn’t give a shit about either one of you at this point. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s enough, child,” Samuel says walking across the mat. <EOS>
<BOS> Rom thought back to his childhood. What had always cheered him up? Bedtime stories! Excited to have a new plan, he began to tell the horses stories at night - any little fable or thought that came into his mind. This worked far better than his other plans, but too well - the horses in his care grew to love the tales so much, they could not sleep without them! While the horses in one section would sleep soundly and wake spirited, those in the sections who did not get a tale would stay up late and wake despondent. <EOS>
<BOS> “So free room then?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wow, surprised anyone else defended me. But yeah, I heard Annah lived, I was glad to hear it too. She wasn’t the best girlfriend, but she didn’t deserve that asshole Klint stabbing her.” <EOS>
<BOS> A couple days pass and the time to meet up with Percy is at hand and you haven’t been looking forward to it. <EOS>
<BOS> “You Ebony Claw?” you ask the man. <EOS>
<BOS> “Is she dangerous?” You ask, a little concerned now at the attention the mysterious woman gave you. <EOS>
<BOS> You draw your sword and try to swing it at the orc. Unfortunately the orc’s morning star partially wraps around it. Between riding and awkwardly trying to fight, you don’t have enough grip to pull the sword back, especially since the orc is much stronger and pulling his own weapon back as well. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t think we’re really dating types anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> “And you’re Ardan I presume. Surprised I haven’t seen you sooner.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You immediately ask him how did he sleep and about his dreams. Naturally the boy is still groggy, but he soon answers your questions since he thankfully remembers his conversation with Fel who did indeed visit him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, mostly orcs, some humans. All assholes.” <EOS>
<BOS> You honestly are at a bit of a loss. Instinct is screaming at you that this a bad idea, but along with the emotional shit Madeline is laying on you, it doesn’t help that she feels real good against you right now. <EOS>
<BOS> You put on the woman's kirtle over your own robes and tie the belt, then wrap the scarf over your head and let it trail like many women do. It's hardly a perfect disguide, but in the twilight you'd be mistaken for an old woman, rather than revealed as an old man. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah’s eyes instantly go wide and then they narrow with a “Get the fuck out of here.” look. Meanwhile her little dog has also seen you and unlike with everyone else, it has decided to growl and give a little bark before running behind someone’s leg. <EOS>
<BOS> “There you are boss! We’ve been looking all over for ya!” one of them remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “No. You two just focus on the physical part of this ritual and we’ll be doing the rest. Though it is going to be vital that you last at least more than two minutes.” <EOS>
<BOS> "What difference does it make as long as it gets the job done? Besides, as I said, I thought we weren't Talons anymore. There's no code of silence being broken." Vaughn remarks as Zal reluctantly agrees. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, well I’ll just go say goodbye to Vaughn and get the hell out of your way.” <EOS>
<BOS> You tuck your pack under the cot and try to settle down. As the Current Asset moves out to sea, the rocking of the ship worsens. It is no gentle sway, but a nauseating tilt. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well if you’re worried about that, we could always stick to children.” <EOS>
<BOS> "We'll save you the humiliation and possible punishment," they say, "rejected." <EOS>
<BOS> “I can see into your mind. We’re bonded remember? Now granted that bond was severely weakened when I left this realm, but now? You’re like an open book. I can see shit in your mind that you’ve blocked out which is exactly what you did when you were on your whore killing spree.” <EOS>
<BOS> You of course don’t waste any time heading to the Museum of the Ancients. <EOS>
<BOS> Tracking them down is fairly easy because it’s the part of the city that EVERYONE is avoiding, lot of explosions, debris flying in the air, fire, strange lights and even stranger noises in general. <EOS>
<BOS> For two days, the caravan stays in Salt Village, trading and resupplying. You spend the time in a more casual manner, getting to know the people who call it home. Some are wanderers who fell in love with the beauty of the oasis and decided to stay. Others are hermits, who sought an isolated place unspoiled by the world. Others are retired court officials who found a tropical paradise the ideal place to retire, and others are merchants who have made it their base of operations. Overall, everyone seems light-hearted and surprisingly contemplative, prone to seeking self-improvement. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good old mom, never quite giving up on me. Okay now I got questions too, let’s go over some place to sit and talk.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey! Hey! I’m on your side! Heather needs help! Look!” you shout pointing up and towards the roof. <EOS>
<BOS> “Aw, that’s sweet, upholding our alliance. And who says there isn’t honor in the underworld.” Heather says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Annah, what the fuck is wrong with you?! We could have been killed!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh? This should be good.” Madeline says with a tone of snark that you decide to ignore for now. <EOS>
<BOS> Granted half of the people are your customers, so you’re probably a big part of the problem. <EOS>
<BOS> “Plus…this isn’t just some stupid crush like you probably think it is. You’ve been so nice to me. I think…I think I’m really starting to…” <EOS>
<BOS> “For what?” Madeline says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Stop, stop! Seriously, this could be dangerous for you!” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> That’s been a more common sight too nowadays. Even on your way here, you were trying to avoid getting caught up the various groups of protesters that have been more frequent. Part of you wonders if Warts doesn’t have the right idea, but at this point you’ve got a few loose ends that need to be tied up first. <EOS>
<BOS> And Tanya knows it. In fact she just steps closer to the edge of the circle. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point you stop Annah from hitting you again and try to maintain some control over this situation. <EOS>
<BOS> "(Sigh) Fine then get someone else to do it! Why do you have to fight me on this right now? I'm going to go see the girls and tell them they got the week off or at least they got the week off here. Don't really care if they whore somewhere else." <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh? Wait, this wasn’t an older guy was it?” you ask, suddenly wondering if it was Sneaks. (You never did learn what happened to him) <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well. Assuming you succeed in helping us, I swear by the purity of the shadows provided by Fel that give us protection against our enemies that I will help you when you call upon it in the future and extend that protection to you. Now, do you have an idea of which way you want to go with the attack?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well yeah. I don’t exactly have some bond with dis place. I mean it wuz fun while it lasted, but looks like its come to an end. I mean maybe dis place will be better again in a couple years or so. An’ didn’t you make plans to retreat to Jicol is shit started to go wrong?” <EOS>
<BOS> You have little time and it isn’t much, but you try to reassure her that it isn’t either of their faults. You’d like to calm her down some more, but there are a bunch of people soon banging at the door. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya doesn’t even give you a chance to respond, she just turns away from you and takes off across the rooftops again. You don’t follow, not due to fearing for any violent repercussion, but more because you’re not exactly feeling up to leaping across rooftops right now. Instead, you go ahead and loot the Ebony Claw members’ bodies. Sort of makes up for not getting anything from the museum. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah I think so.” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> You realize this is going to take a lot of sweet talk to patch this relationship up and in the back of your mind if you’re successful, you’re still going to have another issue to deal with, but maybe if you explain the curse to her, she’ll be sympathetic. <EOS>
<BOS> After spending even more quality time with Annah (which took longer than you meant to) you’re putting on your pants, grabbing your pack with tools, steeping over Checkers (who has been sleeping most of the time she’s been here) and rushing out the door. <EOS>
<BOS> “Any others?” <EOS>
<BOS> "I'll take the perfume," you finally decide. It's a significant investment, but you hope it pays off. The shopkeeper puts it in a dark padded box, to keep light from degrading the perfume, and you head with your purchase back out into the harsh sunlight. <EOS>
<BOS> You see your men hesitate to draw near as they can clearly tell you’re acting differently. The dark form of Lorthander watches with interest. Then you see him. The Emperor. He sits atop his wyvern, peering over the war-torn capital city from the next fortress tier. His pauldrons curve up in a crescent moon shape, flickering sunlight, matching the gold mask covering his face. You will your body to move, but it doesn’t. The Unbroken is in command. <EOS>
<BOS> At which point you collapse nearly directly on top of her and fall asleep or rather lose consciousness. <EOS>
<BOS> “I do actually. I’m looking for Rook, I got important business with the man and I don’t exactly know how to contact him so I came here.” <EOS>
<BOS> Time passes and while a few people attempt to speak to you, and few others seem to be talking about you (Mostly about your clothes) you basically ignore them all and just keep to your plan of moving about and sticking to areas where there are less people. <EOS>
<BOS> You open it up and it just explains that he’ll be bringing various objects to detect and dispel any curses you might have brought on by infernal creatures. He goes on to assure you that he’s studied infernals and has all the confidence that he can fix it. Of course he also gives you a price too for his time. It’s actually a pretty high number, and you’re sort of surprised that a wizard would be interested in such “mundane” rewards, but in any case, it’s doable and certainly no object for getting rid of a curse. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shut the fuck up! You trying to get the Watch to arrest us? Ow! My fingers!” you exclaim as Vera manages to bite your fingers. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait. That masked blonde at the baroness’ party? Fuck! If I wanted to kill any of them, it would have been her! That bitch fucking picked my pockets while I was asleep and ran off!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> "More amusing than dark," she laughs, "but pleasant enough entertainment." They all tip you a bit of coin as an acolyte brings in a large chalice of wine. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually in a month your agent returns to you none the worse for wear. He explains he had no problems whatsoever. Also says that he delivered your message and explains to you that a wizard going by the name High Mage Teklis says he’s interested in your situation and will meet with you in a week since he was supposed to visit the Holgard magic school anyway for a potential exchange of ideas. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well it could be that this is an opportunity you won’t want to miss. Especially seeing as you’re currently too poor to afford a room in this shithole. Look, here’s the deal, we’re in a little trouble with the law right now and have to lay low for a while. In fact we’re probably going to be leaving soon after we have our drinks. However, I have to make a delivery to a man in Sivak, are you familiar with the city?” <EOS>
<BOS> Your words are interrupted by a flying apple. You dodge it and Annah’s eyes go a bit wide when she sees you come at her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I suppose it’ll be the only way. Shit…” <EOS>
<BOS> Blood. Lots of it. Too much for one man. The ground shows more imprints and what looks like a drag mark. Several arrow shafts lie broken on the ground, some firmly planted into tree trunks. Your senses sharp, something alerts you of another’s presence. A man stands, unmoving, behind you. You turn to face him, noticing the craftsmanship of his bow; it’s unlike any you’ve seen before. It’s not extravagant. It’s a simple design, really. The quality of the wood is what draws your attention. Smoothly bent and shaped, the bow is of the finest quality, befitting of a king’s weapon. The man’s youthful face is centered by a thick black moustache. Two gray eyes return your stare, seeking your intentions. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thank you for the distraction. Shit, I’m fucking exhausted dealing with asshole.” Heather says and indeed looking very worn. In fact, she even looks a bit older. <EOS>
<BOS> “No.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve moved and thrown aside exactly one large desk and that’s when you hear a scream. You slowly turn your head and see that Tanya has broken through whatever magical defenses Heather had and cut her in half. Heather was no slouch as a wizard, for Tanya to have easily killed her like that...it just defies words of how powerful she’s gotten. <EOS>
<BOS> When you get back, most of them are a bit on edge, but others are just lazing about playing cards or just generally doing nothing. <EOS>
<BOS> “What about you? What are you going to eat?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Apparently it's always been in their mother's name and she did run it briefly before she started having health problems and let her children run it instead. She mostly stayed out of the day to day operations, but every now and then she leaves her home to drop in on her children...and well you know the rest." <EOS>
<BOS> From what little you know of Holgard, it sounds more like a city you could thrive in. The first problem is going to be getting there though. Holgard is still located in a wilder region of the land so road maintenance isn’t always an option due to marauding monsters or bandits. In fact it might not even be safe to stay on the road. <EOS>
<BOS> “True, but this is a lot different. At least on the job you have the necessary skills to pull it off. This is more like a roll of the dice. Not to mention, YOU haven’t even met Scales. If he sees you, he’s likely to just assume you’re an interloper. At least he knows me. Though I’m not sure if he liked, disliked or was indifferent to me. Never could tell what that lizard was thinking in the short time I knew him.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck! Little shit!” you say and kick the beast off of you causing it to yelp and hide behind Annah though still growling. <EOS>
<BOS> “Really?” <EOS>
<BOS> Form three! Your breath becomes heavy, labored by the intensity of the practice. Still, you press on, not allowing your physical limitations to hold you back. It’s even more of a motivator, not letting your physical form affect the forms. Your jaw clenches as you deepen your breathing to continue on. Each movement is paired with a breath. You time it perfectly, allowing the fresh morning air to fuel your muscles. <EOS>
<BOS> As you lean against the ship's railing look out at the setting sun, you try to keep your own sanity by thinking of happier times with your sister or Zalmora. You hope either of them are doing a hell of a lot better than you are right now because this is without a doubt the WORST idea you ever had. <EOS>
<BOS> A month passes and the entire island feels like it’s under the shadow of the Syndicate. Everyone is on edge expecting a Syndicate attack even if it is a little too early. You still keep Kol locked up for his own safety, but he’s obviously not happy about it. At this point he’s wearing an anti-magic ring to nullify any potential contact with Fel since the last thing you need is a god whispering in your son’s ear. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Hold on, hold on, I'm...by Joachim, you haven't aged!" a short old woman exclaims when she opens her door. <EOS>
<BOS> You take your coin from Saldinius and make your way back to your humble room back at an inn. (Some things never change) <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well that won’t be happening.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> It suddenly occurs to you that maybe there are traps about, but they’re magical in nature. You start cutting the glass and who knows what might happen. The daggers seem like there is possibly less danger involved seeing as they just fastened them to the wall. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 19 <EOS>
<BOS> “I know, but I’m fucked up enough to find that enticing in some weird way, but only if it was you of course.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Bah…if youz let me die, you woulda been lost.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Wait, so when would we get married?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well guess I better hear it then.” <EOS>
<BOS> Sensing that despite being taken off the hit list, your “immunity” only gets you so far. If you caused trouble here, you are not making it out alive. You just nod and back slowly out of the Poison Blade Inn and make your way out of the neighborhood as quick as possible. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya, move out of the way.” You say fully intent on killing Garrick <EOS>
<BOS> At this point you stand up and have to do everything within your power to not attack Flynn. You know he’d probably easily disintegrate you before you could even do anything, but the temptation is still there. However you aren’t adverse to verbal abuse. <EOS>
<BOS> “Bullshit. You don’t know shit about Tanya. You’ve been making shit up in your delusional mind. Wishful thinking about shit that’s never going to happen! Okay asshole, if you know so much, why don’t you give us a little history lesson?” <EOS>
<BOS> he old bat drives a hard bargain and she's called your bluff. As much as you might try to be some ruthless crime lord, there's still some things you can't bring yourself to do. Murdering an old lady in cold blood is one of them. <EOS>
<BOS> “What do you mean?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ok, sorry I asked. What should we do?” <EOS>
<BOS> You leave the staff behind. Even if it were true that the muses were behind the loss of stories, how could you bring yourself to destroy them? <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh? You’re movin?” <EOS>
<BOS> It was too large for any of them to open, but it seemed revealing it was enough. Several of the gods descended, expecting to see the mighty creatures they had chosen. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, it’s too late now, he’ll be open in the morning though.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I mean Vaughn's told me what you want and I just don't think I can do it. I don't have the skill or knowledge." <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey! Tha…That’s it? Just like that and you’re just fucking kicking me out?! What about the rest of my clothes and belongings?!” <EOS>
<BOS> “It may appear that way to the ignorant faithless, but I assure you that is not the case. We are merely biding our time and will strike when the time is right.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Are…are you actually asking me? You seem to have all the answers, you figure it out. But while you’re trying to figure it out, go do what you’re actually good at and go kill our enemies. GO! Get the fuck outta my sight!” <EOS>
<BOS> "Who's Gregory?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey I said I was also hungry, didn’t you bring any food?” Annah remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, how generous of you. Fuck it, I guess I’m in, can’t speak for anyone else still alive though. I just hope you do as good of a job in a leadership position as you are at killing people.” <EOS>
<BOS> At her mention, Mira pulls a blanket over her exposed breasts. She notices Rexx looking down and realizes the blankets didn’t cover everything and quickly corrects the action lower down. Rexxus coughs, showing a little more embarrassment than she would have thought from an Imperial soldier. Maybe it’s due to the fact he was caught looking. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because fuck you that’s why. You’re not special, it’s going up for everyone. Speaking of not being special, I’m not your fucking personal secretary, so if you got lowlifes looking for you again, don’t expect me to pass along another message!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Say no more! We’ll do everything to try to accommodate your needs as long as you have the coin and don’t worry, your discount is still in place!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well yeah, there’s always a chance, such are the whimsical ways of Yag, but the odds just ain’t lookin’ good enough for me to take da risk, so I’m off whether you’re sticking around or not, but I’d rather you leave with me, because…” <EOS>
<BOS> "Um...what exactly are you saying?" You ask, sort of already knowing, but just wanting confirmation. <EOS>
<BOS> There are so many lies and propaganda now, that it’s far easier to just keep piling more bullshit on top of it rather than even keeping it all-straight anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> "There may be, but I do not know it." Her voice in your head grows fainter, and you strain to focus on her last words: "I'm sorry, the power within me is fading. I love you, time has not changed that. But I need you to think beyond me. You are the one chosen by the One God for this task, not I. Go where you are called, and my love will always be with you." <EOS>
<BOS> Annah goes into great detail about her place of residence and everything you’ll find in it. She mentions the safe itself is under the bed, but points out that Jenny has a few nice pieces of jewelry in another more accessible box on her dresser. When you ask if she knows what’s actually in the safe, Annah says as far as she knows there are some valuable family heirlooms in there and probably a few gems and coins as well. <EOS>
<BOS> Noises filter through from the other side of the thin wall. What you guessed was a cargo area appears to be crowded with people. Perhaps sailors, but the voices seem angry and morose. You imagine you hear animals, as well. Pigs, perhaps, and horses. <EOS>
<BOS> "I have heard you are a noble flier," the snake approached the eagle next. "Capable of touching the highest sky." <EOS>
<BOS> “Fine, you’re an asshole like everyone else in this trade then. Thanks for what information you did provide and apologies for wasting your time.” <EOS>
<BOS> Warts suddenly stops drinking. He ponders your words a bit and then sniffs the top of the bottle. Then he promptly gives a little shrug. <EOS>
<BOS> You hesitate to take a bite - are they charging for this? <EOS>
<BOS> “Hopefully. Well we’re finally here. Definitely bigger than I thought, we probably can get better bearings of this place tomorrow during the day. So you want to go find that inn the guard mentioned?” <EOS>
<BOS> Rook is rubbing his face at all the information you’ve been dropping on him. On top of all his other concerns, this is all a bit overwhelming. Meanwhile Lloyd has managed to calm himself down long enough for him to start talking again. <EOS>
<BOS> “You going to leave with your pirate boyfriend?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright. I’ll take you to him then.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Willow," you say to her still, gray husk, "I have been on a long journey, seeking this Grove, but there has been sorrow along the way. Even Ivani, my precious wife, tells me I must move on from her and answer a deeper call. But what can be deeper  than the love I have for her?" <EOS>
<BOS> “You don’t want to go yourself? I would have thought this would be something so important that you’d want to directly deal with it.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, but…I dunno…I guess it’ll just be sort of strange. We’ve been a team for so long.” <EOS>
<BOS> It still takes a few hours, but you soon reach the end, arriving around noon in a sort of bunk-room. The stone, unfortunately, doesn't work outside the passage, so you leave it behind on one of the shelves. <EOS>
<BOS> It's hard to remember much of anything. <EOS>
<BOS> "Thousand gold pieces is a lot of money." <EOS>
<BOS> “You better have a REAL good reason for coming in here.” One of them says shoving your shoulder a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Can’t you just go steal from the hospital?” Hank asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “What I don’t understand is how you lot let yourselves get in this position in the first place. I mean you fuckers sneak about silently, turn invisible, and are one with the shadows. I mean arguably that’s why the Ebony Claw was so feared in the first place, due to your alliance along with its top leaders being practitioners of Shadow magic, and I imagine they couldn’t even do everything your top followers could. What about other Fel temples elsewhere? You can’t just call on help from them? Not to mention I thought you lot even had government influence. I mean I always heard the rumor that Baroness Ludmilla was a follower of Fel.” <EOS>
<BOS> No answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “And YOU had best remember that if anything out of the ordinary should happen to me on this trip, you’re not going to survive long enough to enjoy it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Considering you’re spending as much money as you are for this shit, I certainly hope she’s at least a good lay.” Zal remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> That is why he has destroyed the village; to create a small army of zombies to slow anyone down, while he uses the rest of the living villagers to draw out their life force with the book. That much energy should be enough to resurrect the dragon Serpent Fang (presuming he knows where the remains are), which under Mad Merodatch’s thrall would assure his dominance over his necromantic rivals. That and it would also give him time to delve further into the book of the damned, until his power would begin to threaten the entire world. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually the large dark skinned pirate known as Zamed comes into dock and you have a meeting with him as soon as he gets off the ship. He’s a little surprised, but intrigued. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera’s expression begins to change from one of despair to one of hope. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, you’ve found me, and I hope for your sake, you’ve come to help.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> But where is Ivani? <EOS>
<BOS> You start making notes of various ideas as you ask more questions. <EOS>
<BOS> The wedding itself is a whirlwind. You can honestly say you NEVER saw yourself ever getting married, let alone under these circumstances. Despite it being a "fake" wedding, Vaughn still gets a bit emotional saying he always saw you two ending up together. <EOS>
<BOS> Trying to make the best of this, you remain upbeat. <EOS>
<BOS> “Marco, I told you just come in if you got something important to report.” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, never did get your name.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh no. I’m merely one of the more important people in this particular city. There are far more higher ranking people than myself all over, but we all perform our tasks for things we believe in and our various loyalties right?” Rook says. <EOS>
<BOS> You walk through the dark temple and eventually to Gloom’s chambers where he sits writing something. When you enter he smiles and greets you. (You’ve always found his general friendly personality to not quite match his name, let alone his faith) <EOS>
<BOS> But then you didn’t really steal it at all or at least you didn’t steal it in this time period. The guards just found it on you, but they clearly were LOOKING for a thief. So what happened to the original one? <EOS>
<BOS> The cart and entourage of soldiers starts to slow down as you approach a large important looking white building with a lot of steps. <EOS>
<BOS> They find you wandering, half-mad, muttering to yourself. You cannot say who you are, where you've been, or where you are headed. <EOS>
<BOS> “They grow up so fast huh?” Vaughn snorts. <EOS>
<BOS> As soon as you walk in, you see a strange ogrish looking creature, but much shorter than one. In fact if it wasn't for the oversized teeth and general monstrous appearance, you might mistake it for a very muscular dwarf. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um…sure! Yeah! That’s more than enough for me and my…larger crew now!” <EOS>
<BOS> “What are you my dad?” <EOS>
<BOS> When the Current Asset reaches Pefallis but you aren't let off, then reaches Scaleport in Redsand a week later and you aren't set free, then back to Pefallis, you begin to suspect they have no plans to let you go at all. <EOS>
<BOS> The worst of it, is that guilt quickly goes away as you walk up behind her while she’s locking the door and quickly strip off her panties before taking her on all fours on the bed like you promised. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait. YOU are not going in the carriage.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well, I think as long as you didn’t go into too much detail about it, they would be fine. Mom would just do her usual mom thing of deliberately not dwelling on the potential negative and be overjoyed to see you. While dad would probably at least be civil and just glad that you’re not in prison and asking him to bail you out.” <EOS>
<BOS> You look over to your right and see your pistol lying nearby. You’ve got one shot in it and you’re not exactly in the best condition as far as accurately aiming anything right now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Royal treasures of Old Galpatis” you say to yourself as you read the sign to exhibit room. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ll be so damn glad to be out of the damn wilderness.” You say to yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> Peter seems in intrigued by your arguments, but he doesn’t show any positivity in your favor until you mention that you might be able to get the mages in Holgard on his side. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait a minute, did you say join you?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well we are at war with the independents right? I figure we can start with them. We got this big new base now, plenty of places to keep them in chains.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Right. No wait! I’m not part of the League! Fuck, youz twisted my words! Anyway, slave market is a bad idea, too much upkeep, an’ too much trouble ta capture people. Youz should just expand outside the city and send sum people ta rob the merchants on da road.” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Indeed.” <EOS>
<BOS> “And you know what I really hate? YOU. I hate the day I ever met you. I hate that you were instrumental in my current status. I hate that you summoned me back to this pathetic world. I HATE the fact that I love you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay then. Vera, you go with Gwen who will take you to the summoning room and give you a couple of other instructions. We’ll be there shortly, I just need to speak to you about something unrelated that the Baroness brought up first.” Heather remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah rolls her eyes. <EOS>
<BOS> “As I said. I’ll do it. What do you need?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Complaining.” <EOS>
<BOS> “K…wait you gettin’ married to dat girl you run around wit?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Damnit, that’s another one destroyed.” <EOS>
<BOS> Brother Samuel begins to answer when he hears a noise from outside. Was it from within the monastery walls? No, the sudden crash wasn’t muffled or distorted at all. It had to have originated in the open air. The girl hasn’t returned to scrubbing, which means she heard it too; it wasn’t just the mead. <EOS>
<BOS> “That is your concern, not mine. Release me, monk, I have answered all of your questions,” Ragar the Unbroken replies. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ready for what?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Come on, you can’t cut me a break? I’m only a few coppers short.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> "It does sound Celestial." She twists off the nose of the horse and gently waves the scent towards her nose with her fingers. "Earthy, leathery, just a hint of sour sweetness. Impressive. Official Shina," she calls to one of the advisors standing near her, "try this for me." <EOS>
<BOS> “Heather? This is unexpected. How did you know I was even here?” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck, between this and that girl. We hit the mother lode today!” one of them says. <EOS>
<BOS> You have a sinking feeling that things just got even worse… <EOS>
<BOS> “Apologies.” <EOS>
<BOS> “True, but it isn’t like there are flocks of people stepping up to join us either. Religion, perhaps even the gods themselves have seemingly abandoned this city. I suppose with all the strife I can’t really blame them either. I try to keep the faith, but it’s getting harder every day.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Properly bound infernals can be very useful sources of knowledge as well as servants. She’ll be a good addition to the temple. Also when I bind her, her hold on you will also be broken and you’ll be free.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I hope so.” <EOS>
<BOS> You shoot the two traitors that didn’t fire yet and then on the one that did. Then you shoot Gertrude in the back. With all your assailants down, you immediately check on Kol who isn’t physically hurt, but is upset by all the loud noise. <EOS>
<BOS> “No he wasn’t fucking armed, at least not openly, but he was big and asking questions. Pretty sure you know that the folks here don’t want that shit and I especially don’t want it! I swear if you bring trouble here, I’m throwing your ass out!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…great.” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh yes, this place is definitely safe. Most of these beams aren't even necessary anymore, but none of them are going to slip out of place anyway. Look!" Rob and then runs over to a beam and then putting all his weight behind his body, leans hard against it. <EOS>
<BOS> As for being married...well you could do worse than being married to a woman who's been giving you sound advice for over a decade, even if she has been a bit manipulative at times. You'd be lying if you didn't like that quality slightly. She obviously cares about you on some level and the feeling is mutual. After all, if you didn't, you would have divorced long ago. <EOS>
<BOS> The merchant licks his lips as he stares at you and it is at this moment you think you now have a general idea of how your sister and Annah must have felt when they had merchants fawning all over them. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh sure, keep me at home, to look after the kids while you go out and have fun.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> However, the little pouch of coins is real money so there’s that at least. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, well let me go address this new change to everyone.” <EOS>
<BOS> Perhaps Novo Fogrill would be willing to help you out. You never told him you were a storyteller, but over the week he did speak of the muses many times. <EOS>
<BOS> The fact that she got her little goblin friends to do it implies she’s actually a lot more dangerous than you could have imagined. You can’t help but find that a little alluring, if also a little concerning. <EOS>
<BOS> "It did catch my eye." <EOS>
<BOS> “I swear, I could make life a living hell for that girl and she apologizes to you rather than me.” Heather says shaking her head. <EOS>
<BOS> You suppose you could always ask him again later when he’s feeling less feisty. He will have likely forgotten all about your so-called insult later, of course he probably will have forgotten about the guy looking for you too. <EOS>
<BOS> The bodies shift their weight to the side and powerfully weave their hands into a defensive position. Upon movement, the bodies breathe out at exactly the same time. <EOS>
<BOS> It has to be the drinks. You’re sure of it. This whole party is probably just an excuse for rich people to have decadent orgies anonymously with each other. <EOS>
<BOS> “She might come from money, but her daddy isn’t on the council. At best the militia might do an investigation, but they aren’t going to find her.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Pity, might have been fun to deflower you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “If you wish to see it that way. If I were you though, I would see it as a first step to become an important person in certain circles.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What do you suggest we do then?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah! I wish. No, but I have been in contact with the Delantium Kingdom’s magic University and made a couple friends there while trying to get this school up and running. I’ve been told the TWO wizards he’s hired were drop outs from the university and while I wouldn’t suggest that you go up against them, I’m secure that my people will be able to handle them. So no, he doesn’t even have a squad of wizards at his command. If anything his orc mercs are going to be a bigger problem assuming they even make it to the fight that is. A lot can happen between Delantium and Holgard.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, well off you go. We’ve got a big night tomorrow so be prepared as much as you can.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Heh, I tried, but apparently the city is planning to knock it down and build something else there. Would have been nice, but I got here a little too late it seems." <EOS>
<BOS> “Me? Well other than the danger of becoming a mole in the EC, I suppose not, though you do realize how ruthless this plan is if you’re willingly sacrificing those you once called comrades for years right?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t use it much actually, but it makes me feel safe.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Who’s that next to the Grandmaster?” you ask her. <EOS>
<BOS> Jake’s job has really been doing the trick as far as distracting the Klyton militia, though maybe it’s been going a little too well. You suggested that Tom to pull him back from this two years ago, but predictably he never did. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?!” <EOS>
<BOS> You face palm at your situation. The tree thing you’re flexible on, but a fire? That’s potentially asking for trouble. Still, if you make a fire, you’ll hopefully shut Annah up. <EOS>
<BOS> “Over there? I just came from over there and I didn’t see it.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> “I could use a last prompt for my story. Think of a character – it could be a person or animal, anything that thinks or moves – something that resonates with the core of your being.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I find that hard to believe.” You retort. <EOS>
<BOS> “I have to say, never met someone who had a relationship with a succubus and gone on to live a relatively normal life. Usually they’re either killed by said succubus or less common, they commit suicide after an extended period time of separation. Of course I guess it helped you met her before she completely transformed. I imagine your short lived relationship with her was very special.” Teklis says. <EOS>
<BOS> You didn't think much about it when Carl and Annie disappeared. If anything you were somewhat happy you didn't have to deal with them anymore. This however is something different. You've taken to hiding in the sewers again, with guards constantly posted outside your office to make yourself less of a potential target. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well then I guess this concludes our business again. Next time we see each other, I trust you’ll have that vital information for me. Time is growing short you know, and I would hate to see you on the wrong side.” Rook says and pats you hard on the side of your face a couple times before walking away. <EOS>
<BOS> "Regina! I knew you'd come back to me! I'm coming darling!" You suddenly hear a voice shout which fortunately breaks your concentration. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re welcome, but I’d say you saved mine first seeing as that orc would have caved my skull in if you hadn’t shown up.” You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> “Your wife probably would have sold me until I noticed how she was struggling with looking after your son while conducting her business. I quickly begged to help her by explaining I looked after my own little brother many times. I’m still not sure how I convinced her, but here we are.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, I can…ugh!” you get out before taking a blade to your body repeatedly. <EOS>
<BOS> Right now you’re having difficulty even imagining having one! Your mind is going all over the place and you’re having a hard time coming to grips with this. You certainly never saw yourself as a father. Should you even be bringing up a kid in this sort of life? <EOS>
<BOS> You immediately go for the window in the room and your hopes of a speedy escape are dashed when you find out the damn thing has been painted shut. Doesn’t help that the window is slightly higher than you’d like, making even trying to pull it upward a chore. <EOS>
<BOS> “You ever heard of Jicol?” <EOS>
<BOS> As the clods of dirt and rocks begin to bury you and yours, all you can do is curse loudly to whatever gods may be listening before you are silenced forever. <EOS>
<BOS> “You will son. You win.” You answer reassuringly. “We’re not taking any chances with them somehow escaping, I want to see this done right. I’m going to have enough people with me that the odds are going to be heavily in my favor though.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Bah, dat’s average fer hobs. How do ya think we replenished da tribe’s numbers so quick? So youz ever gonna get started on a family now dat youz got a proper job and home now?’ <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh come on, that’s pride talking. Fuck pride. I mean this place is potentially standing in the way of a shitstorm and I’d rather pull you out of its direction. And while it might be a drop in coin, trust me we do just fine in Jicol. We’ll do even better if we aren’t paying off the Syndicate anymore too.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I gotta say, I never agreed with all your decisions, but I never thought I'd see the damn day when you'd go fucking limp dick soft. What, so the Klyton militia assholes come sweep the place and you lose your damn balls?" Camid remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, the Elder at the time was being sort of a dick to her and I bumped into her crying about it. Seeing an opportunity, I sort of reassured her of her worth and well you know how women fall for that sort of thing. One thing lead to another and I think she’s always been a little sweet on me after that. As for the plan, I was supposed to just come in here with my people, break the orb so you couldn’t use any magic and then make sure all of you were dead.” <EOS>
<BOS> Warts never appears to be bright a lot of times, but it’s insight like that which always reminds you that he isn’t as stupid as he tries to pretend. <EOS>
<BOS> “So where are we getting these slaves again?” <EOS>
<BOS> And with those last words, Tom makes you an example by shooting you in the other eye. This time the wound is fatal. <EOS>
<BOS> He moves in for the kill as she hits the ground, but it’s best opening you’ve got now. You fire and hope the figure in the center is the real one before you collapse again. <EOS>
<BOS> "Vaughn, will you shut the hell up? Now Rob, what do you mean you can't do the job exactly?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Considering you thought your family might be dead or in danger, this information isn’t nearly as bad, but it’s still pretty hard hitting and half of the problem is you don’t know if Percy isn’t just telling you this to fuck with you. The other half is you can’t dismiss it either. In fact, his story is more plausible than you’d care to admit. <EOS>
<BOS> “No…I was planning on…agh…doing that when I got to the mainland.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I don't have any money on me right now, but I might be back to get one later." <EOS>
<BOS> “Where’s Lucy? Usually she’s serving drinks tonight.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, which is why I’m less than enthused. I mean no offense, but if your order only mainly consists of you and a few acolytes now, why would I abandon the Felians for you lot? This seems like you’re just wanting to wipe out the Felians and you need my numbers to help you do it. And why now anyway? You two haven’t had any problems. Even during the faith war here, you two didn’t have any trouble.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Pfft. I’m not worried about that.” Elana says and then brandishes a small ornate pistol. Smaller than other ones you’ve seen actually, but you still don’t want to risk getting shot by it and move out of the way when she thoughtlessly points it at you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Protection, in fact we’ve a lot to discuss. However, I think things are going to be fine.” <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t imagine that convincing them is going to be easy, in fact you might have to wait a bit before trying. Go there when you’ve built up a bit more muscle as a show of force. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because if you were paying attention, you’d see there’s a blade trap almost well hidden in the roof of the safe. Had I not been here, you’d be giving me hand jobs with your left hand rather than your right in your foreseeable future.” <EOS>
<BOS> You decide to get right to the matter. <EOS>
<BOS> It actually isn’t too bad, but that might be because you’re standing next to Warts and his own stench is cancelling out that of the sewers. <EOS>
<BOS> Marco pulls a knife and begins to look for an opening to which to attack. You just watch him. <EOS>
<BOS> “So you’re saying we should got rob a wizard.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Okay. So you're saying you want a hired assassin? Great. You know any? Because I sure don't." <EOS>
<BOS> You at first wonder if you hit the ground so hard that it damaged your head so you can’t understand what people are saying anymore, but given where you are and how everyone is dressed, you’ve got a bad feeling that you’re a LONG way from Holgard anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> “Warts, I’ll admit I’m not completely familiar with the growth size of hobgoblins, but I know damn well that’s no teenager.” <EOS>
<BOS> You look around and now you see several people doing more than just kissing now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Mr. Reynolds…I love your daughter. I can’t just take off and leave without at least presenting my side to her.” You say, mustering all your courage, which causes a smile from Mr. Reynolds. <EOS>
<BOS> You remember that Mr. Reynolds once said Olaf was married to a halfling. You can't imagine how that birth was even possible let alone how she survived the process. It does however explain Junior's strange appearance by ogre standards. (Or any standards actually) <EOS>
<BOS> “What? You a shapeshifter or something?” <EOS>
<BOS> Klint’s screams become gurgles as he clutches his bloody throat. His body convulses a bit as you stand up drenched in blood. You don’t stand there and watch him die however, you instead run over to Annah who is still bleeding out with a knife in her belly. <EOS>
<BOS> “If that were true she would be ripping my head off right now. Gwen, I saved your life twice today, you can do me this favor.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Say that to his face.” <EOS>
<BOS> Your mom on the other hand as you’re hastily grabbing a few items, is tearfully going on about how you (And your sister) wasted your potential and she doesn’t know where she and your father went wrong. <EOS>
<BOS> Frustration increases… <EOS>
<BOS> “Surprised you just didn’t tell your men to kill me on sight.” <EOS>
<BOS> "A storyteller?" Captain Brost arches a brow. "I'll keep that in mind. Take him below deck for now." <EOS>
<BOS> “Hell if I know, we’re not together any more.” <EOS>
<BOS> This session quite unlike anything you’ve ever experienced. It’s raw; it’s dirty and it almost feels violent. <EOS>
<BOS> Tom might have a point there. A really good point actually though he’s probably got the added idea that if shit goes wrong with Jake, then Zal will just be the one who suffers. <EOS>
<BOS> You transfer the bottles out of Wart’s pack and into your own and after a few exchanged words, you and he parts ways. You can’t say this was the best night out, though you’d be lying if a small part of you didn’t get a minor thrill out of it all. You might have even enjoyed all this, if you made out with more stuff. <EOS>
<BOS> The man, Richard, leads you through the forest, taking many paths that are naturally hidden by the overgrowth. You can’t imagine the Empire could follow your tracks, Richard expertly hides any sort of disturbance you create along the way. The Empire would have to burn the entire forest to reach you, a disturbing thought considering that was a very real possibility. <EOS>
<BOS> “No. You won’t be staying here. Clearly you’re unhappy in Holgard and you’re really unhappy with our business arrangement. Not really a good idea to keep someone on that’s a ball of anger and frustration. So as I said, you are a free man and the world is your oyster. I’d advise you not entering the Delantium Kingdom, Holgard or Jicol though as you are no longer welcome in ECS territory.” Percy says. <EOS>
<BOS> “I…I don’t want to leave you guys. I want to stay here.” Your son suddenly says. <EOS>
<BOS> You look around and then hear it again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Debts? The only one I can think of between us is him repaying me for saving his life.” <EOS>
<BOS> But is that a light? You notice the path beneath you forks, leading off in a crude trail to a cabin half a farspan away. A flickering lantern rests on the windowsill. Surely, no one would turn away a Pilgrim in a storm? <EOS>
<BOS> “Annah, I’m trying to tell you, I really think we should get out of here right now. There’s Klyton Militia about outside and it’s a little disconcerting that your friend Jenny came home while I was in the middle of robbing the place.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Step to the altar, prince. See what I see,” Lorthander answers. “Everything I do, I do for the lineage of your father, of you, Prince Ragar.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Let me guess, you weren’t caught stealing food either.” <EOS>
<BOS> Doesn’t take long before Vera comes to see you. <EOS>
<BOS> Your next plan is to follow the road and hopefully you’ll eventually reach your destination. It’s not ideal and you’re still not exactly sure of the directions, but you’re hoping you can figure it out as you go or hope that the Empire at least has signs on their more isolated roads even if they apparently don’t have proper security on them. <EOS>
<BOS> “Any ideas on how they knew you were coming? Is there a traitor within King Aeric’s ranks?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? Where’s she going?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Bitch? You fucking shithead, why don’t you…” Annah starts to say before you interrupt <EOS>
<BOS> While it isn’t certain that Zal was successful and just stayed or she was killed, what is certain is that enough time has passed that it’s pretty clear that the Bloody Smiles are no longer sending anything back to the Crimson Talons. A “clean break” or not, Jake has gone his own way. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay boss.” Marco says and leaves. <EOS>
<BOS> And then you see a pair of eyes in the darkness. <EOS>
<BOS> Shade doesn’t take it and instead gives you a bit of a suspicious look. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually the ECS representative comes calling for their cut (with back interest), they find that the Nocturnal League is no more in the city and they can’t do shit to you about it because you’re practically the right hand of the baroness. <EOS>
<BOS> “I thought pirates were currently banned from Jicol.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What the hell are you doing on this part of campus? These fuckers don’t have any coin and if you’re trying to sell them drugs, you’re doomed to fail since most of them all smoke that shitty version of Green Lotus that they grow themselves. Barely even gets you high.” Annah remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Uh…okay…” <EOS>
<BOS> Seeing as you’re in the air, it’s almost like you’re swimming. It’s all pretty surreal and you’re expecting this illusion to end. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, THAT was some of your best work. Shit, even I was starting to get a little choked up.” You say smiling. <EOS>
<BOS> “…you… YOU?! You’re her father?!” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> The funny thing is, it isn’t restricted to go there, but there is little reason for the average non-magical person to do so. For one thing it’s a very long journey and not in the most hospitable place of the Empire (Close to the Cloudpeake Mountains) Second, it isn’t like the average Empire citizen wants to hang around a bunch of unhinged miscreant magic types. Though for you, it’s probably your only possible chance at getting back home. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um? Um is not a plan you halfwit. Am I just wasting my time here?” <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile, you’ve been more or less successful in building up the Talon’s numbers. Not as much as you’d like, but since you’re the only one doing it, it is what it is. Despite all this extra help however, it’s not being utilized properly. Most of it is being sent to help Jake as his numbers get whittled down every now and then and that’s really a waste you believe. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ll be fine. Don’t get yourself killed. I’d hate to obligate myself to that pretty wife of yours, Seth answers. <EOS>
<BOS> “Have it your way, but here’s one more for the road. If you REALLY aren’t fucking big tits McRed, you better have a little chat with her because I’ve seen how she acts when you speak with each other. Maybe you’re oblivious, but the girl has a serious crush on you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, her?” Kragan answers after a long pause, “let’s just say she keeps things from getting too dull around here. Why; do you think she is up to something?” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s an null orb and it’s from my own personal collection.” Heather says. <EOS>
<BOS> “They say it’s a wise man who knows his limitations. Perhaps by making your home in an old temple once dedicated to Fel has resulted in him providing that wisdom. Ah, tis a shame that the Syndicate only just started sending people this way. Reclaiming a lost temple to his great shadow would have been not just a boon to the Syndicate, but to the glory of Fel.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Did you say Fel?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wow, I just thought after yesterday, you weren’t interested. Well this is great, you’ll see!” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Never mind all that, would he be able to do the job?" You ask <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora is certainly pleased about all this and says she knew you’ d be able to convince Tom better than anyone else. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good question. Can’t stay out here in the wilderness.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Feeling cooped up?" Captain Brost asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thriving slave trade? As far as I know there aren’t any slave rings in Jicol.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, but his powers might become uncontrollable without proper guidance and I think you both know just how dangerous shadow magic can be. He’s obviously been chosen by Fel, so I don’t think you have choice.” Gertrude remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> And so the hate fucking begins. Though Vera is blissfully unaware of this and just thinks it’s all to heighten the experience. While you’re thrusting in and out of Vera, Heather and Gwen are reciting a bunch of words that you’re trying to drown out so you can focus on the task at hand. <EOS>
<BOS> This has been stressful week. Both your best lieutenants have gone missing and in this line of work, that probably means they're dead. You'd probably feel a little worse about it, if you weren't so angry. Who the hell is doing this? <EOS>
<BOS> While being a criminal and having a family isn’t something new, it rarely works out well as enemies see it as an added potential weakness to pounce on. <EOS>
<BOS> The man with the package turns to you. <EOS>
<BOS> But she’s different now. She’s naked as well for one thing and while you’ve seen her in that state many times, you’ve never seen her skin with a red hue before. One might even say crimson color. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because I’m not a fucking wizard asshole!” you reply and then slug the driver in face. <EOS>
<BOS> Though you share a tent with two others, there is ample room. Many nights, you all decide to open the top and sleep under the open air. The nights are the clearest you have ever seen, like a painting coated in stars and smudged with vibrant colors. Sandman's trail of glittering blue cuts the sky in half, and the thick band of the galaxy frames it on either side. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya mounts you and begins grinding her body into yours. While it’s everything you ever hoped it would be, a part of you still knows this is killing you. Meanwhile the chanting of the Neroth cultists grows louder. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why would you? I tended to keep my old business life as private as possible. They were good Joachim fearing folks that didn’t have much to do with me anyway. Of course that’s also what got them killed. Ludmilla didn’t show much mercy to any of those faithful to Joachim and my parents while peaceful would never willingly give up their faith. You can guess what happened.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, I don’t care what you do with them, though aren’t you really just making other people into cannibals if you’re using corpse parts to make potions?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, um, apologies. Just sort of…overwhelmed you know. Never thought I’d be before royalty.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re not going anywhere.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah. So about these other hobs, you sure they’re going to listen to you? Last time I remember you weren’t accepted as a true hob with the Spider Fangs.” <EOS>
<BOS> You continue along the road and fortunately you don’t have any more late night encounters. <EOS>
<BOS> Shade so far is holding the advantage due to him and his people teleporting all over the place, but you imagine that won’t last long. In the meantime, you order your people to stay together and not get surrounded. <EOS>
<BOS> You try to be taken too much by surprised, but you can’t help be a little startled. <EOS>
<BOS> Tom announces the changes and like with any change, everyone has an opinion. Mostly for the better thankfully. Jake complains the loudest, but when it’s pointed out that it doesn’t matter if he kills people as much, he grumbles slightly less. <EOS>
<BOS> Soon, it’s all over and the Felians are no more as a force in this city and you’re just hoping you made the right choice in allies. Heather commands her people to start cleaning up the bodies before she goes over to speak to you. She looks a little worn and tired, but then you guess magic takes its toll just as much as regular combat. <EOS>
<BOS> "But then, the Star Poison came, and she chose to sacrifice herself for the world. You all did! I honor you for your choice. But I'm a human - not gifted with magic like a mage, nor holding the blessing of Sandrella like a muse. I am not a hero who can save the world - I'm not even a husband who can protect his wife. <EOS>
<BOS> “Virgil?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> You then ponder the idea that you keep going back to, “What if you’re meant to be here?” and that’s when you come to a damning realization. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well -- this could be falsified. How do I know this to be true?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m right here….oh shit. Fuck! What the hell did you do now?!” your dad says walking into the room. <EOS>
<BOS> “Someone like me?” <EOS>
<BOS> “These Black Hooks are dumb ass snot nosed kids.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Is that a real Daquala head on the wall?” <EOS>
<BOS> “So was it like you imagined?” she asks. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'll find it." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Mira, don’t worry. They won’t hurt you. I promise,” the Captain speaks, eating another fist from Seth for not answering his questions. “Alright, alright. I’ll tell you. I know how these things go. There’s a shaman, a man that speaks to spirits. He approached me, giving knowledge to an upcoming assault. I thought he was just a crazy old man, but sent a force on the off-chance he was correct. There’s something...strange about him. Something powerful, mysterious, like you want to find out what it is, but then again, you don’t.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you get to the summoning room, Flynn is already there with some of his people. Flynn nods when he sees you and Heather. <EOS>
<BOS> While you normally wouldn’t announce such things, you figure they want a bribe to leave you alone. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, okay, we can go do this, but I’m getting some rest first, just tell me where the place is exactly and I’ll meet you there later. When is the best time to break into this place anyway?” <EOS>
<BOS> When you finally get within sight of the docks you see several ships burning and sinking into the water. Looks like Heather is already getting to work as you see a lone figure running about casting magic into the bay area. <EOS>
<BOS> You look over to Henry who just gives you a cold glance before walking away altogether. <EOS>
<BOS> “Another criminal outfit. Much larger than us by far. They’re based in the Delantium Kingdom, but I believe they have a strong presence in Holgard too. Edmond was an idiot when dealing with them, though I guess that was mainly pride.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s a good thing Brother Trevor is making you train more. You could use it.” <EOS>
<BOS> The man suddenly asks if you know a doctor from Teckleville, and then goes into a description somewhat matching your dad, even mentions him by name. Does this man know your father? <EOS>
<BOS> You really don’t know what to make of that one. It seems as if he probably knew you were lying, but ultimately didn’t give a shit because he doesn’t really want to be helping the Ebony Claw anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> “I think you and I both know they’re going to be suspicious of you anyway, but if this helps, I will personally assist you in anyway I can in any matter. I mean maybe I never said this properly years ago, but I did appreciate that you turned down Elder Flynn’s ritual suggestion. Not something I ever forgot.” <EOS>
<BOS> You get some of your people to dispose of Vera’s body making some comment that she was an enemy to Holgard. (Not that they were going to question you anyway) <EOS>
<BOS> “Guess so if you like boring.” You mutter. <EOS>
<BOS> “Did you really expect any less? I mean shouldn’t be too hard considering you already killed your girlfriend. Besides, you’re still the best one who knows about the place, so it would still be helpful if you were there in person.” Rook says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that’s just one more sacrifice I guess. Really I’ll be fine. Let’s just…let’s just try not to fight much more okay? I’m under a lot of stress right now and it’s not helping either of us. I know I sound at this moment, but deep down for some fucked up reason I’m actually glad you’re here. At least I know you care.” <EOS>
<BOS> The man who eliminated the disruptive warring religious factions. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thank you Heather. This is more than I expected. I’ll remember this.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey! Get off our fucking asses! What gives you the right to yell at us? You’re not our fucking dad!” <EOS>
<BOS> “So what you’re saying is I should have just left the girl to get tortured and killed. I’ll remember that for next time.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Went above and beyond huh? Guess he really is getting sure of himself. Might as well see for ourselves." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Ideally, you’d like to use the old Thieves’ Guild location. The problem with that is it’s currently an underground slave market and run by the closest thing to a “criminal organization” still left in Holgard. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m a little lost here, who killed Camid?” Vaughn asks. <EOS>
<BOS> The pair of you look at each other briefly, and its almost like the Shadow Blade is telling you already that he thinks you’re lying. It’s enough to put some fear into you though you hold it together and go inside the mansion. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well sis, whether things are working out for you or not right now, at least your exit wasn’t like this.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, that doesn’t sound good. Well send him in here, maybe he killed at least one of them.” <EOS>
<BOS> You wake to screams. <EOS>
<BOS> Heather makes a nervous laugh. <EOS>
<BOS> “I was going to suggest that maybe it’s time we start looking to better opportunities because Holgard in its current state isn’t getting any better for us. That baroness bitch has become miss law and order all of a sudden and she’s even employing more magic in this task now thanks to her new alliance with the Dornans!” <EOS>
<BOS> You wait an hour until the morning visitors to the garden look a bit tired of walking, then set up by one of the fountains that has viewing benches around it. The traveling merchant, seeing an opportunity, points you out to the individuals and groups, herding the small crowd your way. You see why he is so enthusiastic about pointing out the storyteller to the others, as he pulls out hot thermoses and sweet treats, selling them snacks and drinks as they sit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t even think about it sweetheart. I can pull this trigger before you can utter an incantation.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> "Have they found any answers?" <EOS>
<BOS> As you take a moment to remember the phrase, Mr. Scars continues. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why don’t I come with you?” <EOS>
<BOS> “What the hell?! How did we get here?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> While they do not allow you to go ashore, Spryve does bring back a better doctor's kit. It looks well-used, but the tools inside are good and there is plenty of fine, sturdy thread for stiching as well as some gloves. He sets you up in another small room down below - though this one has a door to the main hold which you are warned not to go through. You lay out a clean cloth on the table there and set supplies out on the shelving. Sabry brings you some boiled water to put in a large tub. It won't stay hot, but at least it will be clean. <EOS>
<BOS> To their credit, the soldiers hold the wall and a few of the mages don’t even run and instead try to take out the main force approaching, but ultimately the orcs have more numbers and the leader is tough. <EOS>
<BOS> Being more paranoid than ever, you order that everyone from Nightfall to Jicol be on the look out. You also make sure Kol is kept under watch as all times. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why? This is what you wanted and I warned you of the consequences. You thought you were going to be different. YOU thought you were going to steal me away from Tanya! But YOU were wrong! They ALL were! I made sure of that!” you exclaim and point your pistol at Vera. <EOS>
<BOS> You desperately go for your flintlock, but that is smacked out of your grip by a tail that whips your hand. Your next attempt is your cutlass, but a cloven hoof puts an end to that attempt by stomping on your hand and breaking it. <EOS>
<BOS> It's a hell of a lot of money and you have no real certainty. You're starting to think you might have more piece of mind investing in some weapons and doing this yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> Later… <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t think you’d actually listen to me about this.” Vera says with a smile. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, there’s no reason to go rushing headlong into battle. On top of being on horseback, the orcs are armed with bows, spears and javelins. You aren’t some heavily armored soldier and you don’t have magic powers to fire back. If you still had your pistol this might not be as big of a deal since you could easily fire back at them. Since you don’t have any of those things, you figure you’ll continue to hide in the carriage until you see a suitable opening to attack. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, what? Tell me what?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay so what are you having a problem with exactly? Wait, let me guess. It’s the whole sex thing isn’t it? Geez, you got some weird hang ups about sex.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Traitor? You’re calling ME a traitor? What the fuck did you do? You betrayed not only the Thieves Guild, but the Ebony Claw Syndicate as well! All of which I might add is ALL catching up with you. Your old pal that escaped the Guild purge recently opposed you and now the Syndicate has retaken Holgard. How long is it going to be, before THEY decide they want revenge on you as well? Fuck that, I’m making a deal before they send in the assassin squad and murder us all in that temple.” Gertrude says. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately for you, you’re so intriguing that when several military looking men come running in your direction they immediately begin shouting at you in a language that you still can’t understand. <EOS>
<BOS> You smile a little at that remark. <EOS>
<BOS> It could have gone better. Then again, it could have gone a lot worse. One thing’s for certain: their information was spot on, even if it came through mysterious origin. The Imperial captain in his tent pulls the stained white and gold armor from his chest. He places it on a wooden dummy and pulls a wet rag from a bowl beside it. He washes the bloodstains away from the elegant armor, shining it clean for the next encounter. <EOS>
<BOS> “Knew you were a smart and ambitious boy. Good, glad this is settled. Now judging the distance from here to Sivak, and you should get there in about four more days as long as you follow the roads and keep on a normal timetable of walking and resting. Too bad you don’t have a horse; otherwise you’d easily cut that time in half. I do urge you NOT to take too much longer than six days though.” Flynt says. <EOS>
<BOS> “DISBELIEVE AT YOUR OWN PERIL, BUT THERE ARE NO LIES AND THERE IS NO RETURN. YOU LOST THAT OPTION WHEN YOU STUCK WITH YOUR GREED. YOUR LIFE OF GREED HAS ALREADY COST YOU DEARLY. HOWEVER, YOU HAVE THE CHANCE AT A NEW LIFE IF YOU LET GO. CONTINUE ON YOUR PATH AND YOU WILL MOST CERTAINLY BE DOOMED.” <EOS>
<BOS> Year 36 <EOS>
<BOS> You see who could only be Mr. Reynolds. He’s even better dressed than the employee flipping the knife. As you approach he doesn’t look any older than his mid forties. Who know though and that’s not why you’re here. <EOS>
<BOS> Warts just barely avoids their attacks and tries to scramble away from his prone position, but one of the bandits manages to trip him up before he can run and it isn’t looking good as he gets kicked in the face by the other one. <EOS>
<BOS> Later, Camid arrives before you with a young red head with an ample chest. She’s dressed “down” presumably to look like she fits in, but its still obvious she is out of place here. Must be Madeline. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay then how about this? The Holgard Watch might look the other way every now and then, but they’ll stop doing that if we’re blatantly murdering people in the streets. Only they get to do that. You want to answer to Mantis when he’s bitching about one of our Blue Dream houses getting raided suddenly?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe in a few minutes. Um, you uh…good?” You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'll leave you to it, then. Pleasure doing business with you." The guide leaves. <EOS>
<BOS> Gwen gives you a small smile before leaving you to go back to the rest of her, causing Heather to make an eye roll. <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh? No. Why the hell would I do that?” Vera replies. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well because as you pointed out robbing Kenzer’s isn’t going to be an easy job and it would probably be better to have an extra pair of eyes and hands around. And…maybe this is going to sound odd from someone you don’t know, but you’re obviously a talented thief and maybe I just like a little social interaction from time to time from another one in our business.” <EOS>
<BOS> You clear your throat to call the attention back to you and off the heads you just dropped on the floor. <EOS>
<BOS> “What does she do? What the hell doesn’t she do?! She’s constantly having these ideas!” <EOS>
<BOS> "How did a small and plain creature manage this?" <EOS>
<BOS> Zal then leaves without another word. <EOS>
<BOS> “Understood.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you don’t respond immediately, Vera stops walking and stares at you expectantly. <EOS>
<BOS> “We all have someone we care about mayor. It’s a weakness, but an unavoidable one for most I think. You’re not married and this one is one of the few non military and non government people that had been seen entering this place on many occasions. So guessing this woman is a long time girlfriend? Perhaps even a daughter? Not both I hope…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, we’ve already established all that. But still, he was a valued employee. Improved much since the first time I met him…wait a minute…he’s breathing.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Erm, I just mean I don’t know much about this magic stuff. I’ve just been making sure he’s been reading this book. I did see him create a small ball of light briefly though.” <EOS>
<BOS> Before you can say another word, the two Fel priests roughly toss you down the stairs. Normally such a spill wouldn’t be that bad. Maybe a few scrapes and bruises, but the luck of Yag isn’t with you at this moment. <EOS>
<BOS> A month passes and you haven’t had any dark thoughts and nothing has happened to any of the whores or Vera. <EOS>
<BOS> “How does it sound?” Keira asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Jake falls to the ground and trips you with his legs. You fall face first and drop your weapon. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately most doesn't mean all... <EOS>
<BOS> “What are you afraid of? You obviously have a wanderlust that needs to be sated and I’m willing to travel with you so you won’t be alone on the journey. I mean we can go to different places if you like, but I figured we’d start with Galpatolis since it’s a place I know very well and there’s plenty to do there. I mean you could even bring your flute if you like. I noticed one sitting on your table. Didn’t even knew you played, I wouldn’t mind hearing you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No and I told you to stop bothering me Virgil! Don’t you have a collection box you can pilfer booze money from?” you shout. <EOS>
<BOS> You wake up fairly early, but then you didn’t really sleep much to begin with. This was more of a brief rest anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> You enter the dimly lit room and find what could only be a room dedicated to dark magical endeavors of some sort. There’s two demonic looking idols starring at you and the pentagrams and symbols on the floor aren’t any you recognize. There’s also blood splatters on them. <EOS>
<BOS> “And you?” <EOS>
<BOS> You and Annah press on past the cages. Eventually Klyton is in sight and you both quicken your pace, anxious to get to your destination as night has now fallen. <EOS>
<BOS> “Truly?” <EOS>
<BOS> Arriving near you, and still fighting off several enemies, he shouts. “There are too many of them. We must regroup at Aeric’s keep. Gather all who you can and let’s flee this place.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, I agree my skills do go to waste when the plan isn’t followed. I was supposed to pick the lock to the door and then one of you was supposed to quietly subdue the old man if he woke up and the others cleaned out the place. Instead what YOU did, was break the window on the door and unlock it that way. When that inevitably woke up the old man, you lot spent a bunch of unnecessary time taunting and beating him unconscious.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s going to be a several day journey from what you know so you’re glad when you find that you have a carriage all to yourself. You’ll be able to stretch out. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the hell is going on? Marco just came in and took a few of my best slave minders and said if I had any complaint, I need to see you because he’s just following orders.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes! And you’re the escort Dr. Gossey hired I presume. You ARE aren’t you? I’d hate to think I just woke up some random sleeping bum.” Elana answers. <EOS>
<BOS> You soon return back to the Blackheart Inn and make a request to the innkeeper before retiring to your room. <EOS>
<BOS> She also has heard that while Peter isn’t exactly a Joachimite purity zealot, his time in the Delantium Kingdom has probably given him more of an appreciation for a more orderly society as opposed to one that embraces rampant corruption so readily. So he’s most likely not going to look favorably upon the Nocturnal League. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, you greedy little bastard. Here and I think I don’t have to tell you not to brag about getting this room or the coinage. Last thing I need is people getting jealous of others, especially when they haven’t been here as long.” Tom says and hands you some gold coins from a small pouch. <EOS>
<BOS> You sit up, crunching a little so as not to hit the bed above. In the dim light you can see all the bunks are full, now. <EOS>
<BOS> “What are you going to do?” <EOS>
<BOS> You just stand there speechless for a moment. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well, we're still probably going to have some of our operations down there, but I figure we can at least start making an attempt to climb out of them. I'm thinking that we probably should stop dealing in Yellow Devil too." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “You…you just hit me with a fucking magic missile!” you wheeze, pointing out his hypocrisy. <EOS>
<BOS> “Please sir, we just want to get within the safety of the city. It’s night and we don’t want to get accosted by monsters or bandits that plague the countryside.” Annah says in a pleading voice. <EOS>
<BOS> "Come to us...let go..." You start to hear in those melodic voices again. <EOS>
<BOS> You take the opportunity to rest up some more and when the only light in the sky is that of the dim moon, that’s when you leave the edge of the woods. The trees around you soon disappear and all that’s left is you in the open countryside and the occasional sounds of nocturnal animals. You walk across the fields for a while, but as the grass starts getting knee high, you start hearing unfamiliar sounds. While you hope it is only a harmless nocturnal animal (or rather several of them judging by the noises) you get concerned that you might be at a disadvantage if it isn’t, so you quickly make your way back towards the road where you have better vision of any potential low to the ground threats. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well you said, you had to meet with those ECS assholes and didn’t want Kol around during that. And I couldn’t supervise Kol’s studies. This isn’t like Gertrude, Layla was from some well to do family that Elias’ crew apparently slaughtered on a transport ship. From the moment she was brought here she’s basically been willing to do anything from getting sold as a fuck hole to some rich pervert or something similar.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve barely gotten started fucking her up against a nearby wall and she’s already trying not to make a lot of noise and failing at it. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the college of magic? No. I mean you don’t need my permission.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, uh hey boss. You’re alive.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ha! Those empire dogs are all bark, no bite.” <EOS>
<BOS> "(Sigh) Fine. You got me by the short and curlies. I'll pay your damn price out of respect for all the years of service you gave to my family." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Gertrude is currently looking after him.” <EOS>
<BOS> “See always thinking! Which is why a direct take over wouldn’t be as efficient. I mean why come in here and stomp about establishing our dominance and wasting manpower and resources when you’re here? A perfectly reasonable and intelligent man more than capable of running things and knowing to give us our due.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, yes, I’m going…but before I do…” <EOS>
<BOS> "Could you now?" Spryce guffaws. <EOS>
<BOS> “Now don’t even start with that! Look, I don’t want to fight! Let’s just go get your necklace.” <EOS>
<BOS> A few hours later, he is true to his word, and you find yourself in a grand foyer as tall as five men stacked together. Rich colors of black, burgundy, and gold decorate the interior, and more than a few rare artifacts are on display. You are examining them, gathering inspiration for future tales, when Pelomin returns with the priest. <EOS>
<BOS> When you try to get up however, you find that you can’t move. You’re not being held down by anything either. It’s more of a force holding you down. This doesn’t fill you with confidence that your situation has improved. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sorry, I’m not a free spirited elf.” <EOS>
<BOS> Your more immediate concern however is the Mayor of Jicol who has implemented draconian measures in rebuilding Jicol due to the fact that people were starting to leave the city and even coming to Nightfall. He’s completely shut the gates to the city and not allowing anyone in or out unless it’s by ship and even then it’s only legitimate trade as Jicol has now banned all pirates and the like from using their harbor anymore. In fact if they come within a certain range of the city, they’ll be fired upon. <EOS>
<BOS> "Really? Wow, I'm actually impressed that you managed to talk a religious old lady into working with you...or did you just fuck this one into submission too?" <EOS>
<BOS> Warts also goes on about how he’s not fond of the ECS since a lot of them tend to have ties to Fel while he’s dedicated to Yag. Says that worshipping Fel if you’re a thief is like cheating since he’s the god of shadows and all. Though he’s not so much opposed to that, so much as he doesn’t like all the dedication Fel seems to want. Yag on the other hand doesn’t really require anything and he not might bless you anyway, but then he might give you a lot even if you don’t do much. Warts claims that ALL the gods are like that, so he might as well pray to one that is at least honest about it all. <EOS>
<BOS> With some trepidation, you knock on the door of the Captain's cabin. <EOS>
<BOS> The moss egg vibrated, beginning to hatch. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that checks out.” <EOS>
<BOS> Lacking any other plan, you just sit in silence as the soldiers take you to your appointed destination. It’s times like this, you wish your sister was here, she’d be able to help you. <EOS>
<BOS> KILL THEM ALL <EOS>
<BOS> “So, you’re sending me along to finish the job huh?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Indeed. I believe the High Shadow back in Delantium has had some issues with this particular branch in general, but that’s an internal matter on their end. In any case back to you, it’s all very impressive for someone of humble origins and very unusual how it all seemed to work out in your favor. One might even think you planned everything… well either that or you had the gods on your side.” <EOS>
<BOS> It's done and you quickly make your way out of the house and return to your sewer headquarters. <EOS>
<BOS> “What, have you been following me on the campus as well? Didn’t you just accuse me of stalking you the last time we met?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Enough! I tire of this game,” the Unbroken screams. <EOS>
<BOS> “We? I didn’t agree ta dis.” <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya folds her arms and smiles a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, okay.” <EOS>
<BOS> And yep, that’s what seemed familiar. Shit, you never thought you’d sound like your father, but you guess the old man’s personality is there after all. In any case, you hope you’re a little more successful than he was in getting some unruly teenagers in line. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay Randi, let’s go.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey…can I go in to get my fix yet? I’ve been waiting out here for hours!” one remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Dunno. Some of the Talons just found him in his room in the den like that. No signs of anyone breaking in or anything.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Did you say Yag?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, but Tom can’t just sit on his ass anymore about it. Jake hasn’t done it yet, but it’s only a matter of time before he splits off from the Crimson Talons altogether and takes half of our members that were assigned out there with him. Ideally we could just tell him to come home and his purpose out there is no longer necessary, but I doubt if he’ll listen.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I was thinking of taking you back to my place.” <EOS>
<BOS> Elana may have a bossy upper class way about her, but she wasn’t completely unwise in the ways of being in potential danger. <EOS>
<BOS> Camid nods smiling and walks away with a bit of pep in his step, like you’ve just promoted him or something. Well, it doesn’t take much to make some folks happy. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, probably not, but I don’t have time to worry about it right now.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Not really. She mostly beat the shit out of Carl and Annie, saying she didn't scrimp and save for the tavern just so they could turn it into a den of sin. She then left saying if they didn't take care of this, she would." Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Now that you think about it, Zal isn’t wrong on her observations. Madeline’s personality has been a lot more positive since the first time you met her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, but don’t Ardan see you taking another man inside your home! He might get the wrong idea!” <EOS>
<BOS> “So what exactly did this Jenny do to you?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Given the lot we have, I don’t think sophisticated is exactly the word that would describe most here.” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> When you reach the Laughing Devil, you almost just want to fuck her in the carriage rather than pulling your pants up and going to your room. <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, the session is pretty intense. <EOS>
<BOS> “You fucking ruined my life that’s why! YOU were the one that invited all those other poets and musicians to perform here, which showed me, how I don’t even have as much talent as a bunch of fucking college kids. Then on top of everything else you turned Hank into a brain dead zombie and made this place into a damn drug den. So now because I have no other fucking skills whatsoever, I’m stuck here trying to prop up Hank because he’s practically all I fucking got at this point and making sure this place stays afloat, that is if the militia doesn’t raid the place one day soon.” <EOS>
<BOS> One of the orcs has dispensed with ranged attacks and is concentrating on closing the gap. When you get to the bridge, he’s almost on you and swinging a morning star. <EOS>
<BOS> “Usurper…ohhh, you know about Peter Varsakken’s plans do you? Is that the real reason why you’re leaving? Well if you were concerned that he was coming here to wreck the place you need not have been. You have my assurance that Peter will fail in his invasion as usual. Business here will not be disrupted.” Percy remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Mm, so to sum up, we have a simple thief who survived the destruction of not one, but two organizations that held the most sway in the underworld here. You then went on to create your own organization, which is now the only game in town. You also apparently managed to leverage an alliance with the Temple of Fel here. That is an interesting one considering the faithful of Fel and the Syndicate have been allies for many decades. Intertwined one might even say.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well…I wouldn’t necessarily say that. However, it’s not going to be in the form of shadow demons or anything like that. That’s actually not how he works despite what the reputation might be. Now once again, do you two worship Fel or acknowledge him in small some way?” <EOS>
<BOS> “And with that, our business is concluded. I bid you good day and wish you well in your future endeavors, especially if it’s going to make the Syndicate money!” <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s very…pragmatic of you. Though I suppose your word that you at least won’t help the Felians is the best I can hope for. Very well, I shall leave you to your business. Good day.” <EOS>
<BOS> A smile lights up on her face. “It’s easily the most fun category.” <EOS>
<BOS> You're also getting a little tired of these sewers. You're supposed to be the head of a budding criminal Empire. As soon as you can, you're clearing out one of those gambling game rooms at the tavern and making it into an office. <EOS>
<BOS> “No.” you say causing a bit of a frown from Mr. Reynolds. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, you probably would be better equipped since I do have reason to believe that he’s probably highly skilled in shadow magic. While maybe with a bit of preparation my people could take him since he’s alone, but it wouldn’t be pretty. However, that wouldn’t really solve my problem. The Syndicate would just rightfully assume I killed him and then have good reason to be pissed at me and that wouldn’t be good.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Zal, do we really have to do this now?" You say. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s the first time you’ve ever used one; so the unexpected kickback nearly causes you nearly drop it. You also weren’t expecting it blow half of Graham’s stinking face off. His obese corpse slumps lifelessly against the carriage wall. <EOS>
<BOS> “This criminal claims he’s got something really important to tell you about the Blue Dream we confiscated.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Not this time.” He says and then smashes his fist into your nose, breaking it and causing blood to flow from your nostrils. You have a hard time catching your breath, but that’s a secondary feeling when Jake proceeds to break your wrist and then punch you in the face again. <EOS>
<BOS> “However, she was fortunate enough to have at one time save the life of someone currently in the top ECS leadership. He apparently has always been a little smitten with her too. So thanks to all that she was safe.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, but fuck. How is going to be any different than any other rival? They obviously don’t even give that much of a shit about this place anyway and we’ll have a complete monopoly on the underworld here. We will definitely be entrenched and they’ll have to send an army which I don’t see them doing.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, thanks.” <EOS>
<BOS> At this point, Rook slugs you in the stomach, dropping you to your knees. You didn’t even see it coming since he was standing far enough a way that he wasn’t in reach and then suddenly he was in front of you. As you struggle back up, you feel that blasted crossbow still at your back. <EOS>
<BOS> “You may do whatever you wish with it. You may throw it away, keep it and wear it, keep it and then sell it or just keep it period. It doesn’t matter. It was just my way of thanking you for not just saving my life, but also the pleasure of being in the glow of your beauty.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Your treason will be dealt with. You’ll be made an example of, and your death will dissuade any further enemies of the state,” The Unbroken speaks, blocking Seth’s attack with ease. “I will pull each nail from your body, then work my way up your limbs, peeling your skin from your bones and putting flame to the exposed flesh underneath. Your teeth will be pulled, one at a time, slowly, deliberately, each one placed in front of you like spoils of war. Next, your tongue will be severed and mouth sewn shut, so your false words don’t spill into listening ears.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well yeah. It’s where all the records to the city are held. Last thing the government wants is stuff like that getting destroyed. I put the protection wards up myself when Ludmilla requested it months ago. Why do you think the building is still more or less intact?” <EOS>
<BOS> "As you wish." Murmers pass through the crowd, and you gather as you are escorted out that this is a matter of some rivalry among the ladies - to be awarded a hairpin is to have her favor, at least temporarily. <EOS>
<BOS> “You presume much for a petty criminal.” <EOS>
<BOS> At this point you try to go into the benefits of uniting, but barely anyone is listening. Even the ones that are more receptive have their issues. <EOS>
<BOS> A couple of the Dornan acolytes are cut down as they were caught completely off guard by this, however your own attack has proven ineffective against Heather who apparently had a protective spell up just in case you decided to betray her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I’m not convinced and I don’t think most of us are either. I mean if you got the balls to go take him out yourself, then I’ll be the first one to sign up afterwards.” <EOS>
<BOS> "It's over in the chest over there." <EOS>
<BOS> Annah hasn’t seen you, but that’s probably because she’s busy picking everyone’s pockets while they’re all distracted and laughing. Or rather she’s trying to, the problem is the dog moves around enough that people are constantly changing the direction of where they’re looking. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright Marco, I guess you and what’s left of your group friends can go take some time or whatever for the next couple days. Don’t go too far though, never know when some extra bodies might be needed.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well do a good job, and you won’t ever have to worry about Bolt ever again. Now go prepare yourselves, or whatever you have to do and meet the crew in the sewers tomorrow morning at this location.” Rook says pointing at the map. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re not a virtuous person and you most likely never will be, but never let it be said that you’re all bad. <EOS>
<BOS> Your father managed to save Annah's life and with her statement and a few others who saw everything reluctantly stepped up to tell the truth, your actions were considered a justified crime of passion rather than outright murder. <EOS>
<BOS> You return to work and later you see Zalmora and Vaughn. <EOS>
<BOS> “He hasn’t been gone THAT long. I figured maybe he had a special delivery or deal to take care of elsewhere. If he’s gone for much longer I guess one of the associates can go look for him.” <EOS>
<BOS> “There’s where they camp. It’s not too far from the road, but they’re a lot closer than I’d like them to be,” Richard says holding a branch down for you to see. You count maybe twenty tents set up in a circle. White and gold armored sentries patrol the outskirts around the structures. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh come on, don’t be like that. You knew what you were getting into when you entered this carriage.” Graham remarks and tries to touch your leg again. <EOS>
<BOS> Sneaks slaps you upside the head. <EOS>
<BOS> “Nobody stays at the Cozy Krak Inn, or rather no right thinking Hessla native does, unless they want to be taken as a fucking slave. Fucking clueless visitors.” Metzger laughs. <EOS>
<BOS> “It doesn’t, but it keeps a balance. You don’t think they don’t do the same thing? Try to manipulate the law in their favor? The only reason why the Holgard Watch doesn’t mess with either side much is because they’re taking bribes from both sides. They got best racket in this city. They practically never even have to do their fucking jobs! Garrick HOPES that one day he’ll be able to manipulate the right people that will cripple the EC, but I can say right now, he’s doomed to failure, because at his core, he’s too fucking nice. Bribery only gets you so far. To do what he wants to do, he’d need to rely more on blackmail and extortion, which isn’t something he’s too fond of getting heavily into.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey lads, we got some survivors! An’ one of dem is a lovely lookin’ young thing! If nothing else, we’re gonna have some fun tonight! Hey you! Don’t fuckin’ move or I’ll put a bolt in yer ‘ed!” a bandit says before warning you directly. <EOS>
<BOS> No sooner has this runner given you this information when a loud explosion is heard along with a visible black cloud in the distance of the city, you surmise that Marco’s merchant ship that was also full of explosives was set off in the harbor. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t give a shit about the slaves. I want this territory! This whole fucking area and eventually the city. I’m putting together a new underworld organization to be a real force in Holgard again and this would be a good spot for the main base of operations.” <EOS>
<BOS> Zamed’s eyes widen and he goes for his weapon. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, right on time. Always a good sign when someone is punctual. When I noticed the shadow blades come in here, I thought for a moment you were using some sort of weak psychological intimidation tactic and try to make me sweat while you came in late. Though I suppose you’re just more concerned with security given your green buddies over there. Hobs are an unusual choice though. We usually use ogres or orcs, but then you use the savages you got access to right? I can appreciate a man who improvises. In any case, my name is Percy and I’m sure you want to get to it.” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s not unreasonable, but it’s not exactly something you’d be looking forward to paying every month. Especially when you’re already kicking bribes to the Holgard government. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, the Hell’s Own Inn might be good for the likes of you. Despite its name, it’s fairly safe. Sort of neutral ground too, so youz won’t be stompin’ around in someone’s territory.” <EOS>
<BOS> Year 31 <EOS>
<BOS> The troublemaker’s eyes widen and he goes for his own flintlock, but he’s too slow of course and you’ve already killed him and three others before everyone has taken cover. Nobody else is returning fire or attempting to attack, which means you’ve probably asserted your dominance once again. <EOS>
<BOS> “So what happens if I say no?” Marco asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m in a safe place, don’t worry, I’ll meet with you person when there is need to do so. In the meantime, I think this is one of the best ways for us to communicate don’t you think?” <EOS>
<BOS> The new leader Dusk doesn’t even renew contact with you and instead the temple returns to an isolationist mindset, keeping to themselves. You guess you’ve lost the Felians as an ally, but you’re not quite concerned about that given how low their numbers are. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe I am, but I’m also still not entirely convinced of the upkeep costs being low. I mean if we’re going to go into this, I would prefer our slaves to be known as being good quality and not half starving and dirty.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, is this asshole really going to make me run? Fuck this.” one of them says. <EOS>
<BOS> Warts nods and leaves with his spawn who sticks his tongue at you. <EOS>
<BOS> Your last thoughts are how it’s an ignoble death to die like some animal out in the middle of the woods, but it’s a lot better than continuing to be in pain. You wish you had done a lot of things differently in your life, but it’s too late for that now. <EOS>
<BOS> Richard sits to your left, his hand wrapped around a small cup of tea. He finishes the final gulp and refills the cup. “I’d been tracking the Empire’s movements for days. Had to make sure they didn’t venture too close to this place. I recognized Aeric’s men at once. The crimson robe, the one only close members of Aeric’s soldiers wear. Took down a few of them and extracted Seth in the confusion.” <EOS>
<BOS> The staff of power rolls to you over the ground, finding a place in your fingers again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, you’re the leader of the infamous League? Um, we’re sorry we didn’t mean anything!” Gwen says. <EOS>
<BOS> “You always did know me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Only what is necessary. While I mourn for our friends, everything has led up to this moment. I will use all available tools to defeat the Empire, even one made from its own hand.” <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s right little lamb, you’re going to stay right here and…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay! There’s nobody else! I barely even trusted these fuckers enough to follow me with this plan.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit. I mean after all your talk about not wanting to sacrifice some unsuspecting girl, you pick her? A woman that obviously loves you?” <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t really interested in all that though; you just hope you won’t have to pay some outrageous price for Olaf’s services. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh? Well I’m sure she’ll appreciate someone taking longer than two minutes for a change.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Cut the shit. You’re here to steal my son. You know about him and you’re here to take him to back to your main temple. Not happening.” <EOS>
<BOS> “By the gods…no girl. There’s no cock sucking involved. I just want to know more about why you’re even interested in doing this.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Bah, nobody gets lost like they used to. Dat Baroness has mades effort to chop a lotta trees in da surrounding area and make a road as opposed to the simple dirt path it once had.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Because, you’re not just a mere rogue. You’re a killer. You could even be an assassin if you wanted to be. Granted you’re not exactly subtle what with your love of firearms, but sometimes that isn’t important. The Thieves Guild is limited. The Ebony Claw? WE are everywhere! You have the potential to really rise up in ranks. You want money? Infamy? Power? It’s all available if you’re smart and skilled enough.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What does it look like?” she asks <EOS>
<BOS> You drop off a handful of silver at the counter to pay, then head back out into the sunlight and head for the center part of the city. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh what the fuck, did you kill him?” your father asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah? Well that’s probably because you lot weren’t talking about imprisoning my girlfriend before and having me play a role in that! How would you like it if you had to be part of a magic ritual you didn’t want any part in?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I perform the ritual myself. You are right, my prince. I take part in rituals of dark magic at the command of the King, your father. Care to see the proof for yourself?” <EOS>
<BOS> There is also the fact that you have no idea if Flynn’s spell is going to keep her imprisoned forever or if it’s even going to work. If you go ripping Tanya from wherever she is into a magical prison, you can bet that you’re going to be right near the top of her shit list if she ever escapes and you don’t fancy your chances if Flynn turns out to be no match for her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck you. We’re not joining.” Marco says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, suppose that was good thinkin’ on yer part. Guess you do deserve most of the loot.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I see. His sudden attacks make a lot more sense now, though if he had come to me directly, we probably could have even come to an agreement.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Fuck it, we're law abiding citizens concerned with the criminal element in this city. There's no reason we should risk our lives, let the militia do their job. Go talk to your boyfriend." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You tell this woman your father’s name and she instantly lights up. <EOS>
<BOS> Before you can head for his ship, however, a seedy man with an oily apron gestures you towards his less-than-seaworthy looking boat. "If you're looking for passage on the cheap," he says, "Captain Brost could use a couple more people below deck on the Current Asset. Even scrawny ones like you." He spits. "Free passage, and you might even get a bit of coin." <EOS>
<BOS> “Klint, last chance to get that knife out of my face.” <EOS>
<BOS> You find that despite being dressed in your lower class clothing, nobody is really giving you a second glance. It might be due to your youth though; you probably just look like a struggling student. Wasn’t like your dad was exactly rich when he attended this place either. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe you feeble charm works on whores, but you’ll find that I’m unimpressed by such attempts.” She says dismissively. <EOS>
<BOS> “No! You’ve been bossing us about for months getting prepared for this fucking invasion and none of us see why we should even be involved. You do this ALL the damn time, dragging us into these unnecessary conflicts instead of just staying the fuck out of it. You did this with the religious faction war, you did this with the Felians, who were supposed to be our allies and now you’re doing it here. And who is on the losing end of all of this shit? US! That’s who! We’re the ones fucking dying! Well no fucking more! We’re all staying down here and riding this out, and if you don’t like it, tough shit, because if you haven’t noticed by now, you’re fresh outta friends and you don’t even have your filthy hob scum to protect your ass anymore.” <EOS>
<BOS> With all the undead now a pile of splattered bodies on the street (Well most of them anyway) and no longer a threat, Heather pulls you forward and gently places you back on the rooftop where upon you walk over to her. <EOS>
<BOS> “I…um… know who you are sir, and um, there’s no charge.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I need your help on a job.” She says. <EOS>
<BOS> You make for the merchant's main guild building. Unlike most of the city, commerce never sleeps. There you are directed to the only resident jeweler who can appraise your find. <EOS>
<BOS> Apparently Kol’s medallion has been coming off in the middle the night and for the past week Fel has been speaking to Kol. Not to a great extent, but he’s definitely been visiting your son and remarking about how great shadow magic is compared to all other forms of magic. He’s also been trying to convince Kol of keeping the medallion off as soon as he goes to sleep. <EOS>
<BOS> “No! That’s not what you should do!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “Is that what I’m being called now?” you respond. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, there’s better way to get in and out of the city. We’re going through a secret tunnel.” Tom remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Who’s this asshole?” one of the nearby members asks stirring from his hang over. <EOS>
<BOS> “Did I assign you and Tanya to work together? No I didn’t.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m just going to go talk with her.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> After going over some more details, you tell Vera to gather up a crew and start setting things up. It isn’t what she exactly envisioned she’d be doing, but then she’s not running things. <EOS>
<BOS> "You're the boss, but I thought you'd want to go get divorced as quick as possible, given how reluctant you were to get married." <EOS>
<BOS> You grab a box of qweepas who are squeaking their heads off and get out as quickly as you can. You then head to the carriage station where you fortunately don’t have to wait long for a carriage to Klyton. You have to share it with some young couple who must have just got married or something because the two are so into each other you think they’re going to have sex right in there in the carriage. <EOS>
<BOS> "Vaughn you know damn well that isn't going to work. That fucker will just see that as weakness and start demanding payment on a weekly basis. Besides, we're already going to be losing money in the near future, I'm not parting with any more than I have to." <EOS>
<BOS> “I sent them away as soon as they told me you were coming. I didn’t want them to get hurt. It wasn’t their fault after all.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I still don't know why you didn't go with my guy. Relying on Vaughn and his bum miner boyfriend just seems like a bad plan." Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, why?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You return to Rook who is full of praise and goes on about how you’re going to go far in this organization. He tells you he’ll be in contact with you again soon for a more permanent future assignment and even hands you a pouch full of gold. <EOS>
<BOS> This probably would have been the end of you had the hatch not opened back up and corpses crawling out of it. Instead of hitting you, the bolt hits a couple of the corpses instead and you scramble out of the way so as not to get hit by flying body parts heading your way. <EOS>
<BOS> “What da hell? Youz wuz just gonna leave me there?!” he says. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s not a phase though…” Madeline says with a quiver in her voice. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that explains why you bitched at me so much when went up and suddenly squeezed them a couple days ago.” <EOS>
<BOS> She ran away from the orphanage altogether by the time she was nine and lived on the streets until she was around thirteen where upon Garrick caught her trying to pick his pocket. You even describe the type of day it was, mentioning that it was lightly raining. After he caught Tanya he offered her a place in the Guild. <EOS>
<BOS> You half figured you'd at least run into a few idiots trying to rob you on the road, but happily you don’t encounter any problems other than the overly talkative priest of Joachim who is traveling with you thinking that he’s going to bring the light of Joachim to Hessla all by himself. <EOS>
<BOS> You think for a moment. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm afraid I've never been at sea, so I don't think I'd make much of a sailor." <EOS>
<BOS> “There’s just one guy there and he’s smaller than all of us. You really think he’s going to give us trouble? Metzger says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Nah, too far. I’ll probably just find work in Spider Fang territory, open a tradin’ post maybe. Most of da folks dat hated me are dead now anyway so it ain’t like I gotta worry bout bein’ a halfbreed anymore. I should be closer to my family anyway. In fact dat’s another reason youz should go to Jicol. Start a family with Vera, I know you likes her. Forget dat demon girl that’s still plaguin’ yer mind, she’s gone.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You speak as if ally, yet your actions speak otherwise. Who are you?” you say, still suspended in the air. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well we could do that, but the city is only so big. Eventually we’ll have to relocate again. (Sigh) One of the things I didn’t think I’d miss is the spacious sewers of Holgard.” <EOS>
<BOS> By the middle of the year, things are almost back to normal on the island. You’ve still got a lot of extra security around the temple, but restrictions have loosened a bit to the point where you’re not keeping Kol locked up anymore. You still have not heard a single thing about the Syndicate. No threats, no rumors, nothing. Or at least nothing concerning you. <EOS>
<BOS> You have no firearm of any kind, but unlike Annah, you know when to take advantage of a cue. So you immediately reach into your clothing, which causes the Bloody Talons to immediately run from your position like idiots. <EOS>
<BOS> You then hear several people shouting and then nothing at all. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, why?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Caught her trying to escape. She looks harmless, but we don’t need her telling another Imperial battalion we’re here,” he says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah. Never thought MY skills would ever be called into question. That’s good though, means you really are a professional and serious about your work. Look, I’m going to go ahead and tell you what the job is. Kenzer’s Gems and Jewels.” Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, okay, no need for threats, I know you’re a badass. It’s just that I’m finding out that you’re strangely principled in ways that I’m not used to in our line of work. I guess maybe that’s a good thing. Shows you aren’t some complete psycho I suppose.” <EOS>
<BOS> You stumble about the kitchen for a moment before you hear the squeaking and go over to where you figure the qweepas are being kept. <EOS>
<BOS> Ahmed sounds really bitter. Makes you wonder why he’s still here <EOS>
<BOS> “Gert, can you excuse us for a moment?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh good a big dirt room instead of a small one." Zalmora remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah yes, those mostly tie into the Yellow Devil trade. I shudder to think about the hopeless cases that actually pay to fuck YD junkies.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm. Didn’t think you were Claw, but I thought maybe you might be a prospect….hmmm…let me guess did you run into a man going by the name Flynt?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, so we all don't get fucking pinched by the law!" <EOS>
<BOS> “You do a lot of that don’t you?” Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> Marco and his people look a little surprised which just proves how dumb they really are if they thought you were out here alone. <EOS>
<BOS> "So did she do any actual physical damage?" Zalmora asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that’s very forward of you. You didn’t even offer me dinner first.” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “The hell’s that mean? I’ll have you know I got a lot of compliments!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well we could always apply this to our brothel whores too. I mean if a whore doesn’t make enough money for the month then she gets her ass thrown into slavery for slacking off.” <EOS>
<BOS> You must be above the sewers now though this looks like it might be an abandoned building of some sort so far. It barely looks better than the sewers you just left. <EOS>
<BOS> Using your lantern and your natural agility you continue to make your way, hopping that all this hoping and jumping around isn’t going to break the egg in your pack any more than it already is. <EOS>
<BOS> “So, how did it go with Tom?” Zalmora asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, you blew half of his head off. Pretty sure that was Mantis.” <EOS>
<BOS> She doesn’t answer you, she just continues with her actions which are now beginning to get faster and rougher. Her eyes glow red once again and she slams your arms down to the floor. You can feel her talons digging into your flesh. The mixture of pain and pleasure is almost too much to handle. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes.” Zamed answers. <EOS>
<BOS> "Then, welcome aboard." <EOS>
<BOS> Marco slowly gets up holding the side of his face and is helped by a couple others out the room. <EOS>
<BOS> “Where’s she now?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Somebody grab him!” another remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well back when I was working for Elias, we usually nabbed people off the street. Get ‘em drunk at a tavern. Trick ‘em into a dark alley. Y’know like robbing someone except instead of taking just their money, you take them too. Sometimes we bought them off of Hessla pirates and sold them for a higher profit to someone else. I’ll have to get re-connect with my Hessla contacts before we can do that though.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Thanks," he says, as you select a seafood pasta. (Not as expensive as the steak, but not the cheapest dish either. Experience has taught you not to slight those who offer gifts by assuming them misers, nor take undue advantage of their generosity.) <EOS>
<BOS> “Heh, I’ll take your silence as a yes. Though I suppose it’s a good sign that you’re not very forthcoming with that info. Talkers don’t last long in this business. Of course maybe you’re not telling me because you ripped him off…” <EOS>
<BOS> “I want to make sure everything goes right. I can’t just sit around barking orders while getting old and fat. That’s how crime bosses assassinated. I need to keep in practice and my skills sharp.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Wait, were you more worried about me?" Zal asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You envision that it would be possible to have your people sneak in during the night and employ hit and run assassination tactics against the Jicol Watch, and ultimately open the gates to let the rest of your people in. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I’ll take the job.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> The four of them again look down and at each other. <EOS>
<BOS> The way Mr. Reynolds smiles at this point makes you completely tense up. You don’t like whatever he’s about to say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya! You never told me this! Is this true?!” Garrick remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> It doesn’t take you long to find the place; it isn’t even in too bad of an area. When you enter a few people watch you, but don’t say anything. The burly looking innkeeper just asks you what you want and when you say a room for a day, he asks for payment, which you hand to him in exchange for a key. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t think that’s exactly how the royal titles work, but hey you’ve got some of your mother’s blood in you so sure when you start running a few things around here, you can ask to be called whatever crazy royal title you like. Anyway, isn’t it time for your lessons?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit! He’s got…” <EOS>
<BOS> “The prisoner is secure, sergeant.” One of the soldiers says. <EOS>
<BOS> Soon, you stop at a run down little tavern called the Jolly Lobster. (A much happier sounding name than taverns in Holgard that’s for sure) Surprisingly the place is filled with more Delantium soldiers not doing much of anything except enjoying their drink. Among them is a regal looking man who is probably about your age. You’re guessing that’s probably Peter. He doesn’t look quite how you expected. He seems like he would be more than capable in a fight. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh I gave him a much needed day off. He was up all night fighting crime I'm sure you're aware. He even took a bullet or two. Still, nothing serious for a strong young creature like himself. He did leave the proof of his deed, do you want to see?" <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re still here.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> Granted you’ve not seen her in person or even a dream ever since she departed to the infernal realm, but she said she’d always be linked to you. What if every girl you’ve fucked is just making her madder and madder? What if one day she’ll come back to punish your “infidelity”? <EOS>
<BOS> "Sort of thought you'd be a bit happier about this opportunity." <EOS>
<BOS> You half wonder if it’s even her, but the terrible handwriting is unmistakable. You chalk it up to her being perhaps very surprised by everything combined with being busy. In any case you know she’s alive. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, is there anything else we have to do?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Help! I’m being raped!” Vera shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> “No problem, so will you be back next month at this time?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> While Dr. Gossey goes to get your money, you put the box over on a table and just stare at the qweepas squeaking and going about their trapped lives. You then see some of them biting at one with darker fur which is desperately trying to run away and climb out, but can’t due to the attacking qweepas pulling at her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um…well yeah, but I don’t have the money.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> You remain low to the floor in the carriage, occasionally looking out the window. You mostly the orcs circling about on horseback and using their bows to their advantage, though a couple of the novice mages are breaking up that advantage by slinging a few magic missile spells while hiding behind the shield wall that the soldiers have created. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, here’s the deal. When you get sentenced to Dreadcage, find a human there by the name of Ponyride…and don’t you dare laugh at the name. As silly as it might sound you don’t want to know how he acquired it. Just ask any syndicate member where he is and they’ll take you to him if you mention my name. It’ll be real easy to find one of them since a lot of them are there and you just look for the tattoo.” Mr. Scars says and juts out his shoulder. <EOS>
<BOS> You bow, and are escorted to the other side of the room, where several rich ladies accost you and ask if you have any more rare perfumes, how you knew Callius, what storytelling is, and other like questions. <EOS>
<BOS> “Word fumbling aside, he has a point Garrick. They all do. We can’t ignore this potential threat any longer.” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well, there's always the obvious solution." Zal suggests. <EOS>
<BOS> "He certainly went off script for this, but if it's as impressive as you said he's trying to make it, I'll certainly be pleased." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> With that last bit of advice, Warts says he’s heading off to see Snuffit and the two of you part company. <EOS>
<BOS> “STOP! STOP THAT MAN!” one guard shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> “Mm, I mean it certainly was unexpected when I found out. Perhaps less unexpected when he wouldn’t even hear me out, but I can’t say this is out of revenge. I imagine he would be more motivated by revenge than I would, hence why he stuck around to fight. I’d say if anything I’m more motivated by tying up an old loose end that doesn’t come back to bite us in the ass in the future.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What’s your role in all this?” you break the silence along the way. <EOS>
<BOS> After giving Annie a thrill big enough to cause her to actually stop frowning for a moment, you head back to the sewers where you feel a lot less dirty. <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, I wasn’t planning on it…” <EOS>
<BOS> "Listen to my tale," you begin, "and seek the moral hid within." The mage nods along - you were right to think he expected a teaching fable. "Here is the story of the Princess and the Bees." <EOS>
<BOS> “Really? Thought you told me the Spider Fangs shun human civilization centers.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Actually all of you can go in and help yourself to all the Blue Dream you want, but one of you has to come with me and for that to happen, I need the worst of you lot to do something for a lot of coin, so who’s done the most awful thing here?” You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad to see you made it to my daughter’s graduation.” Mr. Reynolds says with a smile. <EOS>
<BOS> The innkeeper takes the silver and gives you a scornful look. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I mean why the fuck are we even being attacked? I mean yeah I get orcs tend to be enthusiastic about their marauding, but something about the fact that OUR businesses are getting attacked like they were military targets seems really fucking suspicious.” <EOS>
<BOS> "If the Empress likes it -" <EOS>
<BOS> You are unfortunately at the far end of the room and while you try to make it to the exit, you just aren't fast enough and you're crushed by large clumps of packed dirt and rocks. You actually manage to dig a few inches through the dirt before you suffocate. <EOS>
<BOS> “But that’s just it, my conversations with the Baroness weren’t about religious faith. They were about magic in general. I was urging that she should seriously consider setting up a magic school here. Especially since I know she’s very interested in the subject.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I apologize," the officer says, "but there has been a mix-up, and all three of you were assigned to the same cabin. We are cleaning the last empty room as we speak." <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, calm down! I was just asking where the medical school is and you’re giving me directions to a statue.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What is it? We’re in the middle of a meeting,” you whisper, backstepping towards her nonchalantly. <EOS>
<BOS> You turn to see Estella, one of the apprentice mages. Her red curls stick out from behind the column. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not to my knowledge. But again, this isn’t a bad thing! This is a good thing! Your son obviously has natural shadow magic ability.” <EOS>
<BOS> "So you going over to his home?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Brother Trevor can lick a slug. Children need their sleep,” Samuel replies. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why the fuck wasn’t I informed soon…” <EOS>
<BOS> You take your original position in the council and notice Seth giving you a look. He doesn’t hold it for long, though, apparently just wanting you to know he’s aware of your absence. You give him a slight shrug in acknowledgement. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, I sent them to go work at the other location when they told me you were coming to talk. I figured we should be alone.” <EOS>
<BOS> For all her faults, Vera’s your best shot at properly rebuilding a new organization again. You probably should have gone with her plans to get into the slave trade rather than listen to Warts in the first place. <EOS>
<BOS> Using your former bosses’ firearms, you take out two EC thugs and then use the remainder of your own bullets to take out three more. A couple of the thugs probably just flat out ran off, so you don’t waste much time and cut off the heads of the two Dreams and shoving them in nearby sack holding a bunch of Blue Dream which you dump out first. <EOS>
<BOS> "And I think you've forgotten that as your wife, it's also partially mine." <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, so you want me to kill him?” <EOS>
<BOS> You arrive at the bottom of the stairs and walk on a little ways further, thinking about what the wizard just said. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wat’s yer problem? I am helpin’! Sides dese valuable bottles, I found out one of the barrels had a hollowish sound. Smashed it open and there was a body inside, idiots didn’t bother looting it and he had some good stuff still on him.” Warts answers and takes another swig from a bottle. <EOS>
<BOS> The words don’t appear. A sickening feeling appears through the rush of power. You feel it deep within your consciousness, yours, not the Unbroken controlling your body. You’ve simply become the vessel in which the dark power lives, a puppet to the Unbroken. <EOS>
<BOS> “He says he wants you to go talk with Jake and making a formal split about there being no hard feelings and such.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> "Come on boss, aren't you going to go after her? You're just mad because you were feeling good about how things are going and in typical Zal fashion she was a bit of a downer. You know that's how she is. I also know Zal and she's just putting on a brave front. She really doesn't want to leave any more than you really want her to leave. It's pretty obvious you value her advice, even if she is difficult at times." <EOS>
<BOS> “Kol, is that the only agent that Fel described to you? Didn’t say anything about an orc?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m…sorry…but this is the way it has to be…I loved you and you abandoned me. We can’t go back to the way things were. (Sniffle) But I do know how to make things right.” <EOS>
<BOS> Travelling the world might be pushing it, but travelling to Holgard is still more than these little shits have done. At this point you begin lecturing Marco about how their criminal activity is petty and amateur along with bringing unnecessary heat down by the Jicol Watch. <EOS>
<BOS> “An enemy with nothing to lose is more dangerous than an overconfident one,” you say wiping the blood from your sword. <EOS>
<BOS> A large stone hurtles towards the planet. You can feel the fear of the people across the world. Ivani squeezes your hand and kisses you before she leaves, summoned far away to stop it. But it doesn't stop. It hits, causing blood and fire to rain down and kill every green thing. The few who survive are changed beyond recognition. <EOS>
<BOS> After another four days of stomach-churning work, you finally stand above deck with your pack and staff, ready to depart. True to the captain's words, a Master Mage comes over to perform the binding geas which will keep you from speaking of Captain Brost, his ship, any of their crimes, or any details of the voyage. But Captain Brost himself comes over as well, to watch the spell, then hands you a large pouch. <EOS>
<BOS> “So what’s all in this for you again?” <EOS>
<BOS> Your shouting caused the escaped demons that you thought left the area to come back for seconds on another easy target. You hear the growls and turn around just in time for one of them to almost be on you. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera reluctantly agrees to your plan, though she says she’d prefer to just ambush the pair of them. <EOS>
<BOS> The Grove of Muses is also a riot of color, but a place of sorrow as well. You can see the muses, or the husks that are left of them, standing like statues - all save Sandman, who turned to dust. <EOS>
<BOS> “Didn’t expect you to. Just wanted you to remember that I saved your ass.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, but again, I’m still not sure if everything there is okay.” <EOS>
<BOS> While Vera has said that Peter has wizard connections as well, that’s not a sure thing that you can get help from them. They’re assisting Peter and have no reason to do the same for you. <EOS>
<BOS> You end up spending most of your days in the sewers jumping at shadows and armed all the time. You barely sleep and when you do, you still wear heavy armor that you invested in after Vaughn and Zalmora first disappeared. <EOS>
<BOS> “Itz from a unicorn ain’t it? Itz magic trust me. Witch doctors grind dem up and make inta potions dat make yer dick HARD. Youz can last fer hours let me tell ya. One time wit Snuffit, I…” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re more optimistic than me then.” <EOS>
<BOS> In a monastery deep in the mountains, Brother Samuel mulls over the scattered parchments on his desk. The lone candle in the center offers little light, but Samuel is used to reading in such circumstances. The mug of mead helps with eye-strain, at least that’s what he told himself. Earlier in life Samuel might have complained at the project in front of him, but with age comes a sense of responsibility along with a greater appreciation for tasks that didn’t stress his aching joints. <EOS>
<BOS> Properly getting with Vera and relocating is the best decision you could have made you think. You definitely feel more at ease and not as stressed out all the time. And more importantly you’ve finally shaken off the effects of whatever it was that was fucking with your head before. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera takes your arm and the pair of you walk to your home. <EOS>
<BOS> Since attempting to travel in this darkness would be foolish in your condition, you don’t try. You just continue to try to get some more rest and hope you can find your way back to some sort of civilization at this point because you still really hate the wilderness. <EOS>
<BOS> You and your sister look at each other in silence for a moment, knowing that some bonds never die. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I’m fine! Get your hands off me! And I could have taken him without your help you know.” Tanya exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well Elana. It might be shitty and run down, but at least you know you aren’t going to run into slavers here.” You say to your new pet. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya however isn’t responsive; she just approaches in a seductive way that is making it very hard for you to focus on anything else except the obvious. Tanya moves closer to you and runs her fingers through your hair and then lifts your head up with one hand and puts another hand to her lips in a “shhhhh” motion. It’s apparent she’s toying with you like a cat would with a mouse. <EOS>
<BOS> “Dad, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you or mom. I’ll make sure the medallion is around my neck good.” Kol says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Have no idea. I can’t know the mind of a god. For all we know he could be lying about everything.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why do you want to know?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> This Ardan could easily pass for your dad if your dad was more muscular and taller. You’ve also been yelled at your father enough that the voice is even similar. Ardan has to be an ancestor of yours! What the hell are the chances? Yag must have flipped the coin on the edge for you this time. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora senses your concern and later that night you try to find reassurance and comfort in her embrace. It helps. <EOS>
<BOS> On the second day of one these food trips, one of the local food merchants who doesn’t normally make much small talk, breaks that habit when you’re looking over the fruit cart. <EOS>
<BOS> “Nothing, just going to get some food.” you reply. <EOS>
<BOS> “He was always was focused on his goal of becoming a doctor. Heard even when he ran his dad’s inn temporarily he did nothing but work hard all the time while still attending his classes. Yep, your dad certainly had his shit together by thinking about his long term future.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Upstairs, last room on the left. Best one in the establishment. You’re out of here by morning.” He says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Goblins? Seriously?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera touches you hand. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t even bother to make the pretense and pull your pistol immediately and point it at Percy. Percy doesn’t seem bothered though and even puts his hand on Toz to keep him from attacking. <EOS>
<BOS> “Pet…okay, you know what. I’m sick of this. We can sit here all night and verbally kick each other in the balls, but the point is, I wanted to speak with you about a mutual enemy, which are those fanatical Joachimites. Now they haven’t been a direct threat to me and mine yet, but I imagine when they finally are through with you, we’ll be next in their purity crusade. Since I’d rather not have to deal with them by myself, I reached out to you for a possible alliance. I figured since you once had a similar set up with the Ebony Claw Syndicate, you wouldn’t be opposed to the idea.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yep, it’s me. I actually worried that you MIGHT recognize me and it would break your illusion, glad that it didn’t.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I know you spoke to me about this before, but I’m not convinced having a slave looking after our son is the best idea.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Then you don’t really know nuthin’ then do ya?” Warts says in a perturbed tone. <EOS>
<BOS> You and Tanya can’t go in any direction without facing ECS members, but given the state you’re in right now, you’re not exactly avoiding a fight and neither is Tanya. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tomorrow night, be prepared to go on a job with a Guild member. A REAL Guild member. He will meet you here and from there we’ll see if we need to waste anymore time with you.” She says. <EOS>
<BOS> “I feel like I should be able to soon. When I do leave, you’ll probably experience a bit of a longing, but I think it shouldn’t be too crippling. The further away I am from you physically the better you’ll be able to get over it and move on.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, I'll get right on that." You say and walk off. <EOS>
<BOS> "I don't get it. Why would a Joachim fearing woman buy a tavern, let alone let her children run it in the first place?" <EOS>
<BOS> Scales briefly looks down at the egg pieces and then back to you. His head turns a bit as if he’s studying you, then his grip on your hands releases, allowing you to slowly pull them back towards your body. <EOS>
<BOS> “I told you this was going to happen!” Vera shouts, as she’s running along side you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright, come on let’s go.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I got my own shit to do before this meeting. Later.” <EOS>
<BOS> You insist on Kol being kept locked up in his room at all times. Vera isn’t sure if that’s the best idea, but she doesn’t have a better one. She’s mainly just as frustrated about this situation as you are and you’re both lashing out at each other a lot. <EOS>
<BOS> “Once you’re in this game, you don’t easily get out like you’re proposing, but I don’t think you’re leaving anyway. The Syndicate is well aware that you have part of your organization on Jicol. We thought about expanding there ourselves on occasion.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve never been to the carriage station before, but it’s mostly empty right now. Still, it’s well lit and there are a few militiamen stomping around. You never thought you’d be happy about that! <EOS>
<BOS> “If you’re just bumping into them accidentally, then you’re lucky because I know by their personalized threats they’re specifically targeting me.” You add. <EOS>
<BOS> You were hoping to avoid getting involved and you certainly didn’t anticipate the Joachimites being so violently fanatical as they’ve been. Then again nobody really did. <EOS>
<BOS> The best leaders are those who do not strive for power. They have nothing to prove. They only do as they must. <EOS>
<BOS> “Is that right? I had heard that rumor a few months ago.” <EOS>
<BOS> “The Crimson Talons. By the gods kid, surely you’ve heard of us. I know your dad didn’t exactly hang out with outlaws, but the Talons were pretty infamous in Klyton! Used to maintain control over all criminal activity in the city!” Tom remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Annie's frown somehow manages to turn even further downward as she just stares at you. <EOS>
<BOS> "Is such a thing possible?" Pelliandra laughed, raising the chest out of the ground so they could look at the jewels and gold. "I suppose you may all take a prize, then." <EOS>
<BOS> Brokolis grabs him, and the few remaining mages in the room jump through the portal. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you return back to your sewer headquarters and spend some time on inner contemplation. <EOS>
<BOS> While you have no idea who this man's name is, you know he has to be an ex-Talon. Probably some young recruit that you never really paid attention to, which is probably why you never recognized him right away either, even if he does look like a vagrant now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that was interesting.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You have no idea when or why Annah was following you, but you’re glad she did. (And a testament to her stealth skills again, because you never even knew she was) <EOS>
<BOS> “Rest up then,” you say. “You can fill me in when you next wake.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ll do whatever you want to do then, look I don’t care! I just really gotta go to this thing!” <EOS>
<BOS> You pull out a solid black orb causing Gloom’s eyes to widen. He remembers a similar magic object was used during the final battle with the Joachimites. You continue to speak quickly before Gloom makes any rash moves. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t turn around. Alley. Now.” A familiar voice says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yep, just one of the many changes that were needed for Kol’s future well being. That one was probably the most fun though.” <EOS>
<BOS> Well that’s the ideal plan anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> “Me? That’s absurd.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m just laying down.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I want to know, as well." Frollig sighs, chewing on the last of his steak while he thinks. "I've learned of a training passage that runs from the Academy to the forest. I'd planned to check it out in a month or two, see if I could learn anything myself. That was before they forbid entering the Grove. I'd be expelled if I went there, and I just enrolled!" <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m sure he did and I don’t care. I’m sure you can make up your own mind about me. I’m off.” <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t believe your ancestor is THIS much of a stubborn asshole. Or rather you can, but you’re almost starting to feel sorry for your great grandmother many times over if this is the guy she’s going to have to continue sleeping with so you eventually exist. <EOS>
<BOS> “This the one Mantis mentioned. Quick, let’s finish him off.” One says. <EOS>
<BOS> You’ll be looking forward to her thoughts on this matter since while things haven’t gone to complete shit yet, you get the impression it won’t be long. <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera? Didn’t expect you to come here so soon.” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> Help directly <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh come on! I was a friend of your father’s! Surely he’s mentioned all the fond memories of us playing smash sphere after school.” <EOS>
<BOS> “As for you, make yourself useful and dispose of Lloyd’s body, I don’t care what you do with it, just get it out of my office.” Rook orders. <EOS>
<BOS> You aren't sure returning to the mage caravan will be any safer, so you decide to take your chances and remain at the Sand Rat Inn. <EOS>
<BOS> “I told you, you didn’t. Those were all accidents or coincidences, not a fucking curse!” <EOS>
<BOS> Shade doesn’t look convinced, but he reluctantly agrees with your plan. <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, Peter’s invasion is probably going to be sabotaged again by the Syndicate since they’re going to want to protect their business here. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, well why don’t I at least help you with that?” Vera suddenly says. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s actually not too complex, but you’re not surprised Annah couldn’t get it open. She never was adept at it, hence why she’s gotten you in the first place. <EOS>
<BOS> The mages have complete control here. It seems the council of mages are one branch of a two-prong government, the other being a royal figurehed. According to rumor, the king is content so long as his treasury, table, and bed are full, and leaves most decisions to the mages, his appointed advisors. <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re accepting a few of these free gifts, a couple of soldiers approach saying that you’re the one they’ve been hearing about and how the magistrate wants to see you about the orc found near the village since a few people have expressed concern to him about it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, you tellin’ me that Annah didn’t accuse me of rape?” <EOS>
<BOS> “She better be as smart as you say. I don’t want to find out she doesn’t know what the fuck she’s doing.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t make it out either. A spell freezes you in place and while you helplessly watch others escape or die in front of you, you can only imagine what grim fate Heather has in store for you after this is over. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck! Infernal!” you shout and before you can even get your pistol out, Ahmed’s already cast a spell that’s frozen you in place. <EOS>
<BOS> At least you think you are. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah! My boss suddenly got the scoop in the middle of the night! Anonymous tip or something. Anyway, the details are inside!" <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, yes I was planning on sticking around a little while. Why?” <EOS>
<BOS> “So are we ready to go?” the driver asks you. <EOS>
<BOS> You look around, but there’s nothing in your cell that you find useful, you do notice that there is someone else in the next cell over. They’re sitting in a corner rocking back and forth mumbling. While the person has obviously been through hell and you’ve definitely never seen this person naked before, the face and hair are still recognizable despite some of the fresh wounds. You can hardly believe it. <EOS>
<BOS> Your father managed to save Annah's life and with her statement and a few others who saw everything reluctantly stepped up to tell the truth, your actions were considered a justified crime of passion rather than outright murder. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tough day in the underworld?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I guess. What if Zal refuses though?” <EOS>
<BOS> At this point you wonder if you shouldn’t just try to escape now. The streets are very busy and it would be a lot harder for the soldiers to get around on their horses. If you’re quick enough you might even lose them in an alleyway or something. Of course that doesn’t stop the fact that you’re still shackled and ultimately surrounded by more soldiers than ever, but maybe you can figure that dilemma out later. <EOS>
<BOS> While there wasn’t a ceremony of any kind, you suddenly get the very real impression that you’re married now. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora continues <EOS>
<BOS> “Boss! I’m not the enemy! Honest!” she quickly says as Vera grabs your shoulder to stop you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I mean you’ve explained the pros and cons of everything and I more or less agree with everything, including not being sure of what the best approach is.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Pfft. Wat kinda thief are ya?” <EOS>
<BOS> concerned, even if you find out that you’re wrong and she gets pissed about you even accusing her and never speaks to you ever again, you’re still going to feel better about all this. You’re going to find out one way or another after she gets off that ship. <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t believe this. This is exactly what you were working to avoid at the Laughing Devil and you get caught up in a raid upon your return here! <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey! Wake up! We have to get a move on! (Sigh) I told Dr. Gossey I didn’t need an escort.” You hear a voice exclaim while some hands shove your shoulders a few times. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, I hope not. I’ve been standing around like a dumb ass if that’s the case.” You mutter and rush back down to street level again. You open the gate (which the guards helpfully left unlocked) and go to the front door which you lockpick with ease. You’d think even with the guards he would have gotten a better lock, but whatever makes your task easier. <EOS>
<BOS> Klint tries to defend himself, but you’re relentless. Klint falls backwards as you attack and ignoring any sort of pain he’s caused with his fists or feet you begin stabbing him in the chest like a madman. Klint screams are now ones of pleading rather than anger. <EOS>
<BOS> In fact as the bullets fail to hurt her, she just turns her head and looks at you with a minor head shake. <EOS>
<BOS> “I want out, and I’m willing to give up Holgard to the Syndicate completely in order to get out.” <EOS>
<BOS> Throwing the crown into the bushes you limp away and eventually find your way out of the park. (Or what you assume was a park anyway) <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose that’s true. Okay! I’ll play The Laughing Elf and his Talking Unicorn.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m still trying to wrap my head around all this. Hell, I can’t even believe David’s dead, let alone the boss. (Sigh) Damn idiot. Still…I’m gonna miss him.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I…I fucked the elf in the ass.” Hank whispers, with his eyes darting around making sure nobody else is listening. <EOS>
<BOS> Gloom also hasn’t really ever given you any reason to suddenly turn on him. Unless you’re going to count the fact that his people never said they were waging a private war to finish off the Dornans. Then again, maybe Gloom considered it an internal matter and didn’t feel the need to bother you with it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well I can see you’re really glad that I am. Why the fuck are you assholes sitting around playing cards, you do realize there is a siege going on and our businesses are getting all fucked up right?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ll be sure to give her your description as well and insist that she not leave until she finds you.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh dear husband! Can I speak with you for a moment?" You hear Zal shout in a sing song voice from upstairs. You hate it when she does that, because it usually means she's going to scold you or give you some unwanted advice and you really don't have time for that right now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Die, Imperial dog!” a man shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> Percy sits back with a intrigued look on his face. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fine. I did it on purpose. I thought it’d be funny.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m talking a new organization. I mean this revolution is going to be over eventually and frankly after everything that’s gone on, I’m not seeing a good reason to even stay with the Ebony Claw Syndicate anymore.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. Okay I guess. A lot more paranoid, still have nightmares sometimes, but at least I’m still alive and attractive enough to still whore.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Percy.” You say, though you don’t put your weapon away. <EOS>
<BOS> You're not going to be threatened or blackmailed by some superstitious old lady. If she's ready to die, then this makes it all the more easier. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah. Tom’s no leader. He’s just leader because nobody else wants the hassle. Well except maybe Jake, but nobody really wants to follow him either.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Good, good, I want you to tell him, the next time he sees you that I left for Holgard.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit. Okay…look this ain’t got nothin’ to do with you son. So why don’t you put that thing away and…ARGH!” <EOS>
<BOS> Though Madeline actually has told you she has an idea to make a special area for that too since she can easily get the goblin crew to help again. She says she plans to help you out a lot more when she isn’t in school any longer. And graduation for her is coming soon, today in fact. <EOS>
<BOS> “All we want to do is start a new life and family together here. Would you really deny us entry when the only thing we’re guilty of is being young and in love?” She says and then kisses you on the cheek. <EOS>
<BOS> The man that grabbed you relents slightly with his grip. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, that explains a few things, but do you know how this happened exactly? I mean is it just because we’re inhabiting a Fel Temple?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not. I’m doing my own thing because I’m not really into Garrick’s plan in the first place. The Neroth cultists have been targeting me specifically longer than they’ve been fucking with the Guild, so I was going to just go take out Reginald and be done with it.” <EOS>
<BOS> You explain that you’ve always sort of stayed away from the college of magic despite lurking around there a couple times out of curiosity. You say you’ve toyed with the idea pilfering from there before since it never seemed like the place was any better protected than most of the other parts of the university, but you were always a bit paranoid that you’d pick up something that might just give you a fate worse than death. <EOS>
<BOS> “You told it to attack me! And how the hell is this your room, since when are you in college?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I sure hope so, because it’s dangerous out here! Is that dagger the only weapon you got?” <EOS>
<BOS> But there might be another option. The endpapers of Ivani’s Book of Tales are special, as are the blank pages of all books from the time before the Sacrifice of Salvation. Tales written on them do not fade – at least, not right away, and so they are prized by those wealthy enough to afford them. Hence, they’d become known as “Remembrance Paper.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So, not working our turf huh? What the hell you doing breaking into a place we’re protecting? Where’s yer gun at? Oh right, you don’t have one” a man says while searching you and taking away your weapons. <EOS>
<BOS> "Hmm, don't I know it." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well the only other option is to wipe them out then, because I think you know from direct experience that two major criminal organizations in one city tends to lead to a whole lot of conflict.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Once again, glad that this is a joint effort though I don’t think it was necessary to bring as many people with you as you did. The orb is going to nullify all magic and when that happens, those Dornan priests aren’t going to be much match for us.” Gloom says. <EOS>
<BOS> “And you wouldn’t be wrong to think that. Paranoia is good and healthy, but I promise you that this is a real offer. I know you’ll need to think about this though, so I don’t expect you to agree right now. However, if you want some sort of assurance that I’m telling the truth, all hits on you are called off. As of right now unless you’re attacking an EC member and they’re acting in self defense, you will not be targeted.” <EOS>
<BOS> Now inside the main room, you can see that the child, about ten or eleven, is lying in bed with a bowl of soup beside. He regards you with bright eyes. <EOS>
<BOS> What if you’ve changed the future just by being here? <EOS>
<BOS> You also wonder about your sister and if she’s still travelling or settled down. Probably not. She was always more of a wanderer at heart. Whatever she’s doing you hope she’s doing well. <EOS>
<BOS> Madeline turns and sees you as well. She smiles and immediately walks quickly over to you. <EOS>
<BOS> "It's all right," you hear her gentle thoughts in your mind. "I will go to a better place - the Paradise of the One God. But my heart will go with you on your travels. Do not doubt; you are my chosen hero. I will arm you with what little power I have." <EOS>
<BOS> Only time will tell if any of these changes mean shit though. <EOS>
<BOS> “Interesting. Though I thought Jicol was supposed to be pirate free.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sounds like a great start.” <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya nods at your answer, meanwhile Heather is getting impatient. <EOS>
<BOS> Madeline talks a bit more about herself and how she first met Camid in the first place. It was basically a typical “wild night” with some of her other university associates and they came down to the sewers to “live dangerously.” She actually says she didn’t really want to take Yellow Devil in the first place and it was just a stupid dare the first time. She also says that she’s long since known that Camid isn’t giving her the real stuff. In fact she says she’s not even interested in taking it anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> “I find that when I tell people they change their mind. People are so judgmental about that sort of thing.” <EOS>
<BOS> Their cheers keep you up. Late into the night, inebriated shouts following unintelligent laughter fill the air. You sit, kneeling, in a room deep in the servant corridor in attempt to find peace and quiet. You don’t. The city is alive; fires burn in the streets, illuminating the destructive behavior of the men, your men. Even here, in the corner of the keep, the night breeze carries their drunken cries, partially mixed with smoke from the fires. <EOS>
<BOS> When you both get past the city gates and far enough away, you finally say something. <EOS>
<BOS> You can see this is a losing battle and you’re tired so you decide to bow out. <EOS>
<BOS> You then explain that she recently discovered that it can be lifted only by performing a ritual that involves an act of intimacy with one that loves you. <EOS>
<BOS> “You command ME? Have you grown so arrogant in your meager mortal life that you believe you can even do that?” Tanya asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “The difference is we’re supposed to be at least somewhat discreet.” <EOS>
<BOS> You manage to just get out of your backyard when you hear someone else shout that they see you and you’re soon off and running from a mob again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Perhaps not, but she talks about you constantly. Always goes on about how great you are. The way I see it, if you were so great then why the hell did she betray you?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Cause the boss said so that’s why! You know there are savage greenskins that live in this forest. We’re supposed to make sure none of them get too close to the main cam…I knew it. I knew I heard something! Snoring! And it’s coming from over there!” <EOS>
<BOS> It was founded by a noble from the Delantium Kingdom. Originally it was most likely supposed to be some sort of outpost or colony for the DK. But whatever the original intent, the noble soon set himself up as absolute ruler with no ties to the kingdom at all. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya doesn’t wait any longer, she runs into the room with all the wine barrels and you follow as close as possible. You’d suggest looking for the passage to the sewers for a quicker exit, but you aren’t even sure if it exists anymore, besides she’s already made her way up the stairs to the ground floor. <EOS>
<BOS> “No,” the Unbroken speaks. <EOS>
<BOS> When you hear the throes of ecstasy, that’s when you make your move and quickly nip out of Annah’s room, past Jenny’s room and soon out the front door, with nobody the wiser. <EOS>
<BOS> "Good-bye to you all," you murmur at the creatures of paradise that flit and dive around you. This place, this secret idyllic corner of nature, was the final dream of your wife before she was lost. You were meant to have shared it together - her, the Muse of Epics, and you, the simple storyteller she fell in love with. Instead, you had tended it for four decades, alone, with only her memory beside you. And now, even that is fading. <EOS>
<BOS> “Child, what are you doing? It’s the middle of the night,” Samuel asks. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm not mucking about in the sewers. Those days are over." Zal huffs. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re silent for a moment. You knew that’s where this was heading, but hearing it makes it real. <EOS>
<BOS> You also tell them that if the opportunity presents itself and it isn’t going to cause a lot of problems, to capture a few pretty ladies as well. You may not be the smooth talker or have the expertise that Vera has, but you know pretty females are always in demand somewhere and they should give Vera a good start on this venture. <EOS>
<BOS> "Enter." <EOS>
<BOS> You shoot one of the bandits in the back before anyone knows what’s going on. He falls to the ground screaming out in pain. He isn’t dead yet, but he might as well be. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little envious that you’ve managed to have it a lot easier than me so quickly, but yes, I’d rather see you doing well than as I said before laying dead somewhere. I mean…yeah I guess I was an asshole that night I threw you out, but fuck you can’t deny that you didn’t play some part in compelling me to it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t just stand there, get his ass!” the sergeant exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> “You can’t do that! You’ll die!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Last year, I was still a bit more optimistic about my choice in joining the guild.” <EOS>
<BOS> The night of the attack comes and you meet with Gloom just a few blocks away from the Dornan Temple, you have your usual hob retinue with you. (You’re really getting used to having these guys around nowadays) Gloom is with a few of his own people, but even without magic powers you can sense some are probably nearby in the shadows. <EOS>
<BOS> She girl laughs. “Ew!” <EOS>
<BOS> “They run the underworld of Holgard, though I think they’re still trying to stamp out a few other lingering organizations. They don’t much care for freelancer types either. I guess you could try to join them, but don’t ask me how, I’m not familiar with their initiation practices.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well she was a bit special for awhile, but as you might know my heart always really belonged to Tanya. I knew Naji was still whoring, and after we got the Nocturnal League set up I made sure she always had a job in one of our brothels, but I never did speak with her again in person. Always thought about it sometimes, but just figured I could get around to it when I wasn’t busy. Guess it’s too late now. Seems rather pointless that I even rescued her given that she just wound up dead anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh? I will, will I?” another voice says before a set of double doors opens up. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah doesn’t stop screaming though and then her dog starts barking again. This causes you to try to shut her up by grabbing her, but this just makes things worse as she begins to struggle and hit you while continuing to scream. Then on top of that, her dog bites your leg again. <EOS>
<BOS> “And you believe the ECS about everything? Don’t you think that they might be lying about some of it just to fuck with you? To turn us against each other?” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s a little surprising just how serious Warts takes religion, well as serious as a follower to the God of Luck and Chance can be anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> A few moments later… <EOS>
<BOS> “I thought so. When I was your age I had already killed several men, left home and was travelling the world!” <EOS>
<BOS> “But if the Joachimites win, they’ll be coming for you next and just because they were turned back by your barrier before doesn’t mean they won’t try when they have no more opponents left. Hell, if they become very influential they may even gain the help of the government to kick you out.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmm, maybe not, but I still think we should re-open a slave market. Sex slaves are just too profitable to not get into.” <EOS>
<BOS> Yinen at this point goes over to a small box and pulls a couple ornamental objects out of it. They look like symbols dedicated to Joachim. <EOS>
<BOS> You aren't entirely sure you'll want to return home, but it's good to know - this has been perhaps the most pleasant two weeks of your long journey. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 16 <EOS>
<BOS> “Heeeeeeey! Youngster! You got some coppers fer the (hic!) faith?” Virgil suddenly says as you step into the Welcome Mat. <EOS>
<BOS> “I see. So the orc you were fighting was separated from his fellows. Which means these villagers are jumping to conclusions that there is an imminent attack from orc savages. Glad to hear it, since I doubt if those assholes in the capital would bother sending anyone up here anyway. Very well. You’re dismissed.” The magistrate says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well if it isn’t, you’re just going to have to get over it anyway. Because WE are not happening. I’m not looking for anyone long term and I don’t want it. It’s not who I am. Apologies.” <EOS>
<BOS> You return to Rook who is currently going through a few of Lloyd’s books. Bolt is nowhere to be found, though for all you know he’s around somewhere in the room. <EOS>
<BOS> You sprint out of the room so that Brother Trevor cannot make good on his warning. You’re moving so quickly that you don’t notice the girl in front of you. You both go flying to the floor, and the folded laundry she’s carrying scatters all over the floor. <EOS>
<BOS> You complain quite loudly, which doesn’t frazzle Mr. Reynolds in the least. Tom attempts to calm you down. When that fails, he tells you to go wait outside and he’ll speak to Reynolds in private. Henry glares at you as you leave. As much as you’d like to punch the guy, you know that wouldn’t be a smart move considering what he just did. <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t help but be pretty attracted to that sort of dedication. In fact, if you weren’t still feeling so drained you’d probably have with Vera again right now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, thanks.” <EOS>
<BOS> "You talked to them both?" <EOS>
<BOS> "Touched," some say. <EOS>
<BOS> “She’s fucking annoying and that’s enough. I curse the fact that she’s so naturally talented, so I’m reluctant to do anything worse than just verbally abuse her.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I’m going to take steps to help you clean up the place in that regard. I’ve sort of realized that I started to get lazy and began shitting where I eat. I need to keep my business separate from this place. I’ll try to also get the college crowd back in this place.” <EOS>
<BOS> “House? Look, your father…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Restrain the unbeliever!” <EOS>
<BOS> One of them is very non-descript and oldish looking man, probably not a bad quality to have for blending in with the crowd during a quick getaway actually. The other you can’t tell due to the hood, but judging from the smaller body type with more curves, and long white hair peeking out from the hood they’re probably female. <EOS>
<BOS> “What did you do to her?” you ask as the two men grab your arms and start dragging you out. <EOS>
<BOS> You immediately search the quarters hoping that you can find a weapon of some sort. <EOS>
<BOS> Now that you’re looking at them both, there could very well be a family resemblance. <EOS>
<BOS> “I can hardly wait.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Percy crouches down next to you as you attempt to crawl away. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, nah. Couldn’t keep up that ruse forever and still be officially enrolled here without arousing suspicion. I just live with Jenny now in this small home her parents pretty much paid for.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You in contact with the Felians or the ECS?” <EOS>
<BOS> Predictably he’s a good shot and you’re impaled through the back and out your chest. Your death is instantaneous. <EOS>
<BOS> You leave the trader and head back to where you’ve been currently staying in Hessla. You thought you’d never get a ship to take you to Jicol. Less ships have been coming through Hessla lately thanks to the invasion at Holgard. Also all known pirates have been banned from entering Jicol. You guess that’s why not many ships from here are currently allowed to travel there. <EOS>
<BOS> "The sad thing, is that's the best offer I've had in years." Annie remarks a bit despondently. <EOS>
<BOS> Oddly, he’s ranting about her so much now that it’s almost like he’s angrier at her than he is at you now. A step up you suppose, you figure maybe there might be hope to get out of this without a fight after all. <EOS>
<BOS> Keira looks a bit surprised by all this. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, this one certain does have a tether to the infernal realm and I can certain use such a thing for the upcoming election, though hardly need the entire body, just the heart will do.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So what are you suggesting?” <EOS>
<BOS> “SHIT!” <EOS>
<BOS> “I am grabbing valuables! You realize how much old bottles of wine go fer?” <EOS>
<BOS> You talk about Tanya for quite awhile. Honestly, it’s kind of nice to talk about her as you’ve never done so before. Not even to Warts, even though you know he’s aware about what occurred between you two. Flynn sits and listens very intently, never interrupting and just writing notes on parchment. Heather on the other hand looks like she wants to ask you all sorts of questions and is doing her best to not speak. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, if you want to hire more hobs on the payroll fine. I can see them being an asset in a menial manner, and working outside Holgard on the road robbery jobs is probably the best place for them mainly because I won’t have to deal with the filthy greenskins.” <EOS>
<BOS> Klint charges at you and you dodge out of the way, but your leg doesn’t completely clear the charge and you fall to the ground face first. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit! What the hell man?” she exclaims raising her hands up. <EOS>
<BOS> However, to your left, is where you start to see the construction. You examine the entrance of the dug out tunnel in an attempt to detect any traps but find nothing. <EOS>
<BOS> You figure you’ll ponder your long-term goals after getting something to eat. You take some of your coin and exit your room. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh fuck you, Vera.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, yeah, they’re fighting age to be sure. An’ remember these are hobgoblin children that have been livin’ in da wild all their lives. I guarantee they’ve all probably killed already.” <EOS>
<BOS> A few months pass and you’re making a good amount of coin with this new venture and you can take a little relief that there’s still some things you aren’t going to do even in your position… <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I suppose that makes sense. Didn’t realize there were that many left though. Figured we killed them all by now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh you’re finally back, that must have been a very involved discussion.” Zal remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> You and Zal get back to that task at hand. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re right. It IS a risk, but you’re not doing this alone. The entire Nocturnal League is going to be assaulting the city at the same time you and whoever of your grog swilling buddies you can muster up for this task. As I said, there will be a sizable amount of coin for all of you in addition to whatever plunder you wish from the town itself…well except Elegant Elixirs.” <EOS>
<BOS> You kiss Vera goodbye and say one more thing before leaving. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, what youz doin? You think youz a squirrel or somethin’?” Warts asks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes sir." Rob once again replies without emotion. <EOS>
<BOS> “Form three!” <EOS>
<BOS> You thought the followers of Joachim were supposed to be into purity and restraint. If you didn’t know any better, you’d think Joachim was the god of alcohol and hopeless drunks based on this guy’s behavior and actions. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, for awhile now. But I don’t think its bullshit. For the past month I’ve been having these really dark thoughts and I keep seeing the deaths of those girls and the worst part about all of that is I’m starting to think that I killed them.” <EOS>
<BOS> The hooded woman sits back a bit as if you’ve actually succeeded in making her slightly uncomfortable. <EOS>
<BOS> So after quickly catching a carriage and getting inside in, Annah is true to her word and wastes no time in getting started. <EOS>
<BOS> "She told me she hoped that her mother actually WAS dead, because then she would never get in the way of your love for her." Zal chuckles. <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, we have common interests in some regards. She’s a typical rich kid doing illegal shit every now and then for kicks, but lately she’s been sort of a bitch to live with. Which brings me to my other reason of why I’m doing this. I’m leaving the city so I figured I wouldn’t leave empty handed.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh it’s as legit as they come, it’s just probably not the most ethical. In fact, it’s probably way worse than being a common rogue.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Come to your senses! Can’t you see it’s nothing more than a trick?” you plead. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you disembark and several armored men equipped with muskets and swords meet you and Zamed. <EOS>
<BOS> “What elven bitches are we talking about exactly?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Essentially, yes. Up to you though if you want to take that risk. If you do and assuming you’re successful, I believe on my end we can track down the latest where abouts of the Inquisitor and hit him hard. This brings me to my question to you. Regardless of what approach we go with, what exactly is it that you want of the Temple of Fel in exchange for your assistance in this matter?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno…(Sigh) yeah I suppose it couldn’t hurt, though I’m just wondering about the people we already have alliances with. I mean pissing off the Holgard magic school isn’t something I exactly want to do, also you mentioned the ECS has been thwarting this guy’s efforts for a long time, and I’m still not convinced that they won’t still do that even if they haven’t done it yet. By siding with Peter, we could piss them off which wouldn’t be any good either.” <EOS>
<BOS> A week after you have left Dreaming Village, the Cathedral finally comes into sight, its spires towering over the trees in the valley below. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why do you want to know?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “So convince me.” <EOS>
<BOS> The goddess Pelliandra smiles, "I think he is fascinating! To think a creature we did not choose uncovered our gift with his own cleverness." <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh for fuck’s sake Clyde, calm down and leave the boy alone. Judging by the look of him he’s just a snot nosed kid. Probably ran away from home or something. Hey, kid you got any money on you?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, maybe his recent actions muted your feelings or maybe you’re just dealing with them in another way…um are able to cry? Serious question.” <EOS>
<BOS> You head to Jicol to go meet Marco and the rest. Along the way you think about how history is sort of repeating itself here. A larger criminal organization crushing a smaller one. The only difference is you’re the leader of the larger one this time. <EOS>
<BOS> You interrupt their little spat by managing to turn over and barely sitting yourself up. You manage to fire off your pistol, killing two of them. Gertrude fires and the last one however manage to hit you again just before your last shots bring them both down as well. <EOS>
<BOS> You draw your pistol as you walk over to Sneaks. <EOS>
<BOS> The council members bow to the king and crowd towards the door. Seth makes straight for you, pushing aside an elderly advisor. <EOS>
<BOS> You'll worry about it later; right now you have more immediate if mundane concerns. <EOS>
<BOS> You head to the Temple of Fel which isn’t exactly easy considering there are several riots going on, but eventually you get there. The area of the temple is fairly quiet compared to other parts of the city. Perhaps even the average rebel knows better than to fuck around it. Which makes you question your own sanity of why you’ve insisted on coming here. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit…thank Yag we got outta there when we did.” Warts says catching his breath. <EOS>
<BOS> You ignore Klint’s ramblings and continue to focus on his knife, which is now aiming towards your face, even if you are trying to widen the gap between you two. <EOS>
<BOS> "You mean more to me than a thousand stories." <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah! I know how YOU want to get to know her! Trust me, you aren’t the first to try, and you probably won’t be the last, but so far every guy I’ve seen try has failed. Just walk away. Now get your mind off her ass and back to business.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sheesh, youz been in dis city for a year and you don’t even know the major players! Lord Reginald is some well off guy dat got a title becuz he’s dah Baron’s son’s friend. Hear he’s more than dat though.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m giving it to you because your weak ass magic is already going to be fucked by the Inquisitor so you don’t have anything to lose. Not to mention that between the pair of us, YOU are the close combat expert so you’ll most likely get in closer than I’ll be able to since we still have to fight through all those fanatics. Fucking hell Shade, I’m doing YOU a fucking favor, so stop being a paranoid asshole and take the damn orb in the spirit of our fucking alliance that its being offered!” <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t know, you tell me. A plan of some sort perhaps. I’ll decide if it’s important enough or not.” <EOS>
<BOS> Sometimes, everyone plays a game to pass the time - counting how many different shades of red the sands come in. Crimson, of course. Scarlet. Carmine. Blood. Brick, rose, vermillion, wine, and coral. A dozen other hues, and counting. If someone comes up with a shade that hasn't been mentioned before, as per general group memory and consensus, they get a silver coin from the caravan master. You've earned a handful of those yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> After the battle, you can claim ignorance about the orb and just tell Gloom that she must have been attempting to kill you by giving you a non-working one in the first place. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh like what? You gonna stab and kill me too?” Annah asks while picking up a nearby apple. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, you’re basically paying me to be a courier?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> From behind a tree, a man steps out, silent and stern. The cloak at his back rises high, covering the lower half of his face. “It’s just through here. The forest opens to clearing. The ruins are there. No sign of activity.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You don’t think she’ll be even more pissed at you for NOT telling her and it just suddenly being sprung on her like this?” you blurt out. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I’m sure you have, but its value is not the point, this is my gift to you. The motivation behind it is important.” <EOS>
<BOS> Of course it isn’t just an easy matter of ripping the dagger from the wall, you grab a prybar from your pack and start to get to work, but given their height above you, it’s awkward. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay. Okay. I guess maybe you make a solid point. I’m still really worried about you though.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit changes. Now do what I tell you. Oh and I want their heads as proof.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sounds like a plan ta me.” <EOS>
<BOS> Well Annah always does get right to the point on how she really feels about you. Maybe she’s right, maybe you could use a change of scenery. You’ve certainly saved more than enough to move and live comfortably elsewhere. (You assume Hessla is probably cheaper, if that’s your first destination) <EOS>
<BOS> Since you’re not exactly getting any further with Tanya at the moment, Garrick’s pissed at you and you’re essentially doing your own thing, you might as well stay somewhere other than the Guild while you do this. You head to Hell’s Own Inn since it’s at least some place that you know and can consider hospitable. <EOS>
<BOS> As you fall, you hear Zal’s voice echo your name in darkness until the sound dissipates leaving you only to fall in dark silence. <EOS>
<BOS> A quiet woman standing at the edge of the crowd also catches your eye. You haven’t seen her before; she’s either new to the town or just passing through. Her dress is a simple, but well-tailored, and the quality seems less rough than that of the townfolk. Her eyes are shadowed by the net of a gray veil. In one fist, she clutches a fine embroidered handkerchief, hinting that she has the means to match. Pleasing her might be more lucrative than angling to please the crowd, but her general aura is tragic and closed off. You aren’t sure if you should use your final story in Dreaming Village to win over a stranger, either, rather than please the community you've befriended. <EOS>
<BOS> “Exactly! When they march on our position, we’ll retreat into Yen’s Passage. The narrow road through the hills will force the Empire to lose their numbers advantage. In the meantime, you will take a battalion and lead a firestrike on the capital. They’ll be caught defenseless...well, as defenseless as possible.” <EOS>
<BOS> You weren’t aware Zalmora had any kind of attraction to you before, but it’s definitely apparent now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey paid your price, I’m not giving you another coin!” you remark trying to salvage the situation, but Annah is being uncooperative tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> "Hm, well I wish you well on your new endeavor of running your inn successfully like your family once did and being just an average Klyton citizen...but then you never did officially become a citizen of this great city did you?" <EOS>
<BOS> The man who helped defend Holgard from the Usurper Peter Varsakken. <EOS>
<BOS> “And you think this is one of those times, you don’t think there’s still a chance to turn this around?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> With his mother in danger of losing the inn, the young man had to put his dreams on hold and help his mother. It was a time of great stress for the young man, but in time he was able to not only keep the inn afloat and pay off the debt, but he was also able to turn enough profit to re-enroll at the university and eventually become the doctor he always wanted to be. <EOS>
<BOS> “Grm. So that’s how it is huh? Ol’ Warts gets cheated again. (Sigh) Fine. You got the upper hand, follow me.” Warts says in a resigned tone. <EOS>
<BOS> You have to admit, Flynn is making a pretty sound argument. There have been many times you’d like to “move on” but it’s obvious that you can’t unless you go through with this ritual. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look…” Annah says trying to maintain her composure. <EOS>
<BOS> Without Garrick around there’s no organization whatsoever and most of them attempt to flee rather than fight. Garrick himself is still hidden in Tanya’s room, you drag out his body and shoot it a couple times as “proof” you killed him earlier. You look all over the place for Sneaks, but you don’t find him at all. In fact, when you go to his room, some of his stuff is even gone. You wonder if he sensed something amiss and just quietly left on his own. <EOS>
<BOS> The small crowd share glances and awkward smiles, as if realizing that the strangers they are surrounded by have shared something special with them. Your chest tightens, and you feel something drawn away from you - the words of the story. It will never be told again, by you or anyone else. Only the pale memory of it will remain. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, appreciate you coming to me with this. When the invasion comes, it will be important for us to coordinate.” Heather remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> keeps you distracted from the next. Her foot follows the series of punches, sending you sprawling to the ground. Still balancing with her leg outstretched, the girl, Kassi, laughs at your misfortune. <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose it has.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, let’s go then.” <EOS>
<BOS> You definitely don’t feel bad about it and while that can be due to several understandable factors, you can’t help but wonder if you could do it again under different circumstances. <EOS>
<BOS> The village has been attacked and something is dreadfully wrong with the survivors! <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, so why the hell were you following me? And before you even start, YES I am thankful you did, otherwise Klint’s father probably would have killed me…shit I just realized I’ve killed that entire bloodline now and nearly under the same circumstances. Fucking hell…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, you got a point. Okay.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, how do I know they won’t shoot us, if I win?” <EOS>
<BOS> "So I can leave?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Sir! Stay inside! We’re being attacked!” he shouts <EOS>
<BOS> You and Warts both enter the passage and soon find yourself in a cellar with a bunch of wine barrels. Tons of them. Warts looks like he’s hit a gold mine and immediately starts grabbing wine bottles. <EOS>
<BOS> About the only thing you can do is try to see if Heather and her people might join Peter’s invasion. Hell, if that’s the case then you’d definitely be willing to help Peter as well. <EOS>
<BOS> Madeline’s face gets sad again, it’s obvious she doesn’t want to think about that. Despite the new horns she’s very much still hanging on to most of her human emotions for you. She sits up and starts to sniffle a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe its just humans. I mean I’m still alive and so is yer demon girl.” <EOS>
<BOS> And you can’t forgive it. Even if you are genuinely feeling sorry for Vera right now. <EOS>
<BOS> After wandering a bit more and entertaining the idea of pilfering the palace, you discard your usual procedure of avoiding the crowds and walk towards a room where you hear some music followed by a lot of clapping. <EOS>
<BOS> You aren't sure you can last much longer. The rations in your pack have run out, and the small meals they provide are not enough to sustain you. Life at sea leaves you constantly nauseus as well, both from the motion of the boat and having to deal with blood and guts all day. But what can you do about it? Speak to the captain, again? Try to escape? <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe. I dunno. Yeah, sure I guess.” <EOS>
<BOS> Vaughn at this point just shakes his head. <EOS>
<BOS> “But I’m not even familiar with what’s going on exactly.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, it’s further up the hall.” Another remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Unarmed combat, form mastery, and dueling.” <EOS>
<BOS> Still, there is one person you tell since you figure they deserve to know. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I’m confident that he’ll have at least enough experience to pull this off, since that’s not going to be the hard part anyway, it’s getting off the ship and out of the harbor area alive as soon as he enters it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey lockboy, why’re you so quiet over there?” Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Okay. Guess we can do this here then." <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you complete your tale and Teklis completes whatever it is he was doing. <EOS>
<BOS> “Doubt it. I’ve seen the best liars in action and you aren’t one of them. Your whole story sounds suspicious and given what I already have heard about you, I’m not sure why Rook ever trusted you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah so what’s this all got to do with me?” <EOS>
<BOS> “You were in my room! What the hell was I supposed to think? Look, I just want to know, were you serious when you said you were glad to see I was doing well without you?” <EOS>
<BOS> You always hate how intertwined the Syndicate is with the whole Fel religion. Makes dealing with them always uncertain. Are they interested in profit or are they interested in spreading faith? <EOS>
<BOS> “Damn…well let me at least pay full price, I know the madam said I had a discount, but…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Who Zamed? He’s not my boyfriend, he was just a convenient dick. He’s on his way to meet with Peter anyway so I’m leaving on another ship in a few days. Tried to convince me to do so as well, but I saw no reason for that and even if I did I’d at least bring it to your attention first. I suppose you might be right about all this possibly not even panning out anyway. I probably could even help on that front by convincing some of the pirates I do business with to not join Zamed’s flotilla.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why would I do that?” <EOS>
<BOS> “…thanks? I think?” <EOS>
<BOS> A few months pass and besides hiring more hobs, it’s pretty much business as usual. About a week after the latest visit by the Syndicate rep to pick up their cut, you get a surprising request from the Temple of Fel to meet with you. Apparently Dusk wants to speak about re-establishing an alliance. <EOS>
<BOS> “Annah?” you utter, but she doesn’t answer she just looks down at her wound, holding it and then looks at you with a mixture of shock, pain and sadness. <EOS>
<BOS> The ECS is always a looming threat in the back of your mind. You know there is going to be a reckoning with them soon and it’s probably going to initially come in the form of intimidation first. <EOS>
<BOS> While she hasn’t offered to go, you get the impression Zal might be more inclined to help you if support her idea, but if Zal wants to help she can come with you with you needing to ask her. You’re not going to barter with her or be some pawn just because you’re sleeping together every once in awhile. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, yeah that sounds fine.” You say not really wishing to argue since she’s right about you not being in the best condition right now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya?” you utter. <EOS>
<BOS> “So, Camid tells me you’re an engineering student at the top of your class.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah as friends. You always KNEW I wanted to be more than that and instead of being direct, you just sent me away to a fucking island while you were fucking that wizard chick.” <EOS>
<BOS> A weight is lifted when you hear this news. You were expecting Dusk to tell you something bad, so you have to ask again. <EOS>
<BOS> “During every melee, the King sends a man to scout for warriors. Once a year, one of us is recruited to serve the King.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm. I see. And you’re not going to be there at all?” <EOS>
<BOS> "I see," you murmur, "you have lost your purpose as well. What is next for us, without goal and without love?" You rise, staff in hand. Its power is at your disposal, asking only for a master to guide it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, this has got us nowhere,” Seth answers. <EOS>
<BOS> “No! I mean why did you sacrifice her?” <EOS>
<BOS> You leave the Welcome Mat Inn, though a little more cautiously than usual. Nobody seems to be approaching or giving you suspicious looks though. Still, wishing to keep a low profile, you stick to the back streets as much as possible and eventually when you get to the better part of town, you catch a coach for your remaining trip to the university. By the time you arrive, the day is beginning to end, but you soon find that the university is still fairly active. <EOS>
<BOS> I do not allow it to consume me, though. I’m well aware of the shadow nature within. If left alone, it will be like a spreading wildfire, burning everything in its path. No, I temper it will discipline. My power may be growing, but I control it. It does not control me. It iss the same thing every man experiences, the battle within between good and evil. It’s just amplified within me...and the consequences are much greater. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh he’s doing fine uh Miss…umm…” you reply <EOS>
<BOS> Ludmilla and Vera talk for quite awhile, it’s actually pretty amazing since it’s about absolutely nothing. Or at least nothing you’re much interested in. Ludmilla is mostly talking about herself and the troubles of being of noble birth. Goes on about how Vera’s lucky to not have to worry about such things. <EOS>
<BOS> “Explains why you got caught. You’re not a professional.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not really.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Risks of the trade. I imagine you’d know something of that.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Boss! Boss! Jicol has mounted a counter attack! They’re blasting us with cannons from their ships and we can’t do shit about it!” he says. <EOS>
<BOS> And to your equal surprise: <EOS>
<BOS> Percy looks at his surroundings and with a smile he begins to speak. <EOS>
<BOS> Not to mention repairs on the open sea with only half the crew also take a long damn time. On the plus side, you've learned your way around a ship a lot more, though you fully intend on never using this knowledge again if you can help it. <EOS>
<BOS> “We’ll be seeing a lot more of each other after this.” Vera says and gives you another kiss before her and Gwen leave. <EOS>
<BOS> “Come on let’s go!” Elana shouts from inside the carriage. <EOS>
<BOS> "Your gift is intriguing. I am pleased." One of the guards adds the box with the perfume to the large pile of gifts sitting near the throne. "Tell me, what is your request?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Enough! Is this even remotely true? I got shit to do and I need to know now. So if everyone here wants to get their free drugs, you need to fucking confess or step aside and let someone else earn this coin. I'm not going to judge you anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> He pokes his head out of the tent and looks furtively left and right. "It isn't safe here, either. They offered a reward - many of the merchants will turn it down out of principle, but there are some for whom it will be too easy to trade you for silver. Here - " he tosses you a bundle of colorful fabrics. "Put these on. They will disguise you, enough." <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ve been keeping track of what every main group is doing, don’t flatter yourself.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Elana?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> "You'd think so, except some of my genius crew thought they'd be heroes or something and they started looking over the side and firing their pistol into the water. Yeah, they saw one of those bitches, fell in love and before I know it, they're not only removing the wax from their ears, but they start attacking others and removing their wax or outright killing them. After it was all said and done, half of the crew was dead. Now I gotta recruit all over again and stick to places that have virtually no resistance until strength is built back up. You know what kind of places those are? Places that are poor as shit!" <EOS>
<BOS> “What do you want and what the hell is in the bag?” she asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You immediately head back to the large set of stairs that lead up in the foyer. As you’re heading up the stairs, you notice that the lighting is becoming much darker. It’s almost as if the candles from the chandelier are going out. <EOS>
<BOS> You close your eyes again and manage to get back to sleep. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora turns her attention to you and reminds you that a new shipment of rum will be coming in a few hours and Vaughn will need to help bringing it in. She then kisses you before heading back to the office. <EOS>
<BOS> “That fiend!” you gasp, “He did this to the village! He turned them all into zombies! <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that’s just it, you’re not completely under my spell or influence, but I’m worried that one day you might get that way! I mean I want you to be a freethinking being. There’s so much shit going on and I’m experiencing changes a lot faster than I ever have before. Look!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh… shit. Fuck, this is going to be good.” She says as you enter inside her. <EOS>
<BOS> Ivani is the only one in your eyes. You return to the bench where her husk rests. Her hair is flowing again, and much of her is in color. You kiss her on the temple, her flesh almost warm, and gently pull on her hand. The arm moves, though sluggishly, and you place it near her eyes, brushing the hair away. You press the letter into her palm, where she could read it if her eyes worked, and read the words aloud to her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, do we need to kill her? I mean isn’t she important?” Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Just as you’re starting to lose consciousness, Grayhaze comes out of her store. She sees you and shakes her head. <EOS>
<BOS> "Are we going to have to worry about mermaids?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, I think I might know someone boss. This chick called Madeline. She actually attends Klyton University and she's an engineering student." Camid remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya, wha…what’re you doing?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> "Thank you, that's actually pretty helpful," you say. <EOS>
<BOS> Her facial features are partially fishy in nature, but humanoid enough looking that you fall under the unnatural spell. Now instead of just smelling fish and brine, you taste it as well as she embraces you with a kiss. <EOS>
<BOS> “Elder Flynn, I apologize for my outburst towards you earlier. Out was out of line, but as you can tell my feelings in all this are very intertwined. I can’t easily separate them even if I know it would be rational to do so. I loved and still love Tanya no matter what she’s become. Maybe…maybe I just need more time to think about it, but I cannot bring myself to do this thing. At least not now.” <EOS>
<BOS> While you might just be thinking with your dick right now, you’d still rather have a bit of privacy. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well a good leader tends to have good instincts. If it’s any consolation, I really didn’t want it to go down this way and it’s nothing personal.” Gertrude remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Six months later… <EOS>
<BOS> "What?" Niro gasped, as all around him the soldiers destroyed the eggs. He could feel it, a pain deep inside him, a horror beginning to grow. He held up his own sword, seing himself reflected in the mirrored surface of one egg, ready to strike. But he couldn't do it. <EOS>
<BOS> Yinen finally realizes someone is there with him, but instead of jumping at the chance to be free, he starts screaming. <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, but besides all the other shit going on in my head, I have been thinking about business matters too.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well…it’s your call I suppose boss. I just don’t want us to get swept away in the flood of this upcoming conflict. I want to see us survive.” <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora is certainly pleased about all this and says she knew you’ d be able to convince Tom better than anyone else. <EOS>
<BOS> “Who are they?” <EOS>
<BOS> "So what's the damage with this one?" A Headsman with a couple extra decorations asks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes, I'm fucking serious. I'm sick of your bitching, your sarcasm, your smart ass remarks that attempt to undermine my authority in general. You seem to think because we once shared a bed together that somehow allows you to say anything you want to me. Combine that with the obvious fact that you don't really have the stomach for this business anymore, well there isn't much use for you is there? So with all respect and no ill will, goodbye Zal. You were a valued member of the Crimson Talons while you were part of us, but your services are no longer required." <EOS>
<BOS> With Marco’s shit out of the way, you go about inspecting the latest expansions around the temple, which is now starting to resemble a “town hall” since there are separate buildings popping up all around it. These aren’t just criminal types either opening up brothels or gambling centers. You’ve actually got a some ex-Jicol citizens opening up legitimate businesses since Jicol is on the downturn and they’ve lost their homes and businesses in that city thanks to the flooding disaster that the city STILL hasn’t completely recovered from. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I see and I get it. You saw an opportunity and you were going to take advantage. Well, that opportunity is gone now, and there are enough of us to make this a problematic fight. Killing me won’t bring down the Nocturnal League anyway. My wife is more than able to handle the leadership position and she’s not going to spare any expense in getting revenge. Not to mention, regardless of the outcome, I am more than fast enough to take YOU out. You sure you want to do this?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well of course you did, you’re the boss. They’re hardly going to tell you, you look like shit. Not that you do. You’re fine. I guess we should get going, do you have your mask?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, and I was part of the Syndicate once too. Not for very long, but long enough to remember that you were killing them at one time. Some of those guys were my fucking friends! Okay, maybe not friends, but a couple owed me money which I’ll never fucking get back now!” a third says. <EOS>
<BOS> You say goodbye to Zal and leave the inn. <EOS>
<BOS> “Lost your chance Virgil, get out of my way.” You say and shove him aside causing him to fall. <EOS>
<BOS> Since you have no intention of going quietly, you fight your assailants. It’s hard to see in the dark, but you’re doing the best you can. Eventually you manage to get your arms free and draw your blade. You slash blindly, hitting someone before you try to make your way back downstairs. <EOS>
<BOS> Seeing as you’re not actually soldiers you stick to your plan of just protecting Heather and her students while they do the heavy lifting. <EOS>
<BOS> And with that, Zal and Vaughn leave to let you go speak with Tom. You swear you never thought the day would come where you would be known as the “diplomat.” You guess your sister’s charm rubbed off on you just a little bit. You sometimes wonder how she’s doing. Probably better than you are at any rate. <EOS>
<BOS> "While I'm sure you're having a good time running around abusing your underlings, I'm wondering if it's even necessary." Zal remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah speaking of that, should I be worried about getting stopped by the law?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “I can’t even do that anymore, I feel like I’m cheating on Tanya. I’m telling you, this is really happening. I don’t know how, but it is. I mean don’t succubi invade dreams? I mean maybe she’s trying to tell me something even if she isn’t doing it in the real world.” <EOS>
<BOS> And with those last words your eyes begin to close and you feel the taste of Tanya’s lips on your own before you pass on. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 30 <EOS>
<BOS> “Well how the hell did you think we were going to do that Vaughn? We can’t just let this asshole walk away! That’s what HE did with Jake and the rest! And that’s why he’s a pussy leader. We do the same thing and we’re pussies too!” Camid remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Who are you?" Niro asked, "what sort of man can be born in an egg full of sand?" <EOS>
<BOS> Looks like you know who you'll be voting for in the future. You knew there was going to be a catch, still you suppose it's a small price in the scheme of things. Well at least you hope so. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, not that much. Really all you have to do is provide the bare minimum most of the time.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya, are you listening to yourself? You’re starting to lose control and getting drunk on the chaos. Maybe I should have said something earlier, but you’ve been this way for quite sometime now. I love you and all, but you REALLY need to get a grip. You’re not even thinking strategically anymore.” <EOS>
<BOS> "We were just going to toss him overboard," Captain Brost shrugs, "now that he's served his use. But if you think you can save him, go ahead and try." He hands you a large bag that has very few useful items in it. Most of it seems to be rough cutting tools - some of which are coated in near-fresh blood, but there is some thin wire and a needle in it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t be sorry, just fucking get the baby and let’s…shit he’s not dead!” <EOS>
<BOS> “No argument there. Look kid, I’m not sure what to tell you, except I do hope you stick with us. I don’t care what your reasons are, whether its for safety, or riches or your ongoing failed pursuit of Tanya’s demon pussy. We need more…for the lack of a better word…warrior types in the Guild.” <EOS>
<BOS> At this point the market is in chaos. People are running everywhere and a couple mini-fights have broke out, including a couple of the livelier slaves that are taking advantage of this situation. <EOS>
<BOS> You look at Madeline and your eyes gaze all over her naked body, this followed by your hands wandering. Madeline giggles a bit and touches you as well. <EOS>
<BOS> "Mm, true. Could have also been settled easily on my end too, but as I already said, I like to think we have enough fondness for each other that murder isn't a serious option." <EOS>
<BOS> “That doesn’t sound very useful if he disappeared to parts unknown.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, what about helping me like you did with Klint?” you chuckle. <EOS>
<BOS> You immediately see a moment in your youth when you were with your sister, playing and laughing in Teckleville. Such a happy time. <EOS>
<BOS> “You do?” <EOS>
<BOS> Later that night you address it directly before you both go to bed. <EOS>
<BOS> “Won’t the Order of Fel be pissed at you and in general?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> Well this just keeps getting weirder. All you know about the Raggedy Man Inn is that it’s in a worse part of Klyton than even you stay at. If this guy is some sort of courier, surely he already knows where to find you, especially if this is an urgent message from your family. And you can’t begin to know what that might be if true. And why the hell wouldn’t he just leave the message here? Unless it’s something he has to deliver personally. <EOS>
<BOS> You remember him mentioning he looked forward to having dinner at a famous restaurant on the pier. You find him there, dining on steak. He waves you to join him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Actually, at the time I wasn’t thinking at all except the obvious. In fact the only worry I had was that you might be fucking with me and were going to just leave me at the university with a massive hard on.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> “Perhaps, but think how much longer the intervals are starting to get, not to mention how much is he actually holding back? How long before he just stops sending altogether? No, we have to do something.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I want out.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> “Is this where I have to suck your dick?” Madeline asks in a tone almost implying that she could care less if she actually has to or not. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s not exactly what I mean, but if we’re going that route, I just thought I’d be doing slightly better while aligned with you lot.” <EOS>
<BOS> Fear wells up inside you upon hearing that news. You try to keep it together, but you’re having a hard time and you start exhaling multiple times, closing your eyes and muttering, “oh fuck, oh shit.” several times. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, Zal.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No. Thank you mortal. You’ve freed us both.” Tanya replies. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good news then. Today, you get to join them.” <EOS>
<BOS> You and Zal proceed into the natural cavern. After walking a bit, you make a remark that all of this might be pointless anyway and you might just head back because it wasn’t your intention on getting lost in a system of underground tunnels. <EOS>
<BOS> “Madeline, what…” you start to ask, and before you know it, she’s all over you. <EOS>
<BOS> The rest of the conversation goes fairly well with the clerk (Or Quincy as you learn his name) and he doesn't ask too many more questions. He just suggests that you get yourself registered as a proper Klyton citizen as soon as you can so you can participate in elections and similar functions. You hand over a large sum of coins to him and he hands over the deed and keys to you. <EOS>
<BOS> Without even realizing it, you’ve touched her other hand that’s on the table. <EOS>
<BOS> Perhaps Wendy never had any love for this ruthless monster of a son, but it's apparent he had love for her...or perhaps this was just the excuse to kill you. After all he never liked you after you criticized his work. <EOS>
<BOS> Doesn't take long before there is chaos on the ship and you're also fighting off your fellow enchanted crew mates. Well "fellow" might be too strong of a word since you didn't even like most of them. <EOS>
<BOS> Gwen goes over to you and starts to check you out, but you don’t feel like you really need any tending to either. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t let go…don’t let go…just hold me forever…” she says in between the tears. <EOS>
<BOS> “So what’s the plan? <EOS>
<BOS> Ideally, you could have separated yourself and just placed all the blame on the hobs and claiming that they weren’t part of the Nocturnal League, but Ludmilla was unfortunately a little smarter than just sending her troops into the woods and had a series of spies (Some of who you think were probably Felians, since you know she had ties to the church at one point). <EOS>
<BOS> You start going into an elaborate description of what you want the girl to look like. The madam nods a few times. <EOS>
<BOS> “You know what Gert?” <EOS>
<BOS> "He also didn't tell me everything last time. There's always a catch with him. In fact weren't you against dealing with him last time?" <EOS>
<BOS> On top of all that, you still haven’t found Sneaks. With only you, Marco and a couple others left, you’re finally done. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya, I command you to take off this curse you put on me.” You say trying to be as authoritative as you can, but honestly you’re scared shitless. <EOS>
<BOS> “NO! I’m not fucking finished! You’re gonna listen for a damn change, and don’t think your crying routine is going to work again, because I’m too pissed right now! Look, this is how it’s gonna be…” <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually there is some shouting heard outside, along with the crack of several whips. Before you know it you’re on your way. <EOS>
<BOS> "Not really, we know more than enough folks that we could have cheap employees. Some of them are hopeless gamblers with debts in fact, so that's no problem. As for alcohol, we could easily make it ourselves and bypass a supplier. Most folks coming wouldn't be there for the booze anyway, so it isn't like we're going to need hundreds of barrels of the stuff every month. Of course your family's old inn is in a slightly better part of Klyton, so my concern would be the greater likelihood of militia just stumbling in for a drink now and then." Zal remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> You give Hank an odd look. <EOS>
<BOS> You bid Tom goodbye and head on out to Mr. Reynolds' place which is a simple walk to one of the more rundown areas of Klyton. <EOS>
<BOS> You laugh at that remark. <EOS>
<BOS> Another pitiful Empire soldier attacks with lackluster technique. You easily parry the blade aside and slice at his open throat. A soft gurgle, and then he drops. Before his body hits the ground, you engage the next in line. They attack, halfway armed, some missing sections of their armor in attempt to mobilize quickly. Even if they were fully armed, you doubt they would put up much of a fight. Some reek with booze, others stagger under the influence of a stronger substance. They’re unprepared, untrained, and you make them pay for their lack of discipline. <EOS>
<BOS> “If you were in my position, would you?” you replies <EOS>
<BOS> You go into your story about Tanya and most of what that entails. While you’re speaking Ahmed occasionally holds up a glowing magic object to you and mumbles a few incantations. He just ignores you whenever you ask what he’s doing and finally he speaks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure, they’re elves. They are probably eager to play at a whole new location for a change. Plus Jenny will probably fuck all of them if that doesn’t convince them.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Because I’d rather he die of old age than him risk getting ripped to shreds. Besides I’m doing just fine racing him. Anyway, that’s it for me tonight, see you lot next week. Maybe we should play cards or dice next time, it’ll be a fairer fight.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah…you jealous? See? Why don’t you just admit that you fucked up, and breaking up with me was the worst mistake you ever made? Think about all time we’ve spent apart in this city yet still working great together as a team stealing from rich asshole’s houses that I’ve cased. It’s always been me and you versus everyone else. So much of that time while fruitful, could have been a lot more fun if we had been still intimate. I miss the fun we had. Don’t you miss the fun?” <EOS>
<BOS> "(Sigh) Yes Zal, but it's my fucking call and my fucking risk alright? Stop fucking questioning me every other sentence! Here, that's a list of some of the equipment we're going to need. Take some of the boys and go acquire some." You say shoving a piece of paper at Zal who takes it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Taken care of,” the lifeless voice speaks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um…no I guess not.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, okay. Thanks.” <EOS>
<BOS> "It's good to see you after what twenty years?" You say. <EOS>
<BOS> After about twenty minutes of combat, the streets are starting to pile up with bodies. You half expect the Watch to arrive with all the noise going on, but then the government has for the most part taken a slightly hands off approach to the religious conflict since it started, which explains why it’s gone on as long as it has. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah?” Grayhaze says as if you’re going to ask her age next. <EOS>
<BOS> Over the next few days you start making your routine visits to the university. You find it particularly easy to just go into the dorms and start pilfering things. These students have more money than a sense of security it seems. And the actual university security must be everyone that tried out for the Klyton militia and failed miserably. <EOS>
<BOS> You wake up midday. After getting yourself ready for today’s endeavors, you knock on Virgil’s door, but there is no answer. He’s either still asleep or he’s out collecting donations for Joachim. Probably the latter considering you didn’t contribute to his booze fund. <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad to hear we’re making Holgard safe for whores again at least.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I don’t want to hear anymore. Shut up and don’t bring up my condition again! Stick to jacking off or get yourself a whore, I don’t give a fuck WHAT you do, just fucking do it and get yourself under fucking control! You flirt with me again and it’ll be the last fucking time, got it?!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you absolutely sure?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Every logical fiber of your being tells you that you should just shut the fuck up, but maybe it’s your nerves or you feel like this is some sort of test or maybe its this woman herself…but whatever the reason… you don’t shut the fuck up. <EOS>
<BOS> You take a moment to catch your breath after running from the guards. Warts soon joins you, though he’s got more on his mind than just catching his breath. <EOS>
<BOS> Flynt takes another drink before continuing. <EOS>
<BOS> Keira excitedly starts to play her song. <EOS>
<BOS> “Never really planned to be in the position I’m currently in and the only god I’ve ever gave a few words to is Yag and even then not much.” <EOS>
<BOS> You haven’t lost hope on that dream though. Magic seems to be more common, or rather more impressive from what you’ve seen of it. The city of Galpatolis is protected by a giant invisible shield for example and when a dragon attacked (You nearly shit your pants when you saw one of those for the first time especially since it was much larger than the stories you heard) the beast couldn’t even penetrate the defenses and its breath attack was reflected back. Eventually it was brought down by more magical defenses that disintegrated it completely. <EOS>
<BOS> You observe through the makeshift woodland window. Twenty tents, probably more than three times that in head count. It doesn’t feel like the best way to mount an offensive strike. You can tell Seth is eager to strike -- he wants revenge for his men, but there must be a better approach. If they somehow separate their number, your chances of success significantly increase. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya says she’s still going with her original plan of leaping to the roof of the house and breaking in that way. You doubt if you could make it since the distance is a little farther than average, but then you aren’t blessed with infernal blood allowing you to do shit like that. You say you’re going to just go in the front door now that everyone is gone. Assuming he’s not in the cellar or not there at all, you’re guessing you’ll be able to catch him upstairs or down. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, you’ve been there? You’ve actually crossed into a different plane?” <EOS>
<BOS> “He’s uh…good I guess. Doctor now.” You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wow. Okay then. Oh, they aren’t too destructive are they?” <EOS>
<BOS> The next step is heading to the city property clerk, which you do the next day after rehearsing your story with Zalmora who also goes over the potential questions that might be asked. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well it occurs to me, the intel that I received on this invasion wasn’t completely accurate. And this inaccuracy could have easily resulted in a loss. I need a better intelligence system, The Felians were good at this, but Heather convinced me that their…departure would make things better. I’ve mostly relied on her divination and contacts within the Delantium Kingdom University. However, I feel this may be putting too much pressure on her since I’m sure you agree, all of this has been an ordeal for her.” Ludmilla remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Heh, well okay, but this could be a lot worse. In fact maybe Yag has blessed you with a little luck given your situation.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you wake up you surprisingly find yourself back at headquarters in your bed. You feel very drained and thirsty. Reminds you of when you were with Tanya. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately they also miss the demons they were trying to hit behind you. <EOS>
<BOS> You spend about a week getting to this new city. The third night aboard the ship, you have faint glimpses of Madeline’s face in your dreams. At first you’re concerned that you’re never going to get far enough, but you have no more dreams for the rest of the trip. <EOS>
<BOS> It's just a pocket of red and black rock, though the soil seems extra thick here. In the center, a circle of dark ashes ringed by small rocks sits. You make use of it, building a small fire with some twigs and tumbleweed, flint and stone. It isn't much, but it will keep you warm while you fall asleep. <EOS>
<BOS> After a few moments of running and backtracking, you’ve managed to make it home and lose most of the ones that were half heartedly trying to nab you, but it won’t be long before what passes for real law enforcement around here is beating down your door. You only have a short time to gather what you can and get the hell out of here. <EOS>
<BOS> "Hm, straight to business I see. Okay then, I assume there is some reason why you aren't having your own people taking care of this?" <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s exactly it. I like to get to know someone first before being intimate with them. Maybe that sounds weird to someone so free with their…sexual activity, but that’s just how I was raised and some things just stuck with me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Good, and with that, our business is concluded. I bid you good day and wish you well in your future endeavors, especially if it’s going to make the Syndicate money!” <EOS>
<BOS> "We should find out what these eggs are," Niro countered, "they could be something important. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fel also says that he wishes he could speak to me more often.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, but…” you start to say before you’re interrupted. <EOS>
<BOS> Your thoughts even goes to a dark place during this and you partially struggle to keep in mind that you shouldn’t actually be trying to strangle her to death. <EOS>
<BOS> "People of Salt Village," you begin, "I come to bring you a story! One that takes place in an ancient garden, a paradise planted by the gods when Sandrella was young. There were no people then, only animals blessed with speech. To twelve of them, those considered mighty and wise, the gods gave a fragment of a map - a single piece. As a whole, the map would lead them to a great treasure. The gods wished to see what their creation would do! But the animals each desired to find the treasure on their own, and would not work together or share their pieces. And as the months passed, they grew bored of the search, and many stopped looking. The bear returned to his favorite patch of berries, giving up, but along the way dropped his piece of the map. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh, yes." You gather the rest of your things, minus your destroyed cloak, and head to the upper deck. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well you don’t have to deal with her on a daily basis. However, you are correct in that pragmatism did also influence the decision to keep her around. I’m about the last very experienced wizard in this city now anyway. The few remaining true Dornans either left when I first got the school started or died during this invasion. Still it’ll be enough to turn back the tide. It’s just really taking its toll on me. Pretty sure you can already tell.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that’s one less thing to worry about at least.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I mean surely you’re not content on being a slave. Who would be? And I can tell even in your less than perfect condition, you obviously came from wealth. You certainly look more royal than my wife. You’re probably at least of noble birth. In any case, you are definitely not cut out to be a slave of any kind.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, they just forgot to spring you from a cage.” <EOS>
<BOS> The woman takes it, splitting it with her friend, whose jaw drops a little. It's probably more than they make in a couple weeks all together. They scoot over and allow you to sleep, and don't pester you with questions even after the man leaves. True to their word, they allow you to sleep in their tent and ride beside them - Balen moved your camel in the night, and changed out the color of its blanket - and, once in a while, they bring you some simple bread or fruit so you don't have to directly talk to others in the group. A couple days later, Balen works his camel up to your own. <EOS>
<BOS> “Bah, you humies always tryin’ ta cheat. Fine. Should be enuff for drink and Snuffit for awhile anyways.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well hope youz brought extra pants den. Really though, it’s a lot safer. Da ghost really only messes with people that go in that cabin. I mean if you wanna risk it, we could go another way I know, but there’s been a lotta bandits travelling back an through that area. Normally, I’d just go that way since I know all da best hidin’ places and even if they did see me, I’d disappear again before they could even mount an attack. However you’re probably not as stealthy as me, so you’d probably get yerself seen and gutted. Might even rut wit youz first, some of these bandits aren’t picky.” <EOS>
<BOS> But what are you really going to do, if you do find her? Kill her? You’re not going to do that even with as mad as you are, you know damn well you wouldn’t be able to. You’ve never even hit her (except slapping her ass during sex) the whole time you were together and she was bitching at you constantly and arguably that was worse than what she just did to you since it was ongoing. <EOS>
<BOS> You put your hands around Vera’s neck, but are very aware of not to actually choke her (Even if she is telling you to squeeze a little harder at times). As fucked up as Vera might be for requesting this, you’re definitely thinking that you’re probably worse since you’re starting to enjoy this. <EOS>
<BOS> Days pass into weeks and you more or less keep to yourself and just eat with the rest of the crew when its time then go back to your place in the cargo hold. <EOS>
<BOS> “So, you’ve returned. I know you’re the one that so rudely broke into my home and stole that girl years ago. We were a little pre-occupied in nabbing you before and you seem to be skilled enough to fight off our recent attempts. Not sure why you stupidly decided to believe you could get away with walking in here alone again, but you’ll soon learn that was a very grave mistake. Going to have something very special planned for you.” <EOS>
<BOS> You oblige, spinning them a dark tale around the dinner courses and dessert of a young lady who insists on sleeping in a coffin. But on the eve of her marriage, her husband refuses to let her go to her coffin, and clings to her in their large bed. In the morning, he wakes to find his arms wrapped around a skeleton. <EOS>
<BOS> “Now THAT is wishful thinking and not what is happening.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, well I did just confess to you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m in fucking hell?” <EOS>
<BOS> Strangely that logic makes a bit of sense to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, but the Nocturnal League still exists and if I had retreated to Jicol I would have just been running it there, unless you had assassins waiting for me on the way.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Unless you’re openly cursing Fel name, I doubt if he’s concerned. You would have certainly known by now. I mean I do agree that you probably caught his attention in some manner since your son is definitely skilled. Was he conceived in that temple by any chance?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well since you were unwilling to steal me one of those nice necklaces, I guess I’ll have to buy a cheap ass one from that hag that runs Sparkling Treasures.” Annah replies. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well, I’m starting to re-examine things going on in my life and cutting down on potential problems even at great cost is a lot more inviting everyday. However, I obviously still can’t just pick up a leave, I need to get shit together first. Might take a few weeks considering that I have to contact the Syndicate and who knows how long they’ll take to get back with me, though I’m hoping fairly quick if I’m telling them about handing over Holgard to them.” <EOS>
<BOS> “But enough about these things. Let us talk more about you…” Graham says leaning his girth towards you and being bold enough now to put his hand on your leg, which you immediately pull away. <EOS>
<BOS> “You still PAID him?! You paid him for doing a half assed job?! What the fuck?!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “NO! LIES! NEROTH IS THE FATHER OF LIES AND EVIL! JOACHIM! BRING DOWN YOUR HOLY VENGENCE AND SAVE ME!” Yinen shouts and suddenly lunges at you. <EOS>
<BOS> Or maybe you'll just stay here. You'll see how it turns out. <EOS>
<BOS> The crowd goes nuts at this decision and the Teckleville Watch barely manage to get you back to the jail unscathed. After throwing you back in your cell, Sheriff Walford flips his desk over as his men standby. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well it’s a little more complicated than that. The key to being in charge is also trying not to be hated. And what about Camid? I thought you and he were together.” <EOS>
<BOS> Mira’s death was the first time I experienced complete, and utter, defeat. It was like watching the experience out of my own body, unable to act, unable to cry out. I’m not prideful enough to say it doesn’t scare me. After all, who wouldn’t be frightened by an unknown power, an unknown force potent enough to take over oneself completely? I study my actions, along with the times the voice appears. There must be a pattern, there must be a winning strategy. There always is. <EOS>
<BOS> Suddenly the large window behind Rook shatters as two small fireballs break through. Still being near the doorway, you’re not in immediate danger, but you duck behind the entryway anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> She’s pretty pissed at you though so you don’t know if that ship has sailed. <EOS>
<BOS> You take a moment to gather up some of the things you thought about saying to Peter and then throw out most of it before you speak. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes," she hugs you, and you breath in the soft scent of Frangia blossoms from her hair. "We are going to save the world." <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh the ECS is good at being patient when it wants to be. Revenge was planned, but they wanted to come up with something suitable. Now of course the standby for a less direct approach at revenge was doing something horrible to your family and loved ones…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that’s your first problem right there. Joining a criminal organization that’s currently feuding with another one isn’t exactly a stable future son.” Sneaks says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t ask, in fact after this is all over I might not even have any people. Anyway, I still think splitting up is a bad idea, but I guess if you say you can handle it yourself, I trust you.” <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually they get Clyde off of you, but it’s too late. He’s stomped your head into mush. You can’t even see anymore and you’re already losing your hearing. <EOS>
<BOS> “So how long you been in there?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah seriously. You’ll have a fuckin’ riot on yer hands as soon as you break da news. Sum are gonna feel betrayed. Sum don’t like the Syndicate. Others are gonna be tryin’ ta take power. An all doze hobs you recruited? Theys just gonna be confused. Let da Syndicate handle the mess. I mean I trust dat Vera’s already got people in Jicol right? Not like you need any of them from here anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Heh. Sarah’d likely finish the job these Imperial soldiers failed to do if you tried.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Who else is down here Flint?!” Zamed says <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait a minute, did you say join you?” <EOS>
<BOS> You look around and see that now several of the statues are coming to life. The exit is blocked by that ghostly thing so even if you could maneuver past the statues, you aren’t getting out that way. <EOS>
<BOS> You briefly go down one of the tunnels and soon find that you’re ankle deep in water. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh it is, I assure you. I don’t get much call for enchantments, probably because nobody bothers to ask, but I got a medallion lying around that I can enchant for your son to wear so when he goes to sleep it should block out any potential mental meddling.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Then you’re lucky to still be alive, monk,” Ragar interrupts. <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t killed right away, but after a couple of weeks you wish you had. By the time you’re sacrificed, you’re a babbling mess that is grateful for death. <EOS>
<BOS> "The crazy bitch walked in on me changing once and she made up some twisted fantasy!" <EOS>
<BOS> “If you’re still blessed by Yag at this point, he’ll honor the favor he owes me and give you a bit of protection for a while. Maybe a year at most. Should be more than enough time for you to get settled in and learn the routines without extra hassle. After that, you’re going to be on your own. Now I’m no recruiter, but I suggest that since you’ll already be getting the benefits of Ebony Claw protection, you might want to get in good with us on a permanent basis, as it will potentially make the rest of your stay slightly less dangerous. I’m sure Ponyride will have something for you to do, but that’s on you and your choice.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What’re you going to be doing?” <EOS>
<BOS> They aren’t survivors at all – they are zombies! And you’ve inadvertently walked right into a mob of forty to fifty of them! <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck, did you at least kill one of the bastards?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe once, and then they’d probably execute everyone on board. Our people aren’t exactly the most subtle, if you were thinking about having them masquerade as merchants.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh I agree with you on that. It is time to give him a little push again.” Zalmora remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Children?!” <EOS>
<BOS> “YOU said this was for MY benefit!” <EOS>
<BOS> A weeks' worth of food. Three pairs of clothing. A blanket. 50 pieces of silver - all your savings. There isn't a lot you can take, since you will have to travel light. And it will not be easy - you will have to trust that you can earn money along the way, whether by odd jobs or by telling stories, if you hope to keep traveling once your funds run out. But there is one item above all others that you must take: Ivani's Book of Tales. <EOS>
<BOS> “I could try. Maybe I could take a few others with me to help.” <EOS>
<BOS> You immediately turn with Kol in your arms and duck down while trying to run back into the store. <EOS>
<BOS> There are a few other smaller factions, but they’re so low that they’re barely worth considering. <EOS>
<BOS> When you enter, you surprisingly see Baroness dressed for battle; no fancy royal robes, she’s wearing finely made armor. A sword even hangs by her side. Apparently she was fully prepared to not go quietly if need be. <EOS>
<BOS> “We need to take out that fleet. If Peter gets away, turning back this invasion isn’t going to matter.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You make a mental note that you'll need to be more careful if you pick anymore pockets though, apparently you're rusty enough in that endeavor that you're getting caught even if it isn't by the folks you're actually doing it to. <EOS>
<BOS> "And I won't bunk with a blood priestess!" the mage seethes. <EOS>
<BOS> "Then, please," the man offers, "work for us for a week. That is, volunteer for us - we won't pay you - but you can keep whatever the crowd offers you as is tradition. An hour before lunch, every day." <EOS>
<BOS> Well you made your decision with your dick…again. <EOS>
<BOS> Through two tree trunks, Ekk’a spotted his prey. The buck is young, although still much larger than the average doe. Its antlers rise from its head like branches of a stream. The buck’s head lifted for a moment, sensing the air. Too late. Ekka’s arrow fired true, landing squarely in the buck’s neck. One arrow was not enough to drop it, and it took off into the forest, a cursing Ekk’a following. <EOS>
<BOS> Very tempting, but while you think you could get the drop on one, you don’t think you’d be able to get both of them, which you suppose answers the Shadow Blade’s question earlier. <EOS>
<BOS> Ardan is obviously older than Keira by probably at least twenty years since she’s probably about your age. You sort of wonder how this relationship even got started, but then again an older guy with a much younger woman isn’t that uncommon. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not a fucking whore, I had enough of being called that in Teckleville! And I’m not going to pretend to be one, just because you’re scared of these three assholes.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, he killed Daniel!” <EOS>
<BOS> One begins under the Mage Academy itself - you would need either a sympathetic mage to help you find it, or to pay off one of the mages with a hefty bribe. <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad you recognized me, even though I’m a little less than I originally was when we first met. But then I have you or more specifically your little wizard allies to thank for that don’t I? Ugh, I’m sitting down, feel free to keep your weapon on me though if it makes you feel better. Fucking wooden leg…” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re talking nonsense.” You snort. <EOS>
<BOS> “And there it is…and here I am.” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t know…” <EOS>
<BOS> The bottom of the staircase opens into a large room filled with rows and rows of cages, far as the eye can see. Lorthander waves his fingers illuminating the room in red light. To his horror, Prince Ragar sees that most of the cages are filled with people. Their bony wrists hang pinned against the cells in a "T" shape, which only draw more attention to their lack of nourishment. Each prisoner is on the verge of starvation, and not even a loin cloth covers their shame. The prisoners are naked, dying, and don’t even react to Lorthander and Prince Ragar as they’ve given up hope. <EOS>
<BOS> "I love the way you involved the children!" <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s it?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ugh, how gauche. I suppose it will have to do.” Elana remarks and gets out of the carriage. You step off from the top. <EOS>
<BOS> You follow the road to Holgard and of course when you get to the city gates you get stopped. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, there you are! I was thinking you left for Arcanius without saying goodbye. I mean not that you need to, but it would be the polite thing to do.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose that did make things easier. Thanks again for you help on this. The expression on Gloom’s face was priceless when he realized the orb didn’t work!” <EOS>
<BOS> You glance around the room for some quick inspiration. The lantern is still flickering in the window, casting unsteady light over the rough floorboards. <EOS>
<BOS> “Mrs., Mrs. Correlis. Your story was – beautiful.” She dabs at her eyes with the handkerchief. “It was like you knew him, somehow.” <EOS>
<BOS> “GWEN! FUCKING CONCENTRATE!” <EOS>
<BOS> When Scully said the Steadfast wasn't the biggest ship in the harbor, he wasn't kidding. Not that it's a rowboat and it definitely needs a crew to sail it, but compared to some of the others you've seen, you can tell you're not exactly going to be sailing with anyone of great infamy. You imagine that's why Scully said they mostly raid small coastal villages. <EOS>
<BOS> “Deal with it again?” <EOS>
<BOS> Hell, now you feel like you're doing a good deed. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ll be on guard nonetheless.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, point taken, just don’t drink them all.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I agree…but the idea does have some merit. If we did get Scales back, we’d be in a lot better shape, muscle wise at least.” Zal remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Speaking of fucking, who was that big dark skinned guy who you were reluctant to leave when you were getting off the ship?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Never mind all that, we gotta start cleaning shit up around here. Vaughn, I want you to start dismantling the stills and moving the tubs from the basement and into the sewers. Just glad we have a lot of already filled barrels down there. We should be good on that front. Zal, you dismantle the gambling tables and wheels and move them into the sewers as well." <EOS>
<BOS> The town is divided into two sections - the main town, and Inrit Gardens. You are well-known to the townfolk as you have spent over half your life telling stories to them and buying food and supplies. But Inrit Gardens is a place for tourists and the rich who planted summer homes there. Like most village-folk, you avoid it unless there is a reason to go. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit…fuck man. There’s no need for damn rape threats. Fine, you wanna go see Rook you crazy fucker, be my fucking guest. You’re still not getting past those Shadow Blade guys though and if you do, Rook’s going to be pissed at you for killing some of his top Blue Dream dealers anyway. I hope he fucking cuts your dick and balls off and shoves them down your throat!” The female Claw member says and starts motioning for the others to open the gates while you collect the bloody heads and shove them back the bag. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sad to say, but in a sense yes. Honestly, we’re asking for a little more than that. We want you to take over our temple’s taxes just so we still have a roof over our heads. The temple has been our home for quite awhile along with having special meaning spiritually for the remainder of us, so we are very reluctant to leave it. In exchange, we will act as soldiers for the Nocturnal League. Whatever you need done, we’ll do it. I’m sure you could use our talents in your line of work. If you wish, we will even teach shadow magic to those willing to learn and have the talent. <EOS>
<BOS> "Carl and Annie's mother showed up at the tavern last night and pitched a bitch. I mean she raised holy hell. Literally too. She had a book of Joachim in hand the entire time." Vaughn says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Better half than all.” Dusk replies while wincing a bit from his pain. <EOS>
<BOS> The bandit you killed doesn’t really have anything of value on him, though you do take his short sword since one can never have too many weapons. After that’s done, Warts tells you to follow him and the pair of you are off again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hero of Holgard” you’re called and it’s probably the biggest lie of them all. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shut your fucking mouth. Bleed. Bleed. Fucking BLEEED!” <EOS>
<BOS> You actually manage to survive just long enough to see a winged figure crash through the large window in the room before your vision goes completely black forever. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright, alright, yeah. I just want to make sure this is something you REALLY want, because once I start this ritual I can’t have you having second thoughts in the middle of it. It would be bad for ALL involved.” <EOS>
<BOS> “This is fucked.” You mutter. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I’ve picked more complex merchant lockboxes.” You say confidently. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um…shit…I didn’t want to tell you. I thought you’d be mad. But…” Vera exhales deeply and then continues. “I have had dealings with the ECS, but I sort of had to. I mean they still wanted a cut of the profits, what could I do? I know you would understand that part, but I’m guessing you’re not too pleased to find out I was slave trading again.” <EOS>
<BOS> "No, I'm afraid you've confused me with my father. But my mother and father are still married and well." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> "I can manage that," you say, not sure if you really can. If you understand his implications correctly, you are "saving" people only so they can die or be enslaved later. <EOS>
<BOS> “Youz gotta be the luckiest Yag blessed bastard I know, beside myself. You shoulda died so many times, Yag musta been rollin’ loaded dice. However, an’ don’t say dis offen but dere iz a time ta step away from da table and dis iz one o’ dem times. I myself have stayed alive as long as I have cuz I knew when ta walk away.” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well there were a couple survivors, but I think their whorin’ days are over.” <EOS>
<BOS> The next day just when you think your life can’t get any more complicated… <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, Grand Matriarch.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes. Just haven’t done it since I was a child though. I guess it’s not important anyway. My point is I’m worried that I might become a complete monster and I don’t want you to be in my path when that happens since you’ll most likely be the first victim.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Then there’s nothing to worry about, come on lover, I got my own lock that I want your pick in.” <EOS>
<BOS> You tell your people to extra careful for traps and to keep alert, you then proceed to hunt down the last of the JCR. <EOS>
<BOS> “I know you will kid, you’ve always been a good earner. Looks like Yag really blessed me when you I met you in that cage that night. Good thing the rest of that lot out there were late after all.” <EOS>
<BOS> You look over to your right and nearly jump when you find Vera lying next to you just staring. <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course I am. Did you not want me to be?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Heh, glad she survived. What about mom and dad?" <EOS>
<BOS> The streets… <EOS>
<BOS> You suddenly feel a crushing blow to the back of your head and you crumple on top of Annah’s body. You have a little strength left to push yourself up a bit, but another blow succeeds in knocking you out. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright what the hell’s going on back here?” the sergeant asks riding his horse back to the cart. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I suppose he was. He was an asshole most of the time towards me. Always thought it was funny to sat untrue things about my mother, but I knew him since childhood too and he was often there to help if I needed it. If he had still been alive, I would have been out of that cage on time. I’m guessing your father never mentioned him either.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why not?” <EOS>
<BOS> “No…wait, how is Vaughn like?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, Annah. I’ll come with you, but that sort of makes this getting elven musicians and shit here sort of pointless.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t insult me by fucking lying! I SAW you! I’ve been following what you were up to since I didn’t think you’d meekly accept Garrick’s orders. I didn’t however believe that you’d go full fucking traitor! How the hell was I so damn stupid to trust you?!” <EOS>
<BOS> You need a place to perform that has enough foot traffic to make it worthwhile and is unlikely to be full of people already harassing the crowds for money at the same time. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?!” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> She leaves you alone to practice. You slip the blindfold back on and pull yourself onto the beams. With each hop and technique you practice, you imagine facing an opponent in the unarmed competition. You imagine, specifically, each of your peers in front of you and their tendencies. Then, you imagine the counter. An overaggressive striker leaves himself open to a takedown. A grappler looks to grab hold of their opponent, best not to throw many kicks and give them an opening. Brawlers want to drag you into their chaotic mess. Similarly, a disciplined, but inexperienced, fighter might be lost in the chaos and forget their well-practiced techniques. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh shit. Thank the gods, you’re still alive!” you say and immediately hold her tight. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah comes to meet you the day before with a few bags (and Checkers who is still the furry little demon dog that growls at you when she sees you) stating that Nature’s Revenge will be coming tomorrow night along with a few other amateur bard types, but definitely better than the chick spouting shitty poetry on a regular basis. She says word is already spreading around the university and there should be a large crowd. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well does that matter? I’d argue that familiarity is one of the more minor factors in whether you can trust someone or not. I mean there were a few times in the Talons where apparent friends backstabbed each other.” <EOS>
<BOS> Zal purses her lips and gives you an irritated look for a moment, but then she forces a smile and nods. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because the leader of the Dornans came to me yesterday begging for an alliance. She wants me to turn on you. She even gave me one of these again.” <EOS>
<BOS> At which point you collapse nearly directly on top of her and lose consciousness right there in the alley. <EOS>
<BOS> Suddenly a lot of noise and shouting can be heard from outside and one of the mercs rides up to the window. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, okay. I’ll see you soon Vera.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Life is good. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah and I’m glad to see that didn’t interrupt your important work. Thought you were supposed to be helping.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, yeah, there will be, now come on.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t mention it, princess.” You mock. <EOS>
<BOS> The head Shadow Blade whispers to one of his comrades who enters the mansion. <EOS>
<BOS> And for all you know this could still all be some elaborate illusion. <EOS>
<BOS> Deities in any other sense seem to be fringe beliefs at best or considered to be reserved for uncivilized barbarians that live outside the empire. <EOS>
<BOS> “Undress please, we’ll be starting soon.” Heather says to you before addressing Gwen. “Gwen did you make the other circles?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Seriously?” Tom asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You look away briefly and see Heather with a couple of other wizard behind her. <EOS>
<BOS> “…What? Are you serious? Dr. Gossey said this trip was paid for!” <EOS>
<BOS> After Vaughn opens up the escape hatch to the sewers, you try to maintain your cool as you fiddle with your safe and unload its contents all the while axes, halberds and bullets are piercing the barricaded door. <EOS>
<BOS> You exhale deeply. <EOS>
<BOS> In the condition you’re in and how quick he’s moving, you question if you’ll even be able to hit him, but you also know you’re currently not much good in a straight up fight right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course it could be a case that she’s perfectly fine being a potential whore if it’s going to benefit her in the long run. Since you’re the boss, and the only one above her in rank, makes sense that she’d only be offering you such extra “benefits.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Fucking bitch!” KF shouts, getting in an upright position, kicking Checkers off of his leg and slapping Annah at the same time. <EOS>
<BOS> With those words you move in and finally kiss Vera on the lips. She embraces the kiss and grabs your head as you do so as if this is all she’s ever wanted. And it probably is. It probably would be more enjoyable for you as well if things were different. (And if she hadn’t just vomited) <EOS>
<BOS> You son wakes up hearing both your voices. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck.” You utter and stumble out the door. <EOS>
<BOS> “That it? Figured we’d go around a third time.” Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> The blindfold around your head prevents you from seeing your footing. You stand on a series of narrow wooden beams. The beams are lifted several feet from the ground. It wouldn’t be a fatal fall, but it’d definitely leave a mark.. Focusing your mind, you try to imagine the placement of each beam as you hop between them. Upon each successful landing, you let loose a series of strikes from the practice sword in your hand. As you’re no stranger to the balancing structure, you keep your mind highly aware of which beam you’re on. Not all the beams are separated evenly apart, and you’ve witnessed more than a couple unlucky acolytes misjudge their position. Your mind is focused on the task and— <EOS>
<BOS> The air around the Emperor’s hand fills with a dark purple cloud. Sizzling, like meat on a stovetop, starting around his hand. The flesh around the Emperor’s hand rapidly decays, deteriorating, swept away like soft bark in a hurricane. He screams and loses hold of the amulet, letting it fall from his grasp down to the ground below. The Emperor regathers himself, and lets loose a shadow bolt towards you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, not really. Even Jenny, the one I just helped I’m only good with because she helped with a couple jobs last year.” <EOS>
<BOS> While normally you’d take this opportunity to run, you’re pissed enough at the orc for trying to kill you in the first place and grateful enough that this woman just probably saved your life. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I guess concludes our business and it looks like I’m going to be staying here a little longer to sort things out. I’ll give you the day to gather your belongings and leave the city. Hmmmm, maybe I should contact that rogue Temple to Fel while I’m here too. They probably should be brought back into the fold…” <EOS>
<BOS> For various reasons together they moved away from the city and to a quieter smaller town called Teckleville. There the young man opened a private practice and became a respected member of the community and had twins with Eliza. <EOS>
<BOS> “ROOK! I swear to Fel I am NOT doing that! This…” <EOS>
<BOS> No soon have you said yes, when Mr. Reynolds closed smile becomes a disturbing toothy grin. <EOS>
<BOS> "I know," you hear a voice in your mind. "Your journey has been like watching a distant dream." <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I did, an’ she told me to come ta youz cuz youz might object to sum of dem.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well it’s not up to me.” <EOS>
<BOS> "No," Ivani says sadly, "I didn't ask to live. I don't want the humans to harmed." <EOS>
<BOS> “Is he dead?” Brother Samuel asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You take Vera’s hand and look into her eyes. <EOS>
<BOS> “Is that right?” <EOS>
<BOS> After looting Graham’s body, you remember that there is a skirmish going on outside. A quick glance shows several bandit types fighting the mercs. The mercs are out numbered, but thanks to their armor and better training, they’re doing a good job of fending off the bandits. <EOS>
<BOS> Seth bends one of the candlesticks near the shrine sideways and pulls another towards him. As he stands back, a low rumble begins from the shrine. Scraping heavily, the top of shrine starts to move to the side. You can see a short staircase from where the shrine used to lay, leading to an underground passageway. <EOS>
<BOS> By the gods you have missed her mouth… <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you break his jaw causing him to moan and wail, or at least the best he can do with a broken jaw. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah Vaughn, and where the hell were you guys? I thought you were supposed to come get me yesterday!” <EOS>
<BOS> Later when you inform Marco, (who was just starting to enjoy his time off) he is indeed not happy about hearing what his latest task is going to be, but you don’t need him to be happy about it, just compliant. Which of course he is. He does carouse extra harder though for the remainder of the time off you’ve given him though. <EOS>
<BOS> "And at last Vaughn has brought you to me, I trust he's filled you in on the basics of what's going on." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Once you settle that in your mind you’re able to get on with it, with fewer issues. You still end up having some thoughts about those dead women, and even Vera and the whores you were with today. Except it wasn’t quite as vivid. <EOS>
<BOS> “I came enough to fill a fucking moat. Hah! Glad to see Mr. Scars remembers the good times. Alright, I dunno how he knows you, but if he trusted you enough to give you that phrase, then it’s good enough for me. So I’m guessing you want protection right?” <EOS>
<BOS> I wonder what happened to Kassi after I left with Seth. Often I think about her. She was my only friend, along with Brother Samuel though he was more in the mentor, father role. Did I leave her to die? No, she had the same choice presented in front of her. She could have escaped along with me. If she met her end that day, it was her decision, not mine. I wonder if anyone escaped that day. Death was inevitable if we stayed. The Empire doesn’t take unnecessary risks like leaving highly trained warriors alive. Part of me feels bad for leaving Kass, but I cannot think that way. We each act to the best of our ability, and the outcome is no one’s fault, really. It’s just the way things are. <EOS>
<BOS> You sit up and caress Madeline’s shoulders and back. <EOS>
<BOS> "See? Told you this was the best way to handle it." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Do you think the castle is really haunted?” another asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you sure dividing our force is the best option?” you ask, feeling your chin in thought. <EOS>
<BOS> "I know of many stories," you say, "but if I spoke them they might fade." <EOS>
<BOS> Of course your situation is still pretty damn dire. You’re stuck in the past and unless you get access to some really powerful magic, you’re going to be living the rest of your life here no matter what else you achieve. <EOS>
<BOS> This is sounding complicated already. You almost hesitate to ask about the other one. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well it wasn’t,” Brother Trevor answers. “One may not reach enlightenment if they are focused on being funny, rather than being disciplined.” <EOS>
<BOS> You decide to write a letter to them. You’re going to keep it short and vague and you don’t expect any attempt at contact back, but at least they’ll know that you’re alive and doing well. (Even if they’re skeptical about how you explain things in your letter to them) <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh?” Vera asks with a mild annoyance that you didn’t kiss her back. <EOS>
<BOS> If the magic here has that power, then surely there might be a way back home with it. The main problem is magic seems to be highly restricted to the upper class. Like nobles and such. It isn’t even like you’ve ever found any practicing hedge wizards or witches. Those types apparently get rounded up fairly quickly or they probably live far away from the Empire, which is pretty damn large. (As far as you can tell you’re currently located where the Delantium Kingdom would be located and Galpatis Empire stretches much more than that.) <EOS>
<BOS> “Quiet yourself,” the Grandmaster interjects. “We have not been overrun in a thousand years. I’ll not allow it to happen now.” <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora doesn't try to stop you, she probably knew this was a possibility. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes sir!" Camid remarks before leaving. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I agree. Better for business all around.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You…you caught me by surprise! I’m only human damn it! Look, you’re obviously a very attractive girl and maybe you’re into me because I’m being supportive in your dreams or something, but we can’t do this.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, this is why you’d make a good spymaster. You’re a realist that doesn’t have delusions of grandeur! You’re right of course, I am the friendly dragon, but you at least wouldn’t have to worry about the friendly dragon’s minions because you’d indirectly be in charge of them, to a limited degree of course. Better to stand with the dragon than be under its talons.” <EOS>
<BOS> You figure you can always talk to Tom later, but Zalmora might not be in the mood later if you turn her down now. She’s actually attractive in a trashy sort of way (Sort of reminds you of Annah in that way), it’s just she seemed sort of inaccessible since she was several years older and never paid much attention to you before. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, you’re right of course. There is no real honor among rogues. I ran like the preverbal thief in the night to save my own ass, and it was the smartest thing I ever did. I should have done it again as soon as I learned about you being here instead of letting sentimentality of my old friend and wounded pride cloud my judgment.” <EOS>
<BOS> Before you can ponder what exactly is going on, a voice suddenly pierces your mind. <EOS>
<BOS> "Hey mister, you need to buy the paper today! It's special edition!" The boy shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> "The muses did ally with us to save the planet," the mage shakes his head, "but do not mistake that for friendship. Humans and muses have been at odds with eachother for millenia, perhaps since the beginning of the world." <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well I always sort of figured those might be my options anyway, but what do YOU want? I mean I get the reasons for you pushing me away, but is that what you really want?” <EOS>
<BOS> Heather doesn’t even acknowledge your goodbye and just turns away to leave, walking a lot slower than she used to. <EOS>
<BOS> "It's the life we've chosen." <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya blocks the beam with one hand and then waves her other arm and suddenly most of the furniture in the room is thrown against the door to barricade it. Meanwhile you get out of the way so you don’t get hit by Heather’s magic or get stepped on by Tanya’s cloven hooves. <EOS>
<BOS> Later that night, your sister takes off to parts unknown and you prepare yourself for the hell that your parents are no doubt going to raise. Truth be told, if you left, they probably wouldn’t cause as much fuss…okay well maybe that’s not entirely true, but still, your sister has always been the favorite so they’re going to take this hard. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good for him. Glad to hear things ultimately worked out after our business was concluded. And they say loans are a bad thing. So what can I do for you today? I assume it can’t be for money as I know you’re quite the skilled thief around town. I must say the Crimson Talons must be doing better nowadays. Pity you have that fool Tom in charge, but then these things are never permanent are they?” Mr. Reynolds says. <EOS>
<BOS> “I swear I’m not here for a few days and this place goes to shit. Where’s David?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Uh, sort of a bushy beard, but the rest of his face was obviously pretty weathered. Shaved head. Probably in his forties or fifties, but still pretty fit. Carried a pack with him, but no weapons. Well at least none out in the open. Said to tell you that he’d carrying an important message for you from your family and that it’s very urgent that you meet him at the Raggedy Man Inn.” <EOS>
<BOS> When the tavern keeper pours you a cup of apple cider, you go to pay for it and find what little coin you had in your pocket is gone! You check you other pockets and still nothing. <EOS>
<BOS> "Muses of the Sacred Grove!" you cry, "Harken to my tale! I am a simple man, an old man, who has lived and loved and lost like any other human on this small world. I once fell in love with a muse, a beautiful muse, who danced by the shores of Lake Firayah. She was a muse of heroes, inspiring men to dare great feats and woman to break customs, yet she chose me - a man content to stay in one place and dream away the years. Ivani was my love, is my love! We hid this from you, fearing your censure, unwilling to stoke tension between the muses and the humans. We hoped our children would bring a new peace to the world. <EOS>
<BOS> Kol nods and runs off with his book. <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve worked too hard and grown too accustomed to your life style here and you’re not about to be scared off. You just need to make some severe changes. The irony that you’re actually going to work hard to keep an inn open isn’t lost on you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I don’t know about you, but a title like governor or mayor doesn’t sound nearly as impressive. Besides if you remember I do have royal blood in my veins.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well a coin’s a coin, don’t you have a house to break into or something?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> You tried. You really tried. But you can’t. You just can’t any longer. The temptation is too great and this woman is too damn skilled, along with being very pretty. (At least from what you can tell, she’s still partially covered with her mask) <EOS>
<BOS> If you start killing people in the middle of the street in front of everyone, you’re just going to bring unwanted heat on you by the Holgard Watch and unlike the Syndicate you don’t have the luxury of having them in your pocket to look the other way. You pick yourself up and begin running again. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course twenty years ago, you wouldn’t have believed that you’d wind up as head of one of the most powerful organizations in a major city state either. You’re far from being the simple rogue you once were. Holgard’s Silent Ones keep order better than the Watch ever could. Ironic that Holgard has never been safer than it has under your eye. Even the Ebony Claw Syndicate knows better than to try to set up shop here again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, Ludmilla is very big on defense nowadays. Understandable though given what happened.” <EOS>
<BOS> The next day, Keira wakes you up at the crack of dawn and the pair of you leave Tarvo. <EOS>
<BOS> “You don’t know how long I’ve wanted to do this…” she says and then goes in to try to kiss you again before you stop her. <EOS>
<BOS> "Who is that? Don't you see the family resemblance? This fine gentleman is the late great Olaf's son!" Mr. Reynolds exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> "What?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> So you go back to Vera and Ludmilla and stand nearby in an attempt to be social. Ludmilla goes back and forth speaking to you and Vera, though she surprisingly is more talkative to Vera. The Baroness seems to like to talk and can already guess that you’re not exactly the most gregarious. <EOS>
<BOS> "Actually it was Vaughn who suggested it in the first place." Zal remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Who are you? We’re trying to clear the streets of people right now and don’t need anyone skulking about! Where is your home?” one of them says. <EOS>
<BOS> “I do!” the girl says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fire!” a monk near the plateau’s edge yells. <EOS>
<BOS> “What about this Sneaks asshole?” Marco asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you okay?! You look really pale, I have some water in my pack.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shut up! Shut the fuck up. YOU brought this on yourself. Up until now, you’ve just been playing, but this is what happens when you make bad fucking choices. There are consequences.” you say as you prod the knife into his face so it bleeds. <EOS>
<BOS> Seems that Zal hasn't quite gotten all the "rogue" out of her system despite everything she's claimed. You can certainly relate, but not so much because you're against ratting them out, but more because killing them is a more final solution to a potential problem. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why not? What else are we going to do, get real jobs? Besides, things are actually going a little bit better than they were with Edmond. Tom’s not likely to start executing folks over small mistakes at least. Plus in this line of work it’s a lot better to have a few people watching your back. Now how about we stop all this talking and go to your room where you can watch my back up close?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ha ha funny guy. What’s the real story?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Surrender now and we might even leave you in good enough condition to stand before the judge!” one of the soldiers says. <EOS>
<BOS> “I know. It’s okay.” <EOS>
<BOS> Originally, the Guild was more of a loose confederation of thieves and such. Nobody ever forced anyone to join, but there were benefits if you did such as not having to worry about paying extra for fencing stolen goods, ease of bribing guards for major crimes, etc. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not that I know of,” Seth answers. “Unless they want to climb up sheer mountainside.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, yes I think so.” <EOS>
<BOS> You do this for quite some time, but she doesn’t arrive, neither does anyone else and you’re starting to get sleepy. You try to calm Kol down with an increasingly weaker voice. <EOS>
<BOS> You soon hear several voices shouting in excitement and getting louder. Doesn’t take long before the carriage door (which is now above you due to how the carriage flipped) opens up and you’ve got someone with a crossbow pointing at you. <EOS>
<BOS> However, one night when you’re in bed you awaken and sit up with your pistol drawn from under your pillow. <EOS>
<BOS> Seems Tanya is trying to figure out a few things in light of trying to handle all her recent actions and physical changes. She tells you that she would like you to stay to help her, but she would completely understand if all you want to do is put as much distance as you can between yourself and this place. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s because I used to be one. In fact I was a member of that very temple you’re currently using when I was young and foolish. Even had one of those silly names they all like using. Grayhaze. I suppose it was better than my original name at least. Don’t ask.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Youz don’t I suppoze. Take yer chances going alone an’ getting lost, don’t care. I just try to earn a little extra coin for drink an’ leadin’ clueless humies like yerself gets me some…well when they aren’t throwin’ rocks at me that is.” <EOS>
<BOS> Now you’re wondering if this means Percy and the other one are here to take away your son…or is Fel referring to other agents that he hasn’t sent yet? <EOS>
<BOS> You wave your hand away dismissively and tell your remaining people to go on with their work. You head to your office, though Zalmora and Vaughn follow you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well they did. It was a slaughter, save for one man.” <EOS>
<BOS> "We'll get promotions for this!" You hear one exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> That’s it; you’ll always be a slave to loving Tanya. You were doomed when you first laid eyes on her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Can’t you just start over elsewhere?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Heather is silent for a moment. You think she’s trying to stifle a laugh, which would probably be the first time she’s done that in awhile. Gwen soon comes back saying she’s prepped the room. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t know, I’ve never met her.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Why couldn't you get the other guy?" Zal asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Bolt walks out the door and now it’s just you and Rook. <EOS>
<BOS> “Please do not summon me ever again. Goodbye my love.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What the fu--" he starts to say before seeing Mira’s blood dripping from the point of your sword. <EOS>
<BOS> You eat a bit of food, sharing scraps with the donkey, then arrange your cloak out as a blanket. Just thinking about the night ahead makes your back ache. You remember a night Ivani had cajoled you into sleeping out under the stars - you'd obliged her since being in love made all people do stupid things - even then, in the prime of life, you'd been sore for days. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?! Maybe we weren’t clear, but this shit is ending TODAY.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Such knowledge is too dangerous to be written.” <EOS>
<BOS> The two Bloody Talons are more amused than angry, but they haven’t lost interest. <EOS>
<BOS> “You know that it hasn’t. You have to learn other magic, not just the shadow stuff even if you find it easier. Layla, has he been practicing?” you ask, while Kol goes back to his book. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately, when you inquire in the main mess, you find that storytelling is not allowed. At least, not commercial storytelling for coin, by order of the High Mage. You wonder briefly why an independent Ocean Liner would take orders from the Academy, but soon find that almost a third of the passengers are mages, returning from a conference on Chochill. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sounds good. Well guess that’s it then. Glad I ran into you. Been awhile since we’ve worked together on something.” <EOS>
<BOS> You swallow. "I could use some clean, hot water." <EOS>
<BOS> “She’s going back home of course. Her time here is done, well for now it is anyway.” Mr. Reynolds says. <EOS>
<BOS> You go to sleep wondering if things are starting to look up for you. <EOS>
<BOS> "Hey! So what do you think?" He shouts and starts climbing down a ladder to meet you. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunate, but every city has its own rules. It just means you will need to find someplace private to perform. You decide to ask the rejected musician if he has any ideas. <EOS>
<BOS> “Is there one?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> You start to walk towards the city entrance, when Clyde can’t resist talking more shit at you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Expansion? Where?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you get to the village, which is fairly humble. It’s probably smaller than your old home of Teckleville. <EOS>
<BOS> "I feel - I have only begun to feel. Like time was stopped, and now it flows again. But I also fade." <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, yeah, I got it.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Now you start to wonder if you were MEANT to be here. <EOS>
<BOS> “Really should have thought about doing it before. I was just so concerned about keeping everyone together and happy, I neglected to remember that I’m supposed to be improving our position as leader, not just being content on survival. Anyway, I’m sure this will be something everyone can get on board with, well the majority of them anyway. And yes, since you came up with all this, you can still keep your activities to Klyton while you seek out potential new members. I know you won’t make a damn mess of things and generally keep your head down.” Tom remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah, I see. Well better safe than sorry. So how did your meeting with the Syndicate go?” <EOS>
<BOS> "An inn certainly sounds better than the sewers." Vaughn says. <EOS>
<BOS> Other than those two, you’re drawing a blank. It’s a little concerning that some big guy is looking for you though. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, it isn’t just her lack of skill and bitching that’s the problem since that you can deal with. It’s the fact that she’s way more maintenance than you thought she’d be and she’s been getting worse in that aspect. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re either going to have to mentally break the illusion you’re experiencing or drop the crown and give up on this prize. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fucking hell, do any of you losers at least KNOW any fucking pirates?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay. Well, I should get back. What are you going to do?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Where were you anyway? I looked for you for awhile.” <EOS>
<BOS> He’s right of course. The criminal element has been disorganized ever since the city pulled back from anarchy and Baroness Ludmilla Varsakken took power from her father Vlad and brother Farad (And most certainly had a hand in killing them both). <EOS>
<BOS> You crumple to the ground and Tanya starts to say something, but then stops and then starts again. <EOS>
<BOS> "Touched," some say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t see why not actually. I never actually betrayed them, however, your son is going to be a nice bonus. If I take him to my brother, I’m pretty sure I can get him to pull some strings so I don’t just get accepted but also a higher position in the Syndicate as well. So you see, this isn’t being a traitor, this is improving my situation in life, that’s what you did right?” <EOS>
<BOS> “He’s fine. Runs some trading post with his family in Spiderfang territory. He exchanges information for coin with me from time to time.” <EOS>
<BOS> After a week of travel, the caravan stops at an oasis. Rightly, "The" Oasis; it is unlike anything you have seen before or that the caravan has passed. It's more of a lake than a watering hole, the lush plants and palms carpet the sands for some distance, and the homes built around seem more permanent than the usual huts. <EOS>
<BOS> “You change your mind?” <EOS>
<BOS> Then, you see three, four bodies drop. The arrows lodged in their fallen bodies are like flags claiming territory. Soon, the Imperial soldiers identify the direction in which the ranged attack is coming from and start to mobilize that way. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well that's very interesting, but I was wondering if she was likely to give us any shit if we try to muscle in on the tavern. I mean are we going to have to take care of this bitch or not?" <EOS>
<BOS> “What?! That asshole was kicking your ass!” Annah exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> “So you’re a thief?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course you know how I get this, but it doesn’t stop you from taking the money anyway, you mean old bastard.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera mumbles more things about how she wishes you both could do everything all over. She then feels something against the side of her head. <EOS>
<BOS> "WEAK MINDED FOOLS!" You can hear Rifiv's muffled shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh. Okay, did you want the body disposed of too?" Vaughn asks. <EOS>
<BOS> "And they say the Crimson Talons are nothing but a menace to society. We gave this man his life back. Hell, we gave several folks their lives back. How many miners work for us now?" You say with a chuckle. <EOS>
<BOS> Hank wants to say more, but he just gives you a dirty look and walks off. With that bullshit out of the way, you head to your free room. Before you even get there, you see a woman lingering in front of the door. She doesn’t look like one of the college crowd that comes here now, or a merchant or possibly a wannabe bard. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe, maybe not, but again, I don’t see why we should be following you to do it. A lot of us are still going to get killed and for what? There’s no profit in this.” <EOS>
<BOS> "It was fun, but I think it's time for a change of scenery. Goodbye Zal, and good luck." You say and walk away. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s sounds fun!” Kol exclaims and happily walks off with her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah, here we are!” he says abruptly, arriving at an iron-bound door leading into a large well-appointed armory. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s different with you. You’ve got royal blood, so it’s at least more fitting for you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Bullshit. Anyways, youz wouldn’t have alerted the guards if youz wuz a better thief!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh so you think you can just fuck my woman and leave then?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, some of this still isn’t making any sense. Actually a lot of it, but this is a much different version of what was going to happen to me when I got back to Jicol. I was told you were going to kill me.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Never thought I'd get an easy chance to get you like this, you never leave that fucking inn." The man says in a nastier tone. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, sir.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well how about just a private celebration between us then?” Zalmora says and moves in closer to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “But…but all those girls. They all died.” <EOS>
<BOS> You put a lot of distance between yourself and Jenny’s house and eventually you manage to catch a carriage and go back to the Laughing Devil. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora takes your words in silence. She looks at you with a mixture of feelings and you can't quite tell if it's betrayal, anger, sadness or even relief. She just walks over to you and touches your face before leaving. <EOS>
<BOS> But you move on before they can decide whether to search the room or not. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well I’m hoping you’ll listen to me on this advice this time because it’s apparent that you’re bound for a path of destruction. At least if you go talk to her you’ll get that over quickly and who knows, maybe just MAYBE, you’re right about all this. In any case, I’m going to go see if there’s anyone around to play cards with.” <EOS>
<BOS> By night fall the inn has gotten a little quieter. Normally that's not the case, but you know there's some major party going on at the Madcap Tavern tonight so most of the rowdier folks are there. You decide this will be a good time to go check on Vaughn. <EOS>
<BOS> “You know me so well.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Heh, Warts is more of a outside ally. He’s actually spoken highly of you. As has Yinen. That’s why I’ve come to see you for myself.” <EOS>
<BOS> You draw your dagger and then throw a nearby cup on the small table at Ardan. He blocks his face and then swings his axe at you. <EOS>
<BOS> By the end of the first week, you've already spent 20 silver just trying to stay alive. Other travelers who didn't have the coin to spare have already been made to work like servants; they are forced to load and unload camels, set up the merchants canopy, fan the merchants and the richer members of the caravan, make supper, fetch water for the camels, brush the camels, and all manner of other mundane and arduous tasks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, and since I’m in a generous mood I’m going to LET you walk away from this, because Yrid said you weren’t the target.” Metzger remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> You follow Heather to her office, which of course resembles more of a lab, however its kept in a much more organized manner than when you were in Elder Flynn’s lab. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay. That’s a lot of confidence in me, boss.” <EOS>
<BOS> And that’s when you see Ardan’s broken body on a pile of rocks. This is a complete disaster. You feel sick and you actually throw up. <EOS>
<BOS> Wasting no time, you enter and the barrier closes behind you. Heather tells you to follow her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well how about just a private celebration between us then?” Zalmora says and moves in closer to you. <EOS>
<BOS> All religion save for the temple of Dorna are outlawed and anyone holding Joachimite beliefs is sentenced to death, putting a final end to the religious faction war in the city once and for all. <EOS>
<BOS> You aim for Gwen, but not a kill shot, instead you shoot just so the bullet whizzes in front of her face causing her to break her concentration and even stumble back a bit. Then you quickly address Tanya. <EOS>
<BOS> Perhaps some stories were not meant for crowds or public enjoyment, but intended to find their way into a single heart. <EOS>
<BOS> You briefly wonder if maybe you drank too much, but that definitely wasn’t it. You’d say it was the woman herself that was causing you to do that, but she didn’t seem like she wanted anything to do with you on that front. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah yeah sure! Just don’t say anything!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Take them prisoner. Enough blood has been spilled this day,” you order. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ardan? Never saw him. They must have been mistaken, though I’m surprised I never saw him.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you go to sleep figuring you’re going to need your energy for traveling tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> What’s really not helping is the Crimson Talons running around carelessly committing clumsy burglaries and heists and bringing the militia down even harder on everything. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure. Can’t you see the resemblance? Meh, I guess he does look a lot more like his mother Wendy. Anyway, not important. What is important is that Henry here has what they call a natural talent. He’s been honing it since he was a child, I was so proud when he finally sought me out to join the family business. Now, he might not be as big and strong as ol’ Olaf over there, but I guarantee he’ll get the job done.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Virgil! Virgil! Get up you old drunk! Got work for you and probably some free booze on top of it.” You exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> It takes a bit of stealth and hiding on your part (along with distancing yourself from Teckleville) but eventually as the sky goes dark, you’re fairly certain nobody from the town is still chasing you, or if they are, they might have made camp for the night. <EOS>
<BOS> “HEY! That’s my girlfriend, you asshole!” <EOS>
<BOS> “What about it?” <EOS>
<BOS> The only other place that comes to mind is Hessla which for one thing is a whole lot closer, but it also still has a reputation of being a haven for thieves, pirates, and other criminal types. At least it’s something you’d be familiar with. <EOS>
<BOS> “For my son, you murdering bastard!” you hear a deep voice say as a large figure rushes in your cell on top of you and you feel a blade go into your throat. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because Madeline pointed out that it might be better if we didn’t build everything in one place. Said it would be easier to keep the support structurally sound as well if we didn’t build too big. I think it’s coming along fine so far, though the ceilings are a little low. Guess goblins aren’t used to building them high though.” You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey Warts! Ya cowardly little grub, youz can come out now! Got da bastard!” you hear a gruff voice exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “Of your own, what would…” <EOS>
<BOS> "Meh, why not? Not like I got anything better to do." She says and starts taking her clothes off. <EOS>
<BOS> “I am? Wait. Where are you going?” <EOS>
<BOS> You never thought you’d ever be visiting where your father went to learn to be a doctor, but you aren’t going to miss Madeline accepting her diploma. You genuinely love her as your relationship has grown. You were a little concerned at first, but you found that while it isn’t perfect, you feel pretty comfortable with her. You even have vivid dreams about her. Almost so real that you aren’t even parted when you sleep. You’ve told her all about your life in Teckleville, and your family. She hopes one day that maybe she can meet them, especially your sister. (You still wonder about all of them from time to time) <EOS>
<BOS> "I don't think I can do the job sir." Rob blurts out. <EOS>
<BOS> "Hello, ladies," he says smoothly, and the two woman inside - likely servants, by their humble dress, giggle. "This is my aunt Regalia. She had a falling out with the woman in her tent and could use a place to ride for the rest of the caravan." <EOS>
<BOS> Ragar was the first, but he is not the last. I know you hear the voice. I can sense the power within you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I suppose that was a bit of forward thinking on your part then, because you’re probably right. Guess this is one of those rare cases where honesty was the best policy after all. Well I guess you and your little friends have finally gotten your pirate dreams out of your heads now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, fuck you and fuck this plan.” You say as calm as you can. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera sits back and you look at her face. It’s like all the color has drained from it and it’s at that moment you know, no matter what she tells you, she’s betrayed you. You’re just wondering if she’s going to admit to it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, you could try to escape I guess, but I’m betting you already figured the soldiers would easily run you down before you got very far. I suppose you could try to beg for mercy when you go before the judge, maybe even use your youth as an excuse. Depending on the judge, that MIGHT get you some time shaved off, but you’ll still be doing a lot of it…and I think I don’t have to warn you about the dangers of ratting out Flynt and whoever it was you were supposed to deliver to in the first place to try to save your ass.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why not? You spend most of your time walking around the city anyway when you’re pilfering pocket in your free time. Not saying that you have to be the one to speak with them, but you could bring it to Tom’s attention and I’m sure he’ll be receptive. I’m sure when we build up our numbers AND wealth we can start branching out a bit more again. Like property and fronts.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I wasn’t hidin’ ya idjit, I was pretendin’ to be hurt in a fall.” Warts shouts back. <EOS>
<BOS> You search for several minutes, passing and re-passing the muses, until finally you find her a bit apart from the others. She looks to be sleeping on a bench, her long hair unbound and toyed with by the breeze, not frozen like stone or wax. <EOS>
<BOS> "Maybe it's a delayed reaction. Like they figured she'd show up by now and because she hasn't, reality is setting in that she might not just be missing, but she might be dead." <EOS>
<BOS> Part of you wonders if maybe you should just move on from this city, but you really loathe the idea of travelling again and you aren’t sure where you’d go. Hessla maybe? <EOS>
<BOS> “Zal, you’re gonna fall!” <EOS>
<BOS> Even if he’s lying about being a friend of your father’s, dying a slow death in a cage is still a pretty horrible way to die just for stealing food. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh I wouldn’t worry about that, because you lot will be taking the lead anyway. Not about to have you bunch sneaking about behind us.” <EOS>
<BOS> “THIEF! DISCARD ME NOW OR FACE DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR YOUR GREED!” <EOS>
<BOS> You hear nothing, not even footsteps. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, maybe you have, or maybe you haven’t, but that really doesn’t matter. You’re going to be locked away with a lot of killers. Most of them a lot tougher and bigger than the likes of you. So just because you killed your girlfriend or mom because she pissed you off doesn’t mean you’re some hard man.” <EOS>
<BOS> Pefallis is a port city on the Island of Castille. It's often called "the Port of the World," since it lies at a central location between all the major landmasses: Redsand, Aselthorne, and Gormare, the three main northern continents; and Syphyr, the great continent that fills much of the southern hemisphere and rises diagonally into the north. Almost every long ocean journey crosses through Pefallis. <EOS>
<BOS> Niro found himself falling to the ground, and dreaming the dark dream too. A dream of a sunless world, forced to work below a metal ceiling, and of heeding god-like masters. A dream of a world without hope, without dreams, without stars. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, fuck this. You start walking down these tunnels and who knows what the hell is in store for you. For all you know Sneaks has traps set to collapse the damn things. <EOS>
<BOS> You hang your head down and stare at the floor of the cart, not really wishing to see any more of a city you aren’t going to be able to take advantage of. <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose. She also was Rook’s cousin, which probably saved me from him killing me. In any case, I’m having serious concerns about this attack.” <EOS>
<BOS> You stagger over to your pistol and nearly fall over just trying to pick it up. You look over at the duel and Tanya’s still holding her own, but the bastard’s shadow magic is giving him the edge. You try to aim, but you can’t get a clear shot and when you do, he’s already moved out of the way or you’re suffering from dizziness. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not talking about that, I’m talking about whatever it is that happened outside. I might be old, but my hearing isn’t. I heard shouting and several gunshots. I’m guessing that you had something to do with that. Hope you didn’t leave a mess right outside my door because the Jicol Watch rarely comes out this way to clean up anything.” <EOS>
<BOS> “He’s not the only one, now WE need to leave.” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s actually amazing you managed to fight your way out of this surprise attack like you did. Your headquarters is gone though and you can’t imagine that your businesses in the city are going to be around much longer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that’s still fucking old then, aren’t you like seventy?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ha ha. Fortunately for you, I enjoy doing that for free.” <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe she deserved her revenge, maybe you’ve just got a soft spot for her, or maybe you just can’t be bothered. Whatever the case, you won’t be chasing her down. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you’ve shot and stabbed enough people and the rest have either fled or cowering somewhere. All things considered, you haven’t been wounded too badly in all this. You guess you never lose your touch on some things. <EOS>
<BOS> “They didn’t just dig a tunnel into the Yellow Devil Den. They’ve dug tunnels all over the sewers. Mostly under them. Made it easier for them to get around without having to walk about in the actual sewers. They may have also dug some tunnels near your old head quarters…you know, you look very peaceful when you sleep…” Madeline says and goes to touch your face, but you stop her by grabbing her wrist. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thanks. I’m really going to do my best to make this work.” <EOS>
<BOS> The nightingale soared. The snow glistened, the pine trees chattered and swayed, and the glorious sunlight was warm on its feathers. On and on it flew, into the forest where it was born, seeking out half remembered paths until the cold of the shade drove it out again. He cast one look back towards the distant courtyard, where an inviting tasseled pillow sat inside the open, gleaming cage. The sundial beckoned him to return. <EOS>
<BOS> “Your school girl would go a lot faster if she was a REAL engineer and didn’t have to leave every once in awhile to go attend classes. And why are we building in two different locations again?” Zalmora asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Message? What message?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ay, youz still with me?” Warts asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe it isn’t that bad! I mean he’s still providing a share of the loot to us right?” Tom says hopefully. <EOS>
<BOS> Ardan grips his axe tightly after threatening you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I had to try. So is there an exact timeframe for this assault?” <EOS>
<BOS> “She doesn’t love me! If she did, she wouldn’t make me angry all the time!” <EOS>
<BOS> Madeline thanks you and you see her out the door. <EOS>
<BOS> The Galpatis Empire might be going through a “Golden Age” but from what you can tell life is pretty much the same here as it was in your time. The poor bastards are struggling to survive, the rich bastards are sitting on their fat asses reaping all the benefits and everyone in between is just trying to make their own way to be a rich bastard and avoid becoming one of the poor bastards. <EOS>
<BOS> “Also, this ritual is going to still take a little time, so I really hope you can last longer than two minutes. It’s not going to work at all if you’re releasing before I can even get the first incantation out.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ugh. This part is soooo boring! I dunno why you didn’t steal the jewelry, I liked some of those necklaces.” Annah exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> Your answer is met with a backhand to your cheek. <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile Heather stands behind the barrier doing something with her hands. When you realize she might be casting a spell, you get nervous. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora now puts her hand directly on your cock, which is definitely interested even if you claimed that you weren’t. <EOS>
<BOS> “All of the guards just left. I saw a couple of them speak to each other and then one called to some of the others and they all just collectively left. I couldn’t believe it myself. That’s why I was hoping you’d hurry up since who knows how long they’ll be gone.” <EOS>
<BOS> Tomorrow comes and you go back to the university to ply your trade without any incident this time. You don’t see Annah thankfully, but you’ve been keeping away from the female dorms and any popular gathering spots since that seems to be how she’s working the place. <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course you were right about him. Why do you think he still holds a grudge against you even though you’re staying away from Tanya? I mean in his case, I don’t think it started out that way…shit I HOPE it didn’t start out that way since he took her in when she was a young teenager, but in any case. Garrick has been in love with Tanya for a very long time now. He’ll never make a move of course, which is why I’m telling YOU that if you REALLY think you’ve got a shot with Tanya, then you need to just go talk to her, because the non-confrontational routine? Yeah that doesn’t work and it isn’t your style anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> This is really looking like the end for you, unless you can come up with something. <EOS>
<BOS> The road is just as empty as the plains you just left. You continue to keep aware of your surroundings by keeping an ear out for various sounds. You still have this idea that you’re suddenly going to hear Teckleville watchmen on horses galloping on your position. <EOS>
<BOS> “So I guess it is sex. (sigh) Move!” Annah remarks and takes over. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thanks. I’ll just be taking these today.” You say and pay the merchant for your food before leaving. <EOS>
<BOS> “But why?!?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I’m not saying I’m an expert, but I know that talking to Keira the way you’ve been telling me you’ve been doing isn’t going to win her over. I mean I’ve spoke with her and…” <EOS>
<BOS> You’ll just remain alert and keep an eye out this guy looking for you. Remain on your guard too, since you still don’t know if this man means you harm or not. Hopefully Virgil can tell you something later. <EOS>
<BOS> About five hundred years ago, however, the blood cult took an interest in it, and sent a hundred priests to capture it. It's been in their hands since, though the rumors about it vary. The guide tells you a few of the better ones. Some say it is merely a show - that they aren't nearly as wicked as they pretend, and the rituals are kept for a sense of community and as a tourist attraction. Others claim they are far worse than the darkest rumor, and that their blood power rituals are merely the tip of a ring of crime, slavery, murder, and horrific experimentation. The guide, like you yourself, holds to the theory that they are pretty much what they claim: a morally ambiguous cult that drinks blood, seeks power, and isn't above using some less legal means to meet their goals. <EOS>
<BOS> The screams of burning wizards are soon drowned out by another bellow of pain by Tanya when Gwen hits her with another blast of whatever magic she’s using. This time Tanya falls to one knee briefly, but it isn’t enough and now she’s heading straight for Gwen like an angry charging minotaur. Gwen however is surprisingly holding her ground and preparing another magic blast. <EOS>
<BOS> “Go ahead then.” Tanya says a bit defeated. <EOS>
<BOS> “As I said, you’ve got time. You can skip the foreplay.” Annah says and before you can reply, she’s kissing and getting on top you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because I’ve lived here all my life and never felt the need to travel. I’m happy where I’m at and SHE needs to be happy too!” <EOS>
<BOS> All it takes is one of them to get in a good hit. The bones in the left side of your face shatter as you go down to the floor from one of their punches. You try to get up, but the rest of your skull is crushed under a statue’s stone foot. <EOS>
<BOS> Klint at this point starts getting closer to you and raising his voice and you begin to take a more defensive stance. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, that’s great, I might be needing that soon, look I gotta talk to you. Garrick approached me a couple days ago.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Where would we go?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Is it striking only?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re back! And so quick! I hear lots of squeaking from that box you’re carrying. I trust you got them?” Dr. Gossey says. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s a big fucking difference! For one, the whores at least have a say in things.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sneaking around? But we’re going through the main gate!” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah I know, I told him that I didn’t think you’d be interested in joining…wait I hope you’re not mad at me for not telling you about having connections to the Guild. I assumed you probably knew somewhere in the back of your mind and I wasn’t supposed to be announcing that anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Uh huh, look I dunno what your problem is with me exactly but I’m not your enemy, we’re on the same damn side so…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well what the hell happened?” <EOS>
<BOS> You have no words. You just don’t. You thought dealing with the lowlifes that hang around the Welcome Mat was a chore, but it still pales in comparison to this. If this wasn’t a paying job, there is no way you’d deal with this. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah? Well I still say ya betta hurry up. A lot ain’t dat patient.” <EOS>
<BOS> No sooner have you entered the room and you’re about to ask Tanya about what she has planned, you see her taking her clothing off. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, some man with a shaved head and several burn scars on his face and hands was asking about you by name at one of our brothels. He said he knew you from the old days.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera. Before we continue, I’m going to have to ask you to disarm. I know that…” <EOS>
<BOS> Though that’s a riskier endeavor nowadays and would result in needing to re-organize things again. Might be better to stick with your current set up. It isn’t perfect, but it’s working. <EOS>
<BOS> “No I’m not actually.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, he’s in there boss. Hasn’t been too roughed up, like you said.” Marco says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not that I’m not flattered by the offer, but weren’t you part of the Syndicate AND the Guild? Seems suspicious that both were destroyed while you’re still here.” Another adds. <EOS>
<BOS> “Cuz, it’s the best way to get into Reginald’s house. He’s got a secret passage to it down here.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m in charge ain’t I? Y’know what your problem is? You thought you were going to manipulate me into doing whatever you wanted just because you threw a little pussy my way. And now you’re bitter that didn’t happen. If you really want control of the Talons, you could always challenge me Zal.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I mean you’re skilled at fighting, you can do all that shadow magic stuff. Bolt here obviously has his talents as a marksman. I mean I’ll help too, granted I’m not as good as you two, but I HAVE had experience in fighting a demon before…okay she was a half demon and I got lucky, but who knows I might lucky again. I’m just saying that the three of us are better equipped to fight a demon than the regular Syndicate members at other locations. I think they could benefit with at least some help from a Shadow Blade assigned to them.” <EOS>
<BOS> Toz at this point bids you goodbye and soon you go find Vera in the armory where she waits with several of your best fighters and your son. The pair of them are pretty happy to see you, even if Kol doesn’t quite know everything that’s going on. <EOS>
<BOS> You wait for Vera still pondering your decision. When Vera arrives and you explain everything, she of course has her own strong opinions on it. <EOS>
<BOS> If you were still alive, you probably wouldn’t have found it surprising that Annah cried over you for weeks apologizing that she got you killed. <EOS>
<BOS> You just hope she isn't TOO much like her daughter because... <EOS>
<BOS> “Grandmaster didn’t. His sister did and she brought me here.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I told ya, things are different now. Most of da assholes I didn’t get along with are dead in dat tribe and it’s takin’ a new look on things as it were. Most of da young hobs I’m suggestin, are orphans now anyway and like I said, I kinda know what it’s like not growin’ up with at least one parent so I think dey gonna…I dunno identify wit me more an’ youz don’t have ta waste yer time.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re going to bet that despite her threat, Gertrude is NOT going to risk shooting your son. Besides wanting him to advance her own status, she probably did develop some form of connection while she was baby-sitting and you’re not convinced she’s going to be that ruthless anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> You take your leave as quickly as possible. No sign of Annah, but then she always was good at making herself scarce whenever the shit really went down. <EOS>
<BOS> Prince Ragar looks to the piece of parchment laid on the altar. A long strand of dark hair falls loose from the tie behind his head, covering his eye. His lips mumble incoherent words as he finishes reading the scroll. <EOS>
<BOS> Brother Samuel does as he’s instructed. On top of the pedestal lies an open scroll. Samuel instantly recognizes the spell’s intent. “By the light, I’m to call him to this plane?” he wonders aloud. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, your mom is a hobgoblin? Who was your father then?” <EOS>
<BOS> "A witch with a shovel in a weight-loss program? Classic." <EOS>
<BOS> “…okay I’m not even going to ask why the hell you were in a garbage bin, but weird guys in red robes, secret passages…are you sure Reginald isn’t part of some fucking cult? I mean this is starting to sound a lot more complicated and dangerous.” <EOS>
<BOS> You spend months in a dungeon waiting for judgment. During those first few weeks you try to find a way to escape. When you never find an opening of any sort, you just give up. After all what would you escape to? You’re nowhere near home or anything else that you know. You are a man out of time. <EOS>
<BOS> Keira asks you a few questions about yourself, which you keep vague with half truths, misdirections and outright lies. You don’t want to discuss your real situation anymore than she wants to discuss Ardan. <EOS>
<BOS> You lock the door immediately and then you finally speak. <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re giving it to Vera hard, she still manages to surprise you. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” you say still distracted by the fact that you can’t believe you got robbed. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, the repercussions of wild dark magic being thrown around. This building might have some strong magic protection, but it didn’t do shit for the people inside.” <EOS>
<BOS> It's enough to buy the caravan ticket, and the merchants even let you sleep on the floor in a crowded room with other waiting passengers for a "mere" ten silver. <EOS>
<BOS> The pair of them duel while you lie there trying to gather your strength. You’re really woozy and weak. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera laughs a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> You keep your eyes on the Inquisitor (Who is still pretty visible in the dark due to his white robes) and unsurprisingly realizing he doesn’t have his magic advantage anymore, he runs away. Though you were expecting him to just start running down the street, instead he runs back in the house he was staying at. <EOS>
<BOS> Jake stops walking back to the Talon hideout and walks over to you. <EOS>
<BOS> You head to the Sultry Siren where you proceed to drink. You’ve never really drank too much before in the past, but given what you just let transpire, you feel like maybe the best thing you can do is block out your thoughts. <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh? Yeah, just deep in thought.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, but I’m still concerned about this.” <EOS>
<BOS> Kol smiles back and he seems to understand what the witch wants him to do. After a couple of fumbled tries, he repeats the same thing the witch did and sure enough he too very briefly blinks out of existence. Then he laughs about it. <EOS>
<BOS> “I guess so.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “For saving my life of course.” <EOS>
<BOS> At first you had thought the lapses were just the dawn of old age - you are over seventy - but they were all related to the Book of Tales, or to stories you told the people of Dreaming Village. You would speak a tale, and then not only would the words be lost forever - but you would find you couldn't recall what the story had been about a week later. After months of this, you began to hear rumors and complaints of others who were also forgetting - forgetting not just the stories they had heard, but the memories of the Muses or the dreams they had had in childhood before the Sacrifice had robbed the world of nighttime visions. Then, you woke one morning to find you couldn't remember the color of Ivani's eyes. <EOS>
<BOS> Doesn’t really hurt to have cooks, blacksmiths and the like around so you’ve assured that they will not be harassed as long as they pay the usual “protection tax.” While it’s not exactly a proper town, already people are starting to give it the name of Nightfall. You imagine the name is related to the Nocturnal League’s name as well as the deity that the temple was once dedicated to. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hrm. Glad ta hear it. Business is good fer me when Holgard isn’t in fucking chaos.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah, I’d hardly call the Black Hooks a major anything. They’re a gang of wannabes, but I guess you do have a point and everyone does have to start somewhere. Yeah, probably should try to recruit them now when they’re young and moldable. Might be good to have some more local people and bolster our ranks a bit more.” <EOS>
<BOS> You walk over to her, as she crawls away from the liquid mess she’s left on the floor. She turns over and sits on the floor with her knees to her chest and her back against the wall. She looks at you and then starts to cry. You can hardly believe this is the same woman you once trusted with your life. <EOS>
<BOS> It was just one. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah the Talons were once in the drug trade. Not sure why we stopped really. I think the new leader at the time Tom wanted to step away from it since it drew too much heat. Then again Yellow Devil causing addicts to melt would certainly that. Sort of figured when Jake took charge we might get back into it, but still a bit too organized for him I think. Honestly I think he would have just preferred leading a gang that ambushed travellers on the roads.” <EOS>
<BOS> You jump from the cart and into a group of passing citizens, which happily prevent you from falling directly into the cobblestones. You quickly get up off the mass of bodies and start running. <EOS>
<BOS> You know he’s been trying to gain more help from the Temple of Fel, but that’s been having mixed results mainly due to the fact that while they may all worship the same God of Shadows, the pure dedicated followers don’t necessarily share the same goals as the Ebony Claw. <EOS>
<BOS> You need to get out of here before you kill everyone at this party with your cursed dick. The problem is you aren’t sure if you’re even going to make it that far. <EOS>
<BOS> “We have to be fucking inside a magic circle to be precise. That’s to keep us safe. Heather’s going to be there the whole time doing her magic thing of lifting my curse. I know it’s weird, but that’s how the spell works I guess.” <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s fucking right Garrick, you CAN’T fucking help! Nobody can! So stop playing the over protective dad role trying to save his little girl and just get the hell out of my quarters.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I will make a great king,” Prince Ragar affirms. “My father’s atrocities must be stopped.” <EOS>
<BOS> You run towards Heather and another cannon explosion hits not far from you. The force is enough to throw you to the ground and you’re pelted by bits of debris. With your head now bleeding and feeling dizzy, you slowly stand back up only for another nearby explosion to knock you back down again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well if you want a blowjob, then you can pay half that price, but if you want to know what that guy wanted, it’s ten silvers.” <EOS>
<BOS> “There’s not many of us -- a good thing, too, since this place would be unmanageable with a high number. This is the place for people who have no home, no king, no Emperor.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I know you got other customers, I’ll get up in a second, I just gotta catch my breath for a moment.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> The taverns… <EOS>
<BOS> “Good different or bad different?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shhhhit...” you quietly say which causes a snicker from Sneaks. <EOS>
<BOS> It's here that you finally look down. You're not too far up now, probably a few hundred feet, still not a height you'd survive falling from. The mountainside transitions into a thick forest. The tree-littered hills roll off in the distance, with only a few mountains poking up overhead. If you weren't inches away from death, you'd enjoy the view. Satisfied at your arm strength, you continue the journey down. <EOS>
<BOS> Richard and Seth exchange looks, unsure how to handle the situation. Seth walks to you and places a hand on your shoulder, comfortingly. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s brimstone. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, well things are tough all over." <EOS>
<BOS> “So, what are you going to do? Shoot them all?” <EOS>
<BOS> However she said that she was given permission to accept Peter’s deal for you, so as far as he knows, you’re on his side. <EOS>
<BOS> “An wez lost a few purple wish houses and sum gambling dens too. Hopefully we can save da rest before we don’t have anything left.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…hysterical. Later Warts.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So you see? I haven’t been avoiding a relationship with you for no damn reason. I’ve been trying to keep you alive! And if you want to stay that way, I’d suggest you fucking leave right this minute. I need to go jerk off or something in an alley right now.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ardan is NOT my husband.” <EOS>
<BOS> "It isn't your position to ask questions." The commander sighed from behind him, "just, keep going." <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not exactly friends with anyone here. Ever since your wife had me looking after your son, she keeps me isolated from the rest of the slaves. If anything they probably dislike me more for having better living conditions. Sir, I swear to Ahmed I will not say anything you say or do if you don’t wish it. My situation is very dire compared to my previous life, but I certainly don’t want it to get any worse by angering you or your wife.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course not. Well good luck kid, wherever your endeavors take you.” Tom says and with that you exit the hideout and the door slams behind you leaving you back in the sewers. <EOS>
<BOS> "I suppose I hadn't considered the long history," you say with a drawn out sigh. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately for you your actions have already attracted attention and the day before you're about to leave, you are suddenly seized by the Hessla Headsmen who burst in the room you're staying at. Six of them in fact, though it only takes two of them to hold you down as they shackle you. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, so the Broken Glass owner says he'll comply." Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Whatever shadow magic tricks he was using have fooled you completely as the shots pass right through the false image and into the solid oak door. You then feel two sharp blades thrust hard into your back. You crumple to the floor instantly. <EOS>
<BOS> Your mouth opens, and a piercing scream emits. The world before you turns a dark, primal color as you take the role of hunter. Strength pours into your limbs unlike anything you’ve felt before. Not even the training “unlocking” the Unbroken feels like this. It’s exhilarating, like pure nirvana. With your heightened senses, you view the battlefield before you with clarity. It’s as if you know the exact outcome of each action before it happens. You start to shout commands to your men and then... <EOS>
<BOS> You’re just about to head up to the second floor and that’s when you hear a groaning noise. You look back, but you already know what you’re going to see. <EOS>
<BOS> You turn around and fire from your prone position, but Bolt once again blinks out of sight. Having the disadvantage again, you now duck behind Rook’s desk and attempt to push his body aside. <EOS>
<BOS> Plus it doesn’t hurt that she’s attractive and has a pleasant personality. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, and since there’s no other way to say it, I’m going to just be right up front with you, like you were up front with me.” <EOS>
<BOS> Once again searching your memory again of your sister’s old stories, you think you’re seeing Galpatis. Or at least some portion of the old empire. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well not as such no, but I certainly wouldn’t be one to piss any of his faithful off.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What, weirder than this?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m also guessing you’ve probably got a small fortune hidden away like one of those dragon stories of old.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Always?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Anything else?” <EOS>
<BOS> “DAUGHTER OF NEROTH FINISH OFF THIS INFIDEL AND EMBRACE YOUR TRUE NATURE AT LAST!” Reginald shouts above the rest of the chanting. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, well off you go with Layla then.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay stop that!” <EOS>
<BOS> "Hey boss, can you spare a copper?" He asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I have been doing my best in seeing to it that Kol here is practicing his…erm, shadow magic.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah. The militia. If only it was that simple. No, it’s a little more complicated than that, but no you shouldn’t be worried. However, if Madeline comes by tell her…tell her that I didn’t have a choice and to move on. Okay?” <EOS>
<BOS> Those on the silver squares, such as Crash Velvet, represented the Imperial advisors and officials. Those on the red squares, the nobles and extended members of the royal family. And one, beginning on a central 4 square patch of green, stood for the Emperor. Rom taught them Emperor's circle, and how each horse would vie for the Emperor's favor. But they not only sought to win for themselves, but had to work as a team to employ the best moves to draw the Emperor into their web. <EOS>
<BOS> Looking at the newer maps posted by the booking windows, it looks like the fasted route would be to take an Ocean Liner to Stone City in Aselthorne. But checking prices around the docks is disheartening - you'll need 300 silver, minimum, to make such a journey. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? What is it?” <EOS>
<BOS> She grabs you and throws you against the wall very hard. <EOS>
<BOS> As you stitch up another patient, the mage says: <EOS>
<BOS> “I…don’t know.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> You lunge for the pistol. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh no…” you say when you see her eyes starting to water. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not young, I’m a grown man!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> You remember how hostile she was towards you for years, but now she only ever looks at you with affection. You must have told your mundane stories about your life in Teckleville more than a few times to her, but for whatever reason she seems to enjoy them. Maybe it’s due to her own childhood being less fun since despite everything you didn’t really have it all that bad. In fact if you’d just obeyed the rules, you would have had a pretty easy life. (You certainly wouldn’t be in this situation) <EOS>
<BOS> “The same mayor that allows pirates and the like to use his docks? Please, the mayor is no fucking Joachimite saint. We moved all of our shit out of Jicol and now we’re doing the job that YOU lot couldn’t. We’re almost done with finishing off these assholes, we just need to clean out this place and get their leader.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Not gone, but it’s currently under construction. Trying to turn it into a proper place to train any future agents. Bunch of dwarves there right now, and they aren’t fond of anyone getting in the way of their work. Warts suggested getting goblins since it would be much cheaper, but I figured the extra money would be worth sturdier construction.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I love you.” <EOS>
<BOS> You figure it’ll take them at least a month or two before they figure out something has gone wrong when they don’t return. You’ll have time to prepare at least. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point the pain is becoming more of a numbness and your vision is beginning to blur. Out of the corner of your eye, you see a green figure bend down to pick up something, most likely the pistol you dropped when you triggered the trap. <EOS>
<BOS> “There has to be a catch. I mean if he’s well off and a special friend of the Baron’s son, then he’s gotta have connections and protection.” <EOS>
<BOS> Strange. They shouldn’t have known Seth and his raiding party were coming. You voice that to the man. <EOS>
<BOS> Gertrude leaves while Vera goes to put Kol (Who has fallen asleep during all this) in his basket. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey boss, I saw you come back. What’s going on?” Vaughn suddenly asks walking in you. <EOS>
<BOS> Captain Rifiv is using a telescope to look past the nearby mermaid infested waters in the hopes of finding some sort of land. Meanwhile most of the crew is busily filling their own ears with wax. <EOS>
<BOS> “Give up,” she says, holding an aggressive stance. <EOS>
<BOS> When word of Rook being dead spread, remnants of ECS members that had been assigned to the slave market just stayed there and went into business for themselves. Some of the other members joined soon after. It’s one of the few things that the Holgard Watch has not been efficient in eliminating. Though the location never was known to general law enforcement anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re welcome!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Somebody was lookin’ fer ya.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Go on ahead, I'm almost done, I'll be right behind!" You say waving Vaughn away. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hardly a problem. I can pick the lock.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Good. Good. Glad to see a young person thinking about their future. Hey, would you consider yourself to be an adventurous spirit?” <EOS>
<BOS> A draft slipping in through the window stabs at you. You clutch your cloak and ponder. The air feels heavy. The story lingers in your mind, even as your innards church, signaling the tale has been lost. But has it? The story felt different, somehow. Alive. Like you weren't making up a story at all, but accessing the deep memory of the world itself. <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t sure how this magic circle shit works, but you can’t think of anything else to do except try to pull Gwen out of it. And to your amazement it actually works. <EOS>
<BOS> One of which is killing the head of this cult that’s been trying to kill you. It’s odd that you feel so strongly about this given that the EC was trying to kill you for years, but then maybe that’s because you knew the EC was an enemy that from you can gather is much bigger than you could ever hope to fight. You consider it a victory that you even managed to get them to stop attacking you though you know you’re going to have to deal with them again eventually. You just don’t know how yet. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, well I am the nice one. Now get the hell out of here.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You mean the new up and coming cutpurse with the cute face and nice ass? She got a bolt to the head a week ago. Found dead in an alley. Damn shame, she had a lot of potential. Fucking tragic.” <EOS>
<BOS> You slowly walk into the dimly lit foyer with your weapon drawn. You search the downstairs cautiously and methodically, but don’t find any one. In the back of your mind you wish this was just a simple breaking and entering job because you’re seeing a lot fancy decoration and you’re sure Reginald has more portable valuables laying around in a safe or something somewhere. <EOS>
<BOS> "Okay fearless leader. I'm sure Vaughn will be happy to hear we're staying together for his sake." Zal chuckles. <EOS>
<BOS> Zamed pulls his pistol and you fire landing one right between his eyes as promised. However this isn’t enough to deter the rest of his men who rush at you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Still tastes alright ta me.” Warts says <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, here you go…so what do you want to do now?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I know how I feel, and I can make good guesses on your feelings, but it’s never a sure thing you know? But I’m happy to have confirmation. In any case, I go where you go. We’ll start over in Jicol and be successful, in fact I’ve already got my own ideas about what can get us a good head start…” <EOS>
<BOS> Warts nods at your confidence which you return before he takes his leave. <EOS>
<BOS> “Meh, maybe he has it elsewhere…doesn’t matter, what matters is he’s going away for a long damn time.” <EOS>
<BOS> “The Emperor will deal with you. It’s my honor to die in his service,” the Commander says, charging forward. <EOS>
<BOS> “Do you need more information? He gave me the name of the person I was supposed to deliver to! Someone named Crasnov that runs a pottery shop in Sivak!” <EOS>
<BOS> Going "legit" isn't really going to be as easy as Zal is making out though. You would take a much severe loss in profit than perhaps she thinks. Maybe you could make it, but it wouldn't come easy. You'd have to work hard, but then you work just as hard now and have the constant paranoia added to it. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s one thing to rob the odd merchant here and there, but when enough of them were going missing, the Baroness had no choice but to step in. And she stepped hard. <EOS>
<BOS> The link broken, you gaze at her dulling form, her hair falling heavily over her eyes and losing its color. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya’s stance towards you softens a bit, but not by much. She doesn’t even apologize; she just leaves the ruined house you were meeting her in and takes to the air. She apparently has decided to give absolutely zero fucks about being seen anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> "Ivani," you whisper. "I've come. After all these years, I'm here." You stroke her hair. It's as vibrant and youthful as it ever was, only highlighting the age of your own knobby hands with their swollen blue veins and spots. <EOS>
<BOS> "What?!" You exclaim in disbelief. <EOS>
<BOS> You never put it together based on the vague descriptions by other people before, but you know who this man is. He’s Klint’s father. <EOS>
<BOS> Zamed’s eyes glaze over at the fortune he stands to make from all this. <EOS>
<BOS> “We should not be overconfident. We have nowhere to run should the empire find a way inside.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No dad. Just the man.” Kol says. <EOS>
<BOS> “What happens if I don’t get there in six days?” <EOS>
<BOS> You silently acknowledge Rook’s words. While this is certainly going to help you out, you’re not sure if you’re going to be able to afford all these “favors” when it comes time to pay up. <EOS>
<BOS> What the hell, moving on is all part of the healing process. <EOS>
<BOS> One of the militia men is firing at you from the top of the hatch. Seeing that Vaughn still has his own pistol holstered, you grab it, point upward and fire. You somehow manage to hit the guy in the face and then you realize the folly of that as you desperately roll out of the way of his falling body. <EOS>
<BOS> Doesn’t stop you though and you continue until you (and her) are completely spent. <EOS>
<BOS> He denies it and so it goes back and forth though a couple of the others back up the accuser. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. Well you shouldn’t cover them, I find them to be cute.” You say trying to bring a little levity to the situation. <EOS>
<BOS> “As you say…well in any case I certainly hope you’re as chummy with the Baroness as you’re supposed to be, because this little fight did attract attention and last I heard any open fighting between the religious faiths was frowned upon. Not to mention the League was involved and I certainly down want repercussions of this to cause my organization to suffer for it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re just full of them boy and you’ll be paying for them soon because your luck has finally run out.” Walford says from his desk <EOS>
<BOS> “Tom said some pretty interesting things about you.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Guess you’re right. So what do you want?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you ready for the Grand Melee?” Kassi asks running up to you. <EOS>
<BOS> The shock causes you to panic because now this doesn’t feel like an illusion. You immediately drop the crown believing that it might correct things, but all that happens is the crown starts falling to the ground too. <EOS>
<BOS> You join the early morning crowd in the town square. A few shop stalls are open for business, although you have everything you should need for now in your pack, and townfolk mill about picking over the wears. A few children run here and there, but most of those are the shop assistants. More will soon come once the typical breakfast hour is over. <EOS>
<BOS> You then turn to Layla. <EOS>
<BOS> “My part is over here. Politics don’t interest me. I didn’t come all this way to rule over my fellow man. I saw evil and had to act. The Empire is no more, and perhaps we can live in a peaceful time. I’ve witnessed the good of man, along with the darkness that can inhabit one’s heart. Ellehorn forest you say? Nature has always been a welcomed ally, which is more than I can say for the city here.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well don’t you want back up?” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s a big ass sewer and they’re the Thieves Guild not the Holgard Watch. Dey don’t exactly patrol da place. They’re all most likely up top breaking into shit. Besides, I told ya, they ain’t the ECS. They aren’t very territorial anyway. Dat’s why we can walk around here without as much concern…well except for giant rats and such.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, actually my father doesn’t speak much about Klyton or the past at all. He prefers to forget it. Says it was mostly stressful.” <EOS>
<BOS> And with that, you’re on your way out of Klyton and on the road to Hessla. Right now though you’re just trying to adjust your eyes to all the damn sunlight. It’s been awhile since you’ve been up this early. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, there’s twenty vials of Blue Dream in here.” A slightly more decorated man remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> "For an object? Something like an egg?" <EOS>
<BOS> You explain that the pair of you should head to the magic school right away so you can get on with your lives together so that’s exactly what you both do. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, we once were. The truth is, even by the time I got involved with his organization, it was on the decline. Still had the vicious rep at least though, maybe a bit too vicious since it probably encouraged Klyton’s crackdowns and tightening up of security. Things just got worse over the years as more skilled members got arrested, killed or just quit for better pastures.” Tom explains. <EOS>
<BOS> You head back into Grayhaze’s shop as you continue to attempt to calm Kol down. Doesn’t take long before she comes out of the back to see what’s going on. <EOS>
<BOS> First things first, you need to get rid of Hank. The guy is too far gone now to run this place properly and even if you could get him clean, you wouldn’t exactly have a hold over him anymore. In fact, he’d probably start trying to reassert himself again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright watch it, pimples.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I don’t need details on that part.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re living here and you expect me to believe that?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I appreciate it. This is something that’s been a long time coming. Honestly, it was foolish to believe they wouldn’t be a problem. Shadow Master Shade warned me to always watch them you know, just before he died. A few of his interpretations of the faith may have been a bit too restrictive, but he had his own wisdom on practical matters.” <EOS>
<BOS> First thing you notice is you’re stark naked, laying on a bed and it’s incredibly hot. The room you’re in is fairly nice, so you have to be someplace upscale. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re fairly certain the driver had to have fallen off. If he didn’t die, you’re going to finish the job. You aren’t sure about Elana, chances are she’s alive and still in the carriage, but if she insists on getting mouthy like she’s been with you before, you’ll teach her a lesson too. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh, fine. You can come in. But that creature stays out. You can tie him in the shed." <EOS>
<BOS> And she’s gone again. This time forever. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s the same name I’ve heard a few times.” <EOS>
<BOS> Your defiant words aren’t something she hears very often, at first she looks surprised, even slightly hurt, but then that turns to anger very quickly. <EOS>
<BOS> “Let’s just say, Olaf USED to have an equally bad ass barbarian buddy by the name of Silence. Silence didn’t like it when he lost a staring contest to Scales and things got violent. Olaf and Silence were best friends and Olaf didn’t even ATTEMPT to attack Scales when he ripped out Silence’s throat in five seconds. He just left the room and I can’t be certain, but I think he might have even cried. Of course nobody was going to ask. Olaf certainly brutalized folks more than average in the fighting pits over the next few days after that though.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you wake up, you find yourself in a cell, which look very familiar. It should, because you’ve been in it before. You’re at the Teckleville jail. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ew. No. And you wish.” Annah says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Flashy one? You’re the one with the big fancy house! And you got a job with the government now? I’ve even heard Hero of Holgard used by some people in this city! Never thought I’d ever hear your name and hero used in the same sentence.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, I’m thirsty. Alright NOW let’s go.” <EOS>
<BOS> A few tradesmen wandering the docks hawk their wares. They might not be classy, but they should be well connected. You could probably sell a sheet of remembrance paper here to gain some extra coin. <EOS>
<BOS> When you get back, you’re about to go straight to Tom who is in his office, but before you can Zalmora stops you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh? Yeah, just deep in thought.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit! Yinen! He’s still in the fucking cage back there, we need to let him out.” You say as you’re putting on the robe. <EOS>
<BOS> And with those words Tanya slowly steps out of the circle to Heather’s horror. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I guess I better head out.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s a long shot, but you think about the possibility of some valuable items still here. Temples usually have that sort of thing lying around. You might as well take a look given that you’ll be spending the night here. <EOS>
<BOS> You wait until the middle of the night and then make your way back to the apothecary, which you easily break into. <EOS>
<BOS> Brother Samuel’s gaze meets the Grandmaster’s gray eyes. “I’m sorry. I had to know,” he breaks the silence. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya however, was correct that in time you’d “get over” her. Maybe not mentally (You can’t help but think about her still) but physically you definitely did. <EOS>
<BOS> In your dazed state you feel yourself being dragged into a nearby alley. You attempt to stop your assailant, but are only met with more stomps to your face. He only stops in order to take out his flintlock pistol. <EOS>
<BOS> With so many standing up to the League, it’s harder to maintain the natural fear you were instilling in the population. Relying on more brutal methods to keep people in check works, but unfortunately you can’t collect money from the dead and the violence from your organization is getting so bad that even the normally corrupt Holgard Watch has to step in to maintain some semblance of order and you begin to lose business. <EOS>
<BOS> You make your way down to street level again, open the gate (which the guards helpfully left unlocked) and go to the front door which you lockpick with ease. You’d think even with the guards he would have gotten a better lock, but whatever makes your task easier. <EOS>
<BOS> He’d been in many platoons led by captains with little care for their armor, or their men for that case. He will be different, though. The Captain pulls the headband from his forehead, letting his wavy brown hair fall in his face. No, he would be better than the shit-for-brains leaders he’s served under. The first step is looking the part. Easy enough. The second step, the one that will dictate the lives of his men, is a lot more difficult. <EOS>
<BOS> “The drugs? Well Green Lotus or a milder form of it is legal here now, so that’s out. Yellow Devil as far as I know was never a big money maker due to it having a major chance of causing the user’s innards to melt and bleed from every orifice. Of course Blue Dream is the big one nowadays, but the Ebony Claw Syndicate mostly has a monopoly on its production and distribution. None of us knows how to make it or has connections. But then drugs have never been an interest of mine. The Talons actually did control a few whorehouses at one time, until government shut them all down and then built some nicer, fancier and Klyton run ones. Being a whore has never been more respectable. Okay, maybe not. But the point is, the Klyton Council effectively destroyed the Talons by legalizing shit and taking it over more than they ever did with just the militia.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well I might do better in prison than you think…” you say and then you whisper…”I’ve killed someone before.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Damnit, it’s a full on assault! Take this asshole to the dungeons, the rest of you get whoever that is and be on the look out for others!” Reginald orders. <EOS>
<BOS> “Then why did you let me in?” <EOS>
<BOS> You have no words. <EOS>
<BOS> Along the way, a man with a full beard and mustache and raggedy clothing comes up to you. <EOS>
<BOS> "Then my time will soon be over. Do not fear for me, love, their desire is not without reason. Stories, dreams, memories - without us, they will all return." <EOS>
<BOS> “Warts, what the hell?” you ask <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh we have a shy one do we? I must say, you shouldn’t be, given your body. However, as much as I would love to throw you over the altar in front of my congregation and introduce my dick to your ass while slitting your throat as I released, I’ve got something better planned for you.” Reginald remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Brother Samuel stands still for a few moments and then begins to feel uneasy. The thought pops into his head that the wisp could have let him into a trap. He checks the hallway for movement. Nothing. Suddenly, the bookcase swings open and Samuel is face to face with the wisp. <EOS>
<BOS> The area was already half destroyed from the initial attack and pillaging, but with Heather’s recent attack on his fleet, Peter is determined to destroy the entire harbor and then some. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh?” you answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, good.” You say and then enter the room. <EOS>
<BOS> You half wonder if you hallucinated her, but you see that there is a discarded mask so you’re guessing she was actually here. <EOS>
<BOS> While Tanya has her worries about your sex life together, you’re actually feeling a bit more positive about all this. Tanya’s concern for your well-being at least shows she’s not going to eat your soul anytime soon. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’d think that would probably be creepy, but considering what she is, you can’t say you’re all that surprised. Besides, she went to the trouble to go get you food. <EOS>
<BOS> “What, really?” <EOS>
<BOS> And with that, the big rusty lock makes a satisfying click and you back away from the cage. <EOS>
<BOS> The window still had jagged glass bits around the edges and when Jenny’s boyfriend pulled you, you naturally got scraped on most of those. Wouldn’t have been so bad due to your protective clothing, but then you caught a sharp piece against your unprotected neck while getting pulled and unfortunately sliced open an artery. <EOS>
<BOS> Fortunately, Captain Rifiv was so paranoid about them from last encounter that he made everyone carry some with them at all time. <EOS>
<BOS> Shade also mentions that looks are very deceiving however on the external security front. Shade says it took all of his willpower to keep up his shadow magic to remain undetected (And apparently years off his life given that he looks older than he should now), but he learned that the Inquisitor has been using similar illusionary magic to make Joachimite fanatics invisible as well. Several of these invisible holy warriors are just laying in wait in case of an attack. <EOS>
<BOS> You attempt to negotiate slightly cheaper prices, but the shopkeeper just laughs. You sigh at your light purse and make your selection. <EOS>
<BOS> Not questioning your leadership again, your people follow you. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not trying to assassinate you if that’s what you’re thinking, I just wanna talk to you a little more privately so we aren’t interrupted.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No it isn’t.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I…I don’t want to talk about it, look we need to get the fuck outta here. I don’t like it here and I don’t…feel right just being here. We need to fucking go NOW.” <EOS>
<BOS> You realize you’re not nearly as fun loving as you used to be when you were younger. In fact, you’re downright stodgy at times. All you practically do is fucking work. Being a criminal isn’t fun anymore, it’s actually not even dangerous at this point, it’s just well… mundane. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, so big guy in his forties was looking for me. What did he want?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Zal is not manipulating me.” <EOS>
<BOS> Rook is just shaking his head as he tosses one of the books aside. <EOS>
<BOS> "Erm, I mean dealt with her. She won't be a problem." <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, I’ve cased the high class rich area several times and the homes got security up the ass. The aristocrats got more watchmen on their payroll than the average merchant. I know I’m no slouch, but if I can get enough coin with lower risk targets, why take the fucking chance? Besides, I’m trying to keep a low profile anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> “But…oh shit…” <EOS>
<BOS> And fortunately for you today some of them are answered. <EOS>
<BOS> “Camid?” <EOS>
<BOS> “You mean like you?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I guess so…sheesh…well I guess it’s just as well. Not like they’re going to ever see me again.” <EOS>
<BOS> You send the letter off and have no idea if it’ll ever actually reach them and even if it does, you probably won’t ever get an answer back, but you feel better about making the attempt. <EOS>
<BOS> As you and Tanya spend time together in your dream, somewhere else in your mind is concerned with just how much danger you’ve put yourself in being a mole in the Ebony Claw Syndicate. Never mind the fact that you’ve got an increasingly more powerful half succubus that can access you in your dreams now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Or maybe you made them look like they were. It’s Holgard, not like the Watch was going to double check for barmaids and whores.” <EOS>
<BOS> While the whole point of being a criminal is to not pay taxes to begin with, you do see the potential here. It really couldn’t hurt to have some shadow priests indebted to you especially if Peter invades. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes! I proved them all wrong. I thrived on the hate, their hate, my hate, all of it. I used it to achieve greatness. I am now a general in the Infernal Legions! I have personally beheaded and carved up celestials and won battles against seemingly impossible enemies. I am no mere succubus. I am a personification of rage, war, and hate.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah fuck that, it’s absolute chaos out there. Surprised the Baron’s managed to still keep control of some of the city. Mostly the merchant’s district, rich areas and his palace of course, but it’s getting worse. To be honest, I would leave the city, but unfortunately I’ve still got a streak of loyalty and I’d never just abandon Garrick. Too much history, even if I don’t agree with him sometimes. Anyway, see you later and good luck.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Not to mention I don’t even know you.” You add. <EOS>
<BOS> “He might, but I’m not particularly worried that he will. Right now he’s got proper fear in him and he’ll get the rest of the Black Hooks in line with the League. They’ve been following him this long so they’ll listen and in time his influence will be less as we split them up and have them work with other people. I mean yeah I could have shot him, but I think not killing him was the better play in the long run.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. Sorry to hear it. Um, well I guess I’ll take Patricia then.” <EOS>
<BOS> “BARON PETER.” <EOS>
<BOS> You secretly smirk at things going your way for a change and lay down thinking about what you’re going to do with your new exiled life tomorrow. Probably the same thing you were going to do before, except without Annah tagging along. Sure, she helped you out, but you can see that relationship is just doomed to cause more problems than you need. (Like this incident!) <EOS>
<BOS> “Gruh, fine by me. I certainly don’t wanna go. I gotta go see my kids anywayz, later.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Those always did come in handy for blackmail.” <EOS>
<BOS> "There's a bum who used to be an engineer? What the hell happened?" <EOS>
<BOS> Then just when you think everything is settled with this situation, disaster strikes. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well, now it’s a concern. I mean I just don’t see it ending well if he falls in love with her. I mean either we have to get rid of her permanently which might end badly. Or we’d have to accept her and even free her which again might be her plan.” <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Virgil mumbles and stumbles away still mumbling and swearing. <EOS>
<BOS> “What I’m getting at is that while what remains of our temple may still hold Fel’s dark wisdom, the truth is, we cannot possibly continue as a congregation here. Our temple has started to fall into decay. The baroness who once was a dabbler in our faith has even abandoned us. We got a message not too long ago about a new law taxing religious organizations, which we can’t pay of course. Of course if we don’t, the government is going to just demolish our temple to build a new inn there or something.” <EOS>
<BOS> The five farspan trek outside of town to the Fortress takes most of the day, but fortunately the brooch is very light and portable. You approach the guards at the gate with confidence. Two others are also there, having their gifts inspected. <EOS>
<BOS> “So, I hear you know Mr. Scars and he told you to speak with me. If that’s true then you’ll have something important to tell me. If not…well you’re going to get the privilege of learning exactly why they call me Ponyride.” <EOS>
<BOS> But how? How can you capture a dream? <EOS>
<BOS> You manage to make it to your room, as just as you do, Annah grabs your ass, scaring the hell out of you. <EOS>
<BOS> “So…I was right about Garrick?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I can’t help but notice you lot seem to be talking about me.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera kisses you and you’re soon on your way to one of the brothels. <EOS>
<BOS> You take a seat in the back with your drink and enjoy the musicians currently on the stage. In the old days you probably would have preferred to spend your off time at a brothel, but you’re starting to get to a point where you’re not even missing sex any more. Which is a bit worrying on a certain level. Maybe you need to seek out new help on this situation. Maybe give your agents a new side mission of contacting the magic schools. Delantium and Klyton both have one after all. While your feelings for Tanya have certainly diminished over time, she’s certainly always going to be in your thoughts thanks to this curse. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah makes “Squeee!” sound and then kisses you saying how exciting it will be to finally go to the “Big City.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Pfft, I’ve seen what that shit does to people. No way I’d give it to Swifty here.” You say picking up your not so small rodent creature and petting him a couple times. <EOS>
<BOS> “What seriously?” <EOS>
<BOS> "If we are fighting the muses, why are we taking it out on the forest?" he asked as his fellow soldiers cut trees and trampled bushes. <EOS>
<BOS> Knowing what’s really going on, you waste no time in firing at Heather while your hobs rush forward to attack. <EOS>
<BOS> Having no other choice, you attempt to play it dumb and make gestures that you don’t understand them. It isn’t really a plan, so much as it’s the lack of one since you really can’t understand them. Though eventually when they get exasperated enough, you understand them all too well. <EOS>
<BOS> “BURN IN THE PURE LIGHT OF JOACHIM! THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM HIS TRUTH!” <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sigh) Well I hate to bring this up, but I have thought of a diplomatic solution which might be possible.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, well that fine that you’re discovering shit about yourself. Personally I don’t give a shit, but I’ve gotten very comfortable here and I’m saying I don’t want to pay any fucking rent and if you try to make me, you aren’t going to have to worry about if I’m going to blab about your sexual habits, you just won’t be getting any more Numb. I got other customers and there are always other places I can find to live.” <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re racking your brain on how to deal with this new situation, you get another visitor. <EOS>
<BOS> I never forgot that night you threw me out. I never forgave it either. And fuck your lame ass apology you tried to give earlier about it. <EOS>
<BOS> Sighing in resignation, you hunt for your assigned cabin, only to find several people already inside: a woman in the uniform of the crew, a Journeyman mage, and a beautiful woman in crimson robes. <EOS>
<BOS> “Nothing to the likes of you. You don’t look like you could afford it anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> There is a lot of militia milling about when you get there, but fortunately other than a few suspicious glances, you don’t even get harassed. You board a carriage believing that you have no doubt made the right decision. <EOS>
<BOS> While you haven’t brought it up to her, you think Tanya’s lost sight of her “original goal” of simply taking down the Ebony Claw Syndicate. She may have even believed that’s what she was doing at first, but now? She’s just been enjoying the chaos. She’s enjoying making people kill and fight. Granted they probably were going to do that anyway, but she’s not exactly curtailing what’s currently going on right now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah. You didn’t know that? His buddy David used to tell stories about her and make jokes all the time back when he was still alive. She used to work as a miner and had a girlfriend who Tom always insisted was just her roommate even though they slept in the same bed. Still in denial about it, though he might actually be that clueless. Y’know, I don’t think he ever knew who his father was. Now that I think about it, I’m sort of wondering how Tom was even conceived in the first place considering from what I heard his mother was firmly into pussy.” <EOS>
<BOS> Trobart shakes his head at you and moves on while you head back to your room. Along the way, you bump into Virgil who you haven’t seen in a long time and were looking for, but now that Trobart’s given you the info… <EOS>
<BOS> “We’re not peddling sex slaves of any kind, Vera. That’s it.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, you were just about perfect…shit…so how have you been?” <EOS>
<BOS> You cross the verdant courtyard, admiring the shiny silver fur of the ferrets playing there, and head into the massive tower itself. The rich line one wall, and supplicants of all classes line the other curve. Yet another guard checks your ticket, and you are ushered towards the middle front of the line, behind about 6 others. It takes a half hour, but eventually you are next. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck off Warts, why the hell is this half breed even still allowed around here? He’s always claiming he isn’t really part of the League anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> "That would be fair to say." <EOS>
<BOS> "Aw come on Zal, he worked really hard on it! He even improved upon the original layout!" Vaughn exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s time. The sun has recently set, and a layer of clouds dampen the moon’s brightness. The conditions couldn’t be more perfect besides possibly a fog. Richard scurries off, bow in hand, to travel to the opposite side of the camp. You didn’t exactly know what the signal would be, but he said “you’ll know it when you see it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Any way you could alter his mind or something similar?” <EOS>
<BOS> “There’s a representative from the Syndicate here as you know. Now I have to pay him an amount of coin that I don’t particularly want to before he leaves in a few days.” <EOS>
<BOS> You see no reason to decline this request and spend more quality time with Annah for the rest of day (and night). <EOS>
<BOS> "In three months, there is to be a day of races and other competitions. The one among you whose horses perform best will become my chief stable master." <EOS>
<BOS> “Apologies, but shit is tough all over nowadays. Besides you need to relax, we’re not taking all of it. Just a little bit.” A deeper voice says. <EOS>
<BOS> You head upstairs and make your way to your room. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey boss, I got some hobs from da Spider Fangs dat wanna join the fights tonight.” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t want him. That’s not why I’m here. Now call off your people, I’ve killed your enemy as you can see.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You know, I’ve been thinking more about that and I’m starting to think that T’ra’ni is right and I shouldn’t be ashamed of who I am. I mean why should I? It’s no big deal.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You want to speak with the high priest? Why in Fel’s name would we let you do that? You might be ECS, but you aren’t even one of the faithful! I can tell! You better get out of here before you’re unable to do so!” <EOS>
<BOS> Once night falls, you return back to the training grounds and find Seth along with others. <EOS>
<BOS> And here it is, the shakedown. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I guess we can’t all be blessed with the charisma you have.” <EOS>
<BOS> Elder Flynn says this with such conviction that you don’t respond and are just wondering if you’re going to be able to get out of here alive. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah at this point gets closer to the guard as she spins this tale. <EOS>
<BOS> “HELP THERE’S A RAPIST IN MY ROOM! HELP! HELP!” Annah screams. <EOS>
<BOS> This isn’t without cost however. As time goes on, the Joachimites manage to drum up more support in the form of their non-combative followers. All those regular Joachim fearing Holgard citizens that weren’t directly involved are now becoming more of a problem as several start openly standing up to Nocturnal League members in the streets preaching about how the League is a blight on this godless city and divine justice will soon be upon you. This never goes well for them of course, but it’s not doing wonders for you either. <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, Marco managed to do it and he’s an idiot.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Who did this then? Where is my mother and the rest of the villagers? The ones left behind are all zombies!” you gush all at once. <EOS>
<BOS> Within the week you get the news from the paper about how the Crimson Talons were absolutely crushed by the Klyton militia. A big announcement is made of how the Talons are no longer a threat in the Klyton and have at last been brought down after decades of terrorizing the city. <EOS>
<BOS> About six blocks later, they start splitting off - some towards a row of square houses built one against another, so close you could skip on the rooftops as well as a road, and the others to a series of three story buildings and shops. As you come to the crossroads, you find a large wooden sign has been erected with a giant sketch of the city pinned to it. You take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with it, but even once you have the general sense of it, you worry getting lost will be easy, here. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well what do I owe the pleasure of this unexpected visit from the head of the infamous Crimson Talons this fine day?" Mr. Reynolds says. <EOS>
<BOS> Your crude remark is enough to finally set off Elder Flynn’s temper. <EOS>
<BOS> Whatever Vera has done to you, you’re not going to torture her anymore. What’s done is done and there is no need in drawing this out. <EOS>
<BOS> “I thought we’d have a little chat with our friend… Wren was it?” Seth says, twisting the man’s face up to meet his. The man, Wren, does his best to nod. A figure emerges from the dark, Richard, leading a woman bound at the hands by rope. <EOS>
<BOS> You know this isn’t going to help matters, but given what you’ve been through already… <EOS>
<BOS> "I would love to see you in action, perhaps I could learn from you." <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t think the ECS is going to let me join anytime soon considering I just shot three of them.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re just not sure if this is such a good idea given that the women you have sex with tend to die afterwards. <EOS>
<BOS> “It does?” <EOS>
<BOS> You have to admit part of you is curious what it would be like since you've never ever considered being a pirate. Might be an interesting change of pace. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I guess the Empire came and annexed your people too huh?” <EOS>
<BOS> You aren't sure how big this patch of land is though; for all you know it could be a small island or a large continent. One thing is for sure though, it's cold and you're a long damn way from home. <EOS>
<BOS> “Nah, I’ve decided a change of plans and I’m just going to head back to Galpatolis. I know how much you said you wanted to travel and see new places, so I figured I’d ask if you wanted to come.” <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually Keira stitches up some of your wounds and places some sort of healing salve on them. She then gives you some spare furs to wrap yourself up in while your clothing dries. She tells you that you can stay here for a few days so you can heal up. As much as you’re in a hurry to get to Arcanius, it probably would be best if you rested. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s very relevant, because apparently this asshole has been skimming money for himself for years.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> As you wait for things to get started, someone sits next to you, when you turn to see who it is, you can’t believe who it is. <EOS>
<BOS> “BURN.” Tanya utters and you jump back just in time to see all of the furniture barricade go up in flames along with unfortunate wizards that were climbing over it at the time. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because I love you! I did this all for you! I’m doing this ALL for you! I would never hurt you!” <EOS>
<BOS> "Are you sure?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright, let’s do this then.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Honestly, if anything Annah’s loud bitching is going to attract more attention to your position than a fire at this point. <EOS>
<BOS> “No. It’s not like that! I mean yeah she’s royalty, but not really. I mean… I dunno, I’ve always sort of admired how she took power from her father and brother I guess. She’s a very powerful independent woman and has remained that way. I guess that’s what I admire.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, well I can honestly say I’m glad you decided to join. Your skills are going to come in useful and as you can already tell I’m going to need all the help I can get. Guess since I’m the boss, I’ll take Edmond’s old room. You can have this one. It’s one of the better ones in this place so consider it part of your reward for rescuing the leader of Crimson Talons.” Tom chuckles. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, you glorified cut throat, just THINK for a moment! The Tanya you knew is GONE. She left you for the infernal realm a LONG time ago and probably forgotten about you. In fact you’re very lucky she has because I guarantee that she is NOT the same woman you knew. She has most likely become a being of pure evil, no matter what she might have told you before she left. Any concept of love would be gone by now along with any affection for you.” Flynn rants. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s what I thought. Now contrary to this dead fucker’s words, I’ve been risking my ass more than ANY of you since day fucking one! Who the hell was it that was leading the damn charge when we took out the Joachimites and Felians? As I remember it was me. And what the hell have I been doing while you lot were hiding like cowards, I’ve been trying to keep this organization together by defending our shit! So don’t give me this bullshit that I’ve been leading from the back. Maybe the real problem is you shitheads have all gotten lazy because you have no regular opposition. Scared of a real fight. Y’know what? Fuck all of you. I’m going back up there to try to salvage what this organization still has left. The rest of you can either help or get the fuck out of the way, but what you can’t do is stay here. Because when I come back, I find ANYONE still here, you’ll be joining these troublemakers on the floor.” <EOS>
<BOS> "No, simpleton, your tongue." the Wyrm Empress commands, and puts a drop on. The lady grimaces, but dutifully obeys. When she doesn't drop dead, the Empess nods, satisfied. <EOS>
<BOS> "Okay, it's deal, but I'll have to come back later with the money. I also have to do a little reconnaissance so I know where exactly to have Junior go find his targets. I'll be giving you a list of names and physical descriptions as well." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> The only good thing about tonight is you killed the top asshole of the cult that was trying to kill you. You imagine there are still others around, but you can’t worry about it right now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, dead. All of them. I’m the only one who survived. I can only hope my lost brothers and sisters are with Fel now.” <EOS>
<BOS> Yet…you can’t help it…there’s something about her that just… <EOS>
<BOS> But what was their mistress to do? Each of her stablemen had won an event. But as she brought the horses out to receive their various awards, a curious thing happened. The crowd would cheer loudly for certain horses, and some were receiving all the sugarcubes and flowers from the children! <EOS>
<BOS> “This Flynt you mentioned is a known Ebony Claw Syndicate lieutenant and you’re saying you aren’t affiliated with them? All right son, just stop talking right now and get…” the sergeant says. <EOS>
<BOS> “I see. Well this is slightly different bit of business than I thought you had in mind. I thought perhaps you wanted to try to renegotiate our payment terms or perhaps ask for assistance in expanding to Klyton. A complete surrender of one’s business to us without any force or influence at all is extremely rare. May I ask, why you’re doing it?” <EOS>
<BOS> “In my attempt to convince Tanya, things unfortunately turned…violent. I was lucky to get off a headshot before she landed a hit on me. Don’t worry, nobody else knows about me and I got rid of the bodies.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Seems like there is always some major shit going on in Holgard that affects the whole damn place and you’re starting to wonder if it isn’t just you that’s cursed, but the whole fucking city. <EOS>
<BOS> “People could just quit? I sort of though joining something like this was a for life type of thing.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Stop!” he shouts. “Lay down your arms and you will be given a merciful death.” <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t even argue anymore as you feel the glory that is Vera’s oral skills. Given how many times she’s offered this to you in the past, this has got to be a major fantasy for her or something. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s amazing what changes can happen in just a year and that’s not even counting the fact that Holgard is in complete anarchy right now, though it probably helps quite a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm? Who is that? Better not be you Timothy, I told you I wouldn’t have that endurance potion ready until tomorrow. The whores will just have to wait…” an old lady says as she comes out from another room. <EOS>
<BOS> The girl who you’re guessing is Layla doesn’t look that old. She looks to be in her late teens and is probably from some far off land given her darker complexion and some of her facial features. She’s also still dressed in clothing that doesn’t match her current slave status. (At least for most of them around here) <EOS>
<BOS> “Well my father used to go here and I…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe, so what’s all this about someone looking for me?” <EOS>
<BOS> You aim for the closest park - a patch of green of middling size with a few scrawny palm trees and old benches. It's full of people, which would normally be ideal, but it looks like you aren't the only one seeking a quick way to earn coin. Buskers and beggars are stationed near every corner and cranny of it. You count at least a dozen before you give up. There's no way you can tell a story here. <EOS>
<BOS> “What about the members at the gate?” Bolt asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m getting the impression, you don’t want to talk about a deal with the Syndicate after all.” Percy says, which causes Toz to immediately stand a little straighter and the rest of your people to put their hands to their weapons. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t see why not and I mean we probably could do a lot more damage with just the two of us no longer being restrained by Garrick’s caution. We can make a plan. The more I’m thinking about it, the more I really want to do this. I feel like giving myself this purpose would be a good way of directing my energy. Granted it’s not exactly the most virtuous way, but surely it’s still a positive thing taking down a criminal organization that engages in various violent and illegal activity, right?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Vaughn, this is your lucky day. You’re inheriting everything and it required absolutely no effort on your part other than being more competent than every other Crimson Talon here.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> This city is a violent crime ridden pit of corruption. <EOS>
<BOS> She doesn’t get far when you tackle her to the ground. After a bit of struggling you manage to subdue her, by getting on top of her and holding her wrists down. You’re breathing heavy and have a nasty look in your eyes. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm saying maybe it's time to get out." <EOS>
<BOS> Also a big positive is the fact that in times of disasters, crime usually goes up. You imagine that some of the Jicol Watch is now down quite a few people too, so you predict that the League’s forays into Jicol will still go relatively unscathed as long as you keep a low profile. <EOS>
<BOS> "This my dear sister, is the woman who turned me from a life of crime. This is my wife Zalmora." You exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> He goes on to tell you that their high priest is Elder Flynn and he tends to be a bit aloof and always involved in some magic experiment so you might not even get to speak to him directly as he prefers to let one of his subordinates take care of things. Shade also mentions if you’ve got anything magical laying around, that might help you get a meeting with any of them since they love collecting magic items. <EOS>
<BOS> You race for the cabin through the flying ash and jump down from the donkey, pounding on the door. <EOS>
<BOS> “Unarmed combat, of course. I won it last year.” <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t know this city very well and you’d most likely be caught within five minutes, you’d probably also be beaten for your troubles at best. You aren’t quite suicidal enough to try…or perhaps you’re just not brave enough. Whatever the case, you stay put and resign yourself to whatever fate the judge has for you. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Percy calls a waitress over and orders a drink. <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re exiting Sneaks room, a grubby dwarf walks up to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “This doesn’t have to be the worst day of your life.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Hmm, you seem very helpful towards a stranger. Makes me wonder if you don't have an angle." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “By Dolak’s barnacle encrusted balls, if you were any dumber…(Sigh) Just because someone is wearing a hooded cloak don’t make them a highly skilled assassin. Besides, assassins kill people not sit outside hallways like guard dogs.” Metzger remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Given what you know of him and the Black Hooks, they’re a gang of youths that engage in a lot of petty crime such as punching old ladies and taking their coin bags. You’re also aware that more than a few of them though are getting hooked on Purple Wish so that might play a part in negotiations. Though as far as you’re concerned, this isn’t going to be much of a negotiation, it’s going to be you telling these wannabes if they want to be continue along their path of delinquency, they’re going to have to start falling in line. <EOS>
<BOS> Sage is the closest of the muses. His hands are lifted in the air, his wise eyes fixed on something far off. Vrolik is smirking - there is even a bit of color left in his cheeks, and his staff is in mid-twirl. Bivedos looks to be hovering off the ground at first glance, legs crossed, but you see after a moment's inspection that he is balancing on a tail. Willow has her eyes covered, as if weeping - a common enough pose for her in life, so perhaps it is a fitting posture for her in death. Mizeria stands strong, daunting, a cry of pure rage on her face. Her arms, like Sage's, are lifted, but unlike his that seem to pull an invisible power to him, hers are palms up, fingers curled, as if pushing something away. You notice that each of them is somewhat mottled in appearance; some parts are grey, like plain stone, while other parts are colorful like wax and almost glow with life. Some of them seem more alive than others, and that life calls to your own. <EOS>
<BOS> “Who leads them then?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> "If you want to be bothered I suppose you could, but I'm not really worried about the Klyton militia tracking me down for it. I mean if they ever did find me, it would be for a whole bunch of other shit first." <EOS>
<BOS> You quickly explain how you came to learn about your unfortunate condition and everything else relating to it. When Vera asks about a cure, you explain that the cost is too high from what you know about the one time it was offered to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…I hear you there. I admit we’ve all sort of gotten lazy about that over the years. I remember when I first joined I was one of the best cat burglars here. As things slowly deteriorated, guess I just said fuck it. So what else you think needs changing around here?” Zalmora asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “You could come to Jicol, it isn’t like the League is disappearing. It’s just relocating.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You know the way huh? How do I know you aren’t going to lead me into an ambush?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure. They get so tame they hardly even bite. It’s a good thing people eat so many; otherwise we might get too many. They breed pretty fast.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Really should have thought about doing it before. I was just so concerned about keeping everyone together and happy, I neglected to remember that I’m supposed to be improving our position as leader, not just being content on survival. Anyway, I’m sure this will be something everyone can get on board with, well the majority of them anyway. And yes, since you came up with all this, you can still keep your activities to Klyton while you seek out potential new members. I know you won’t make a damn mess of things and generally keep your head down.” Tom remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well Gert, but you need to speak quickly NOW.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> You wait for a few hours and the line never seems to move which makes sense since there’s only one healer and his assistant working. By the time you start to get closer, the assistant decides to tell everyone that they’re closing for the day. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah? And where are they now?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well I’ve checked enough of the basement to know that most likely there isn’t going to be anything that precious up there that’s going to make me want to stay another moment in this fucking house. There’s some dark magic going on here and I’m not sticking around for it rub off on me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I sure hope so at this point.” You respond still trying to gather yourself from Rook’s punch. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 33 <EOS>
<BOS> The one time you want the Ebony Claw to be effective, they slack off. So much for protecting their own interests. <EOS>
<BOS> “But she’s much older than him.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wow, really? Well I wasn’t expecting that. Awfully nice of him.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Certainly an unconventional way of taking over a ship. Signaling for help legitimately, being invited aboard as an act of mercy and then when you were feeling slightly better, you just held them all at gunpoint. Still, not only did you bring back an entire new ship intact, you brought back most of the crew as slaves, as well as all the loot. Not sure what we’re going to do with crates of scrolls with Nichan writing all over them, but I’m sure someone is going to have an interest in this stuff. Always a market for something.” <EOS>
<BOS> He’s going to be the dangerous one, because as soon as you kill Rook, he’s going to be firing on you from somewhere. You’ll have do some sort of acrobatics when you take Rook by surprise. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re up for quite awhile, but hear nothing except the usual sounds of various insects, owls and other nocturnal animals. Eventually sleep catches up with you and you close your eyes. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe in a few minutes. Um, you uh…good?” You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> The whole point of being a rogue was so you didn’t HAVE to get a real job and have a boss in the first place! If you get wrapped up in an organization like the Ebony Claws, you’re also likely to be in it “for life” and that’s a bit too much commitment for you. <EOS>
<BOS> “So…what then? You miss your Talon buddies? I can’t help with that. They were a bunch of idiots and I was never in this to make friends. Unless you’re saying you’re missing your boyfriend. If that’s the case, well…as you’ve gathered I’m not exactly trusting on that front either however I’m not going to say no to a tumble I suppose.” <EOS>
<BOS> Time passes and eventually Percy and Toz arrive. Percy looks as jovial as he has since he got here, while Toz looks about as grim serious as he always has. You still aren’t sure what to do about him. Fel didn’t mention him, but you can’t imagine that you aren’t going to have to kill him as well. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, I was part of the Ebony Claw and you know how powerful they are. When they dissolved in Holgard I could hardly believe it. When I learned that you had a hand in that to some degree and you stepped in with building the Nocturnal League, I thought that maybe you were definitely a man worth following. I even thought relocating was a good idea than staying in Holgard.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re here now, you might as well finish it. Besides, it would be best if you saw to eliminating Sneaks because you sure as hell don’t want him escaping somehow to give you grief later. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hello. I’m Tanya and…” the girl says. <EOS>
<BOS> Heather motions you towards the door quietly and you nod once more at Flynn before exiting. Your walk to the temple entrance is silent as a few acolytes watch you leave, but say nothing. <EOS>
<BOS> “…and your mind sharper,” the company echoes. <EOS>
<BOS> “History has changed for the better,” you answer. “Any word of the Emperor? Well, I should say, the former Emperor.” <EOS>
<BOS> “He’s been gone longer than Yinen. Though I think in his case he’s deliberately staying away. Last thing he mentioned to me is that bad things are going to happen here soon and he doesn’t want to be around when they do. Can’t say as I blame him either. I’m still surprised this place hasn’t gotten hit yet by the Ebony Claw. What the hell is Garrick doing about them anyway? Because as far as I can tell, they’re not dropping in presence.” <EOS>
<BOS> "No, I'm for getting rid of them, but I just don't think we should be the ones to do the deed if we don't have to." <EOS>
<BOS> But will you find answers there, or just more questions? <EOS>
<BOS> “Wat? You crazy or sumthin? You don’t pick a god, youz gonna be in trouble when ya die! Even pickin’ some stupid god like Karn would be better than nuthin! You don’t believe in anything an’ who knows WHERE yer soul goes! Nah, better to pick somethin’ just in case.” <EOS>
<BOS> “But what I hate…(sob) most of all… is…that we can’t be together…” <EOS>
<BOS> At this point some of the other students have manages to blast part of the door open. Several begin trying to climb over the furniture still in the way. <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose it’s worth looking into, I’ve got a suggestion of where we should.” <EOS>
<BOS> “If you’re concerned that I’m plotting to escape, I’m not sure how I could without you knowing and I do not believe I’d make it very far. I fear that this is my life now and can only hope that you and your wife are merciful masters.” <EOS>
<BOS> Many nights you thought about your family and how you’d possibly never see them again. You even cried on more than one occasion. Maybe you left on bad terms, but probably in the back of you mind somewhere you thought that maybe you’d reconcile somehow with your mom and dad. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe itz our expansion inta Jicol? We’s startin’ ta get bigger, dat shit kinda draws tenshun. Probably shoulda stayed small.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well what?” you answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Been doing jobs without me?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, we’ll talk about this later when we’re not out in the open potentially…” <EOS>
<BOS> The only thing that’s starting to bother you a bit is that Warts has apparently restructured the “bandit parties” outside Holgard without your knowledge. While you replaced some of your less “outdoors” folks with hobs, Warts has been completely segregating the groups so that the hobs are all in one and all the humans are in another. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well we can try again later after... shit, I’m tired. I dunno if I’m in any condition to process a plan right now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “And why the fuck not?” <EOS>
<BOS> You understand her meaning. The other kids were brought to the monastery from birth. Your history was unknown to them, and more than a few children near your age were turned down. They don’t understand why you’re allowed to stay or why Brother Samuel has taken such an interest in you. Part of it could be jealousy, part of it could be the nature of kids. Perhaps a bit of both. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, we’ll get through this.” <EOS>
<BOS> Your hearts sinks when you hear this and then you instinctively start to go for your weapon. However the older man backs off and raises his hands. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I suppose if there is anything of value, it might be down there. Of course who knows what might be down there, so we should be careful. I wouldn’t be surprised if there were traps.” <EOS>
<BOS> “All secrets are eventually uncovered by Fel.” He says and then lets go of your shoulder. <EOS>
<BOS> “Madeline…what’s going on?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Our baby is going to be how I remember the good times with you and I’m going to be an attentive mother no matter what.” She whispers in your ear. <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose that makes sense. Okay then, apologies for my fussing as you put it..” <EOS>
<BOS> Dusk puts one finger to his lips and says “Shhhhh” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well look on da bright side boss, it looks like she got a cleaner death with a quick axe strike as opposed to wat dose cultist fuckers woulda did.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well of course you’re still going to think about her. From what I can tell, she had fucking demon powers that aided in fucking with your head. Not to mention it sounds like you had a genuine relationship with her. Those things mixed together are going to cause some lingering feelings. I mean shit, I remember this asshole boyfriend I had back when I was a teenager. He wasn’t even a demon and he knew how to say all the right shit to me and I was fool enough to fall for it most of the time. And despite the fact he’s no longer in my life, there’s still a part of me that remembers the few really good times with him.” <EOS>
<BOS> “…Well?” <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s without a doubt, the stupidest fucking shit you’ve ever said involving Tanya. I’ve known you since you joined the Guild and you’ve flirted with her shamelessly beyond a point where others have gotten shanked by her for their troubles. The ONLY other person I know who’s gotten this obsessed with Tanya and lived is Garrick, though Yag knows he’d NEVER fucking admit that.” Sneaks says. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm positive. My boyfriend said the militia are going to do an intensive sweep of this district in a week. The Klyton Council wants to prove they're tough on crime again. Apparently there have been complaints that things have been getting too lax." Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “What if he’s some highly skilled assassin? I mean he’s got a hooded cloak and all…” <EOS>
<BOS> You dodge out of the way, but your leg doesn’t completely clear the charge and you fall to the ground face first. <EOS>
<BOS> Gloom has also extended a hand to the Nocturnal League, stating that the temple would be more than willing to come to an understanding like it had with the Ebony Claw Syndicate and train your members in shadow magic. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, well I don’t see how this is any of your concern. Tanya, from what I can tell is a full grown woman that’s MORE than capable of taking care of herself and dealing with the likes of me. And as far as I know, you’re not her father either even if you see her as some sort of surrogate daughter.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well we’re in agreement there.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You catch a lot of them huh?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Couple days? You acted like you were in there for weeks!” <EOS>
<BOS> The day of the Grand Melee has finally arrived. The weeks since your talk with Kassi has been spent preparing for this day. The event takes place on a nearby mountainside. Halfway up the rocky slope, a section of the mountain jettisons out as if the top portion was cut cleanly off. The result is flat-topped overhang, which overlooks the surrounding hills. Many monks trek to the area for prolonged meditation, but today it was meant for combat. <EOS>
<BOS> "I doubt it. There was no love between her or them. Wendy distinctly said they were disappointments to her when she tried to get more money out of me. Besides, it's been a couple weeks since they discovered she was missing and they didn't seem all that concerned before." <EOS>
<BOS> “Miss?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Grateful?! I could have gotten us out of that situation a lot easier if you’d just gone along with the whore story!” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “To cut to the chase, I wish to speak to your Elder Flynn as I’m seeking your help in taking down the Joachimites. I believe it is in everyone’s best interest that they aren’t allowed to spread in this city. Plus, I figure your group of all people would finally want to put an end to this religious war.” <EOS>
<BOS> You walk past Randi and make a quick trip to the nearest apothecary. <EOS>
<BOS> “Can you break away? I need your help with something.” <EOS>
<BOS> Later when you inform Marco, (who was just starting to enjoy his time off) he is indeed not happy about hearing what his latest task is going to be, but you don’t need him to be happy about it, just compliant. Which of course he is. He does carouse extra harder though for the remainder of the time off you’ve given him though. <EOS>
<BOS> “You don’t mean that. Sure, they’re overindulging a little bit, but this is the greatest day of their lives. Let them celebrate, and not to worry, their penance will be a splitting headache in the morning.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, leave some room for actual valuable, you’re supposed to be carrying shit for me, remember?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, can we not talk about that right now? You don’t really want to know anyway.” Madeline responds. <EOS>
<BOS> "I had a job boss, but the business got shut down by the government and in this environment, it's hard to get work." He says following you. <EOS>
<BOS> Another month passes and things have settled down slightly. You constantly ask for news updates from the mainland, but nothing of major importance is reported. No rumors of the Syndicate preparing for an attack or anything. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera kisses you goodbye and heads off to the next group of cages while you head to her office. <EOS>
<BOS> Never being one to miss an opportunity, you quickly deprive Graham’s body of the jeweled rings on his fingers. You then also go through the pockets that you can get to and get a bag full of gold coins. <EOS>
<BOS> As Percy hobbles away, you briefly consider opening the small box he left, but don’t bother, instead throwing it away. You also briefly consider shooting Percy, but given the pathetic state he’s already in and potential problems it could bring, you decide against it. He’s just the messenger anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> "This a bunch of fucking bullshit." Camid exlaims. <EOS>
<BOS> Barro, the third, made an obstacle course for the horses to practice on, with high jumps and barrel turns, trusting that their skill would be apparent. <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh? Yeah.” She answers. <EOS>
<BOS> Through the doorway to the main hallway, you see Kassi engaged with several soldiers. Their armor is nowhere as neat as Seth’s, if you could call it armor. It's more like rags, with some areas of reinforced leather, than actual armor. The long hair and unkempt beards of the invading soldiers make them seem more animal than man. They fight with the same savagery that you’ve seen in your encounters with woodland creatures surrounding the monastery. <EOS>
<BOS> After only an hour of discussion you and Toz come to an acceptable deal. You don’t think Toz wanted to stay any longer than he needed to since he says he’ll be leaving right away. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you spend an entire day and night on a nearby rooftop watching the place, hoping that you’ll see him come out. He never does though. In your state of weariness, you barely react in time to hear someone approaching. <EOS>
<BOS> But soon, the bird grew melancholy. Not wishing his bird to die in anguish, the noble struck a deal with the nightingale. For one hour, every morning, the noble would allow the bird to fly free. But when the shadow of the sundial marked ten o’clock, the bird must return to the cage. And for half a year, the nightingale was happy once more. In exchange for an hour of freedom, he was content to spend the others in captivity to the noble. <EOS>
<BOS> A few days pass and Annah tries to see you, but they won’t let her in. Your parents won’t be denied however and of course your expensive advocate speaks to you as well to get all your information. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes. Our relationship hasn’t always been the most stable, but I know I’ve loved this man for quite sometime and I know with his self sacrificing actions of turning me away and suffering in silence for years, that he loves me as well.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because I’m a Crimson Talon and if you’re going to be whispering ideas into Tom’s head and I’m going to be affected by those changes, in the unlikely event he even listens of course. Besides, I might have a few ideas of my own.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes we can read.” You say with annoyance. “I’ll take the book too.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, but there’s also anticipating getting out of the way of trouble you can’t handle. Not saying that time is now, but it’s coming soon. And this nice comfortable set up you have might all come crashing down even if you’re careful. After all, with the Talons out of the way, attention is going to focus on the next biggest criminals in the city and I’d say you’d fit the bill.” <EOS>
<BOS> You open up the door and everyone is running around attempting to avoid the horde of Klyton militia piling through the front door. They aren't fucking around either because they're outright shooting or stabbing folks that are only barely resisting. Annie and Carl from what you see have already given up and are kneeling on the floor with their hands behind their heads. <EOS>
<BOS> You set things in motion and have some of your people go fetch the ECS reps. You aren’t exactly sure how this is going to play out, but you put on extra body armor and armed yourself with a couple extra blades and pistols and have Marco and everyone that’s going to be with you do likewise. <EOS>
<BOS> The air is heavy with the scent of fish and sweat, and the noise of cargo being offloaded. After the harsh trek through Ashen Veldt, you hope travel by ship on the Glass Sea will be smoother, and that the open ocean air with cleanse your nose of fish and perspiration. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fine, if you’re that concerned they’re in the next room, you go speak with them both and get a feel for her. And when I say feel, I don’t mean fucking her.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…still I should get going.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Excuse me.” A light tap on your shoulder alerts you to the presence of the woman who gave you the prompt. <EOS>
<BOS> “But…I really need…” <EOS>
<BOS> Your head reeling, you grit your teeth and head back to Ivani's side. Somehow, the forces pulling you in other directions are less when you are by her side. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?! You went with Camid’s rich bitch junkie whore? What the fuck are you thinking?!” Zalmora exclaims when she hears the news. <EOS>
<BOS> As horny as you are, there some things you don’t really want to risk doing. <EOS>
<BOS> Now you’ve completely lost it. <EOS>
<BOS> “What’s it do?” <EOS>
<BOS> It’ll be a brief break, but at least a pleasant one and given the life you’ve chosen it’s best you cherish those when you can. <EOS>
<BOS> While this is technically a “real” job, you can’t say you aren’t totally unopposed to performing it. Thirty gold is certainly better than what you’ve done in most weeks since your time here and it would give you a chance to go to Hessla for free. Maybe see if things are potentially more lucrative over there. <EOS>
<BOS> “Madeline…didn’t know you were coming…” you say struggling to breathe. <EOS>
<BOS> “Bout fucking time! You’re always late! And don’t think I don’t know how you get this!” Trobart says. <EOS>
<BOS> …and then a third AND fourth time. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well no, I’ve been trying to stay away and respect her wishes to leave her alone.” <EOS>
<BOS> "You get your health for one thing. Which I assume would be the most important. However, if it isn't, I would still point out that YOU will most likely still be making more of a profit than you are now with this rat palace. Also, the tavern will still be legally yours. We'll just be using it and basically paying for the place. Now, that should make you feel a little bit better about this non-negotiable deal shouldn't it?" <EOS>
<BOS> “There’s not that many of them. I say we sneak within their ranks after dark,” Seth says. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s all ya need man. He’s lissening, even if he doesn’t do anything.” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well I was going to see if I can find a diplomatic way of dealing with this, but if murdering the old lady is what it takes then so be it." <EOS>
<BOS> Of course you don’t have a pistol for nothing. <EOS>
<BOS> You place your hands around Vera’s throat and begin choking her. At first it’s only light, but as your thrusting gets quicker and harder, you begin tightening your grip. <EOS>
<BOS> "He has his lucid moments. Plus, um...we used to...meet up..." <EOS>
<BOS> You shake your head especially since this seems very familiar. <EOS>
<BOS> Everything else aside, Vera did have point about Wart’s plan which doesn’t seem very efficient. If anything engaging in more banditry on the roads to Holgard might cause the government to increase security so trade isn’t hampered. <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile, you waste no time in handing over the bottles to Garrick. <EOS>
<BOS> “Where exactly? You thinking about getting a League chapter in the Delantium Kingdom?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why? Because you love me madly obviously and you always will. You killed those women out of fear that you were betraying that love. However, you have a strange morality about you and that caused you to block it out. How you did it so easily, well that’s probably thanks to our bond and you gaining a very tiny bit of my mental powers. Except you didn’t even realize you were using it of course.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Mermaids or sirens. I dunno, whatever those underwater singing fish bitches are called. We were far to the southwest and coming back from a relatively successful haul. Everything was going well, and then someone said their heard singing. I instantly knew what the hell it was and told everyone to start shoving wax in their ears and don't look over the sides of the ship because those scaly sluts got a way of hypnotizing most men and making them do their bidding." <EOS>
<BOS> Richard pulls what appears to be a thick fern from the ground and tosses it to the side. The space opens into a series of cascading boulders underground. Large round stones create a natural staircase leading down. Richard goes in first, directing you where to step. He explains some of the stones are decoys, and stepping on the wrong one would send you to your death below. As you descend into the sanctuary, you cover the entrance with the fern, blocking out any sort of natural light. <EOS>
<BOS> Ardan just manages to stop himself from going over the side completely by grabbing the cliff edge. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I’m going to take big risk here, but I’m going to release you, but if you try anything I’m more than capable of defending myself. I’ve killed before!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you make it out of the palace. The guards don’t even react when they see you and just shrug as you continue to run from the palace and out the gates into the city. <EOS>
<BOS> “We did it. The Empire is no more. Tomorrow we’ll abolish the unified government and allow each territory to rule themselves. It’s taken decades, but we finally made it,” he says. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora takes her leave and you're free of her usual mother hen routine. You getting a little tired of that occurrence. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora nods her head. <EOS>
<BOS> “More safe than staying within the monastery walls,” he answers. “I’ll climb first. Once I get to the top, I’ll shake the rope. We better go one at a time just in case. Don’t worry, kid. If it holds my weight, it’ll hold yours too. Try to use your legs as much as possible to keep your grip from tiring. Alright, see you at the top.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hank, I’m really not. I’m serious. I mean I know it’s hard to tell sometime with elves, but they were definitely guys. All of them.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well from what I can tell, Fel’s plans mainly consist of him amusing himself. That was probably satisfied today from what I’ve heard of him. Anyway, can’t rage against the gods, just can only hope they don’t fuck you up too much. Still a pain in the ass though.” <EOS>
<BOS> You struggle to get out from under the dead body and going for your pistol, but the bandit has already taken advantage of your prone situation, by kicking you in the head. He then crotches down to punch you in the face several times before grabbing your pistol. You’re in a half conscious state and you can only hope Warts does something, but unlike you, he takes the opportunity to run rather than help. <EOS>
<BOS> “I…I’m sorry Tanya…” is all you can say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well you wouldn’t pay them all of it obviously and you could promise them some of the spoils. Either one of two things is going to happen. Either none of them survive and you won’t have to pay them or some of them survive which means they turned out to be a better investment after all and you still probably won’t have to pay much since I can’t imagine there will be that many survivors.” <EOS>
<BOS> You end up tumbling down the stone steps and twisting your neck in a manner that it’s not supposed to twist. Another bounce down the steps and you break it. By the time your reach the bottom, you’re already dead. <EOS>
<BOS> "You do?" <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t help but ask though… <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe in the short term, but you’re not thinking long term. The militia hasn’t been as much of a problem in the city for us because they’ve been focused mainly on catching Jake and the rest. That gives us a little more freedom to expand like you said. Hell, now that Jake has foolishly started to give his group their own name, they aren’t even directly connected to the Talons anymore.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, you could always gather the intelligence for us. Find out what caravans and wagons are leaving, which way they’re going, how well protected, all that stuff. Plus maybe you can start actively look for recruits.” <EOS>
<BOS> “We all make sacrifices in the pursuit of Dorna’s wisdom.” Heather says and looks a little embarrassed and resigned by this whole situation. <EOS>
<BOS> "Wait, you say she takes Yellow Devil? How the hell is she not a near drooling idiot yet? I don't need someone melting into a pile of goo in the middle of an important project." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, I don’t even know now. I know I was probably north east of here. There was a stone bridge and then I fell into the river and wound up here. I was travelling from Galpatolis and going to Arcanius.” <EOS>
<BOS> The library in Pefallis is very different. Despite the size of the building, there are only about 500 books inside, all old ones, and half of those are chained to the walls. Most of the space is filled by tables, and those tables by people reading. <EOS>
<BOS> You begin your tale… <EOS>
<BOS> “What? We’re not walking through the night? In fact won’t it be easier to slip by any potential hostiles in the dark?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey Tom.” You say entering his office. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point the cart stops completely and the pair of you are taken out and marched to the white building. When you enter the pair of you are still together for a little while, but eventually the sergeant tells some of his men to take you down a different corridor to Judge Randal. He and the rest take Mr. Scars down another and you part company. <EOS>
<BOS> When you wake up, it’s dark and you’re still in pain, along with being cold, the only good thing is you think you must have lost the orc since you doubt if you have reawakened at all <EOS>
<BOS> “It was.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, but you had the fortune of meeting me in an uncharacteristically generous mood.” <EOS>
<BOS> "FISH BITCHES! WAX! WAX! WAX! DON'T LOOK AT THE WATER!" He shouts nearly falling over in the process. <EOS>
<BOS> This seems to work somewhat, but you start to run into trouble when you see a green hand grab the side of the boat. <EOS>
<BOS> "What are you doing here? Are you in the city just for a visit? Where is Eliza? Are you still married to her?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Raven of Riverwood village;” Kragan intones, “given the current circumstance, it is quite a pleasure to see you. I had not hoped for any survivors and yet here you are.” <EOS>
<BOS> “HEY HE DOESN’T HAVE A GUN!” you hear one of the geniuses shout, but you and Annah don’t look back or stop until you get to the safety of the Welcome Mat and even then you go straight to your room. <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera, I’m telling you, you need to leave me right now, because I’m having a REALLY hard time here.” <EOS>
<BOS> You also see two figures battling it out on top of one of the few standing buildings left in the area. You see all manner of magic being thrown about and most of it hitting nearby parts of the city. You can’t quite make out the figures, but you’re guessing one of those might be Heather. <EOS>
<BOS> How you're even getting turned on by this in this scenario is either a testament to the oral skills of mermaids or you had some unknown twisted desires. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya may very well be a creature of evil that’s doing horrible things and no longer cares about you, but that doesn’t negate the memories that you have of her. You remember that one of her stronger traits is that she cherished her freedom. If you sentenced her to magical enslavement, you’d feel pretty damn shitty about yourself and you’re fairly certain you’d just replace your sense of loss with a bigger sense of guilt. Hell, it probably would be better just to kill her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Relax. Relax, nobody is stabbing anyone here. My son is a little excitable at times.” Mr. Reynolds says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Travel slowly. We don’t know what awaits us,” you say to the company. <EOS>
<BOS> “Lucy? You didn’t hear? She fell off the docks and drowned two days ago. Tragic.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Stranger! You’re not one of them! Not one those red robed freaks! (sob) Please! Help me! I can’t die here, not like this! I watched my…(choke) just please…help. Who knows when they’ll be back!” a nearly naked young girl in a cage begs. She reaches out to you desperately hoping that you’ll rescue her. <EOS>
<BOS> “I understand, sir and I thank you for your fair judgment.” You reply and nod. <EOS>
<BOS> Disbrook is a moderate sized town, ideally situated in that balmy area between the hot tropics and temperate climes. A small deciduous forest borders the fertile plains to the west, and inviting beaches edge the eastern part of the town. If you weren't on a mission, it would be pleasant to stay here a while. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, if I didn’t trust you, I wouldn’t have put you in charge of our chapter at Jicol, which obviously has been thriving under your management. You’ve always been an asset to the Nocturnal League…and hell you’re probably one of the few people I consider a friend.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I really wish you wouldn’t set a negative tone to this already difficult situation. I’ve been going back and forth about this multiple times, making myself sick over it actually.” <EOS>
<BOS> The day of the attack within the first hour you can hear cannons going off even from your position further in the jungle. With any luck Marco’s crew will manage to make it to the Jicol harbor without getting sunk in the crossfire. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because she’s an underhanded manipulator.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why couldn’t she have just broke up with Camid?” Vaughn asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Klint, put that knife back and just walk away now.” You say stepping back. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera might have a point, though part of you finds this pretty personal enough that you’d rather take care of this directly. <EOS>
<BOS> But all things end, and some things begin. You have the ferry ride on the morrow, then on to the Grove of Muses - so close now! Ivani has waited long enough. <EOS>
<BOS> 'Do not trouble the bees on my account,' she said, 'I will eat honey with you here after labor, or not at all.' <EOS>
<BOS> You look around and then hear it again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Together.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Kol, I think that’s been enough studying for today, you can go play. Don’t forget to put away your spell book though.” <EOS>
<BOS> While this wasn’t enough to kill him, the old traps that were at the bottom of said stairs well and you see a swinging spike impaling him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe, but I’m telling YOU to do it. I’m not risking having the locals run off with valuable equipment and you’re getting paid to protect EVERYTHING, so do your job and look out for the stuff!” Elana remarks and doesn’t even give you a chance to retort before she’s entered the inn. <EOS>
<BOS> “Heh. You guess not? Not sure are we? Well let me rephrase…are you a wanted criminal within the Delantium Kingdom?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hi. I guess you figured it out already.” She says. <EOS>
<BOS> “So you’re not interested in partnering up?” Zalmora asks. <EOS>
<BOS> In the next few days Shade finally manages to get around to speaking with you again. He tells you he’s been placing what little remains of his manpower in gathering information and has determined exactly where the Inquisitor is currently staying which apparently is a humble house where a normal Joachim fearing couple lives. He says nothing is special about this couple and has no idea why the Inquisitor is staying there, but that’s where he’s been. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yep, they showed me your letter when I was visiting not too long ago. Mom kept it.” <EOS>
<BOS> Vera can see you’re having some problems with this and tries to calm you. <EOS>
<BOS> However the most alarming part is Fel asking your son if he would like to go be with Felians as he could see to it that they treat him very well. He even mentions possibly having agents that would come get him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Think? You should have been doing that before! This is a fucking disaster! Y’know I actually thought you were someone worth following. I even had a little crush on you even though you kept turning me down, but shit, I can see now that you’re a damn jinx at best and a complete fucking idiot at worst and I’m not hanging around you any longer! Have a nice fucking life!” Vera snaps. <EOS>
<BOS> “Somebody was lookin’ fer ya.” <EOS>
<BOS> He's having a hard time getting up, and you see yet another charmed crewman walking over to finish him off. <EOS>
<BOS> It's too late to go back out into the storm and try your luck at the cabin, however. You lie on the cloak and curl the edge around yourself, hoping the night will come soon and be over just as quickly. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you trying to tell me something?” <EOS>
<BOS> “If I step out of this room I’m gonna end up fucking every person out there! Granted I’m usually up for a good time, but I still like them ONE at a time. There is some seriously decadent shit going on out there and I was THIS close to joining in on it. If I knew they were going to put something in the drinks here, I never would have agreed to come to this damn thing!” the masked woman says. <EOS>
<BOS> attempting to do it alone. <EOS>
<BOS> "Nah, just the sister. The brother was elsewhere. Pretty sure she was the one to deal with anyway though since she's the main one running that place. I satisfied her." <EOS>
<BOS> “Probably just another raccoon. I don’t know why we gotta patrol over here anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Durose!" Spryce spits. "Not helping. All of you, mind your own business on this. You passengers will get your duties from Captain Brost in the morning. And you sailors better mind your tongues." <EOS>
<BOS> Soon you and Heather are in position and it’s almost like she’s read your mind about the awkwardness of an audience since she whispers in your ear… <EOS>
<BOS> While the EC might be terrible shots, you certainly aren’t, you shoot three of them before they even manage to close in. Tanya on the other hand is perfectly content on taking on five of the assassins in close combat. <EOS>
<BOS> “The cult leader that seduced his way into high society? Interesting.” <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya holds your hand, which is very warm to the touch. When you look at her face again, you can still sort of see the old Tanya there. You still feel very close to her, though you’re a little worried about what might come next. <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno. I mean I suppose I see why I should, just don’t really feel up to it.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> Searching your memory, you remember in one of your mother’s stories about the inn she mentioned a Mr. Reynolds before. You never knew much detail though since you never really paid much attention. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya once again makes an unearthly scream as she’s hit by the blast. It’s enough to shake the room a bit and hurt your ears. Gwen looks exhausted, but unfortunately despite her wounds, Tanya is just getting started <EOS>
<BOS> Niro went to join them. Though no words were spoken, the commander nodded to them all. The humans would no longer aid the mages in their war. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re close to discovering the location of the shaman. The first real lead in months checked. What would originally be considered tribal superstition, fits Captain Wren’s description of the shaman. By chance, one of the Imperial transports you set upon were carrying prisoners, tribal members from the Yssar Plain. Their stories tell of a crumbling castle, haunted by an evil spirit. One of their tribe supposedly saw the dark spirit, cloaked in black, commanding the elements, before sprinting back to the tribe, but not before abandoning the buck he had hunted. The tribe ridiculed the man, stripping him of his honor for running in fear. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually as you get close to the destination you get out since Annah’s old home is off campus, not actually on it. When you finally get there, it’s indeed a nice home, but not overly fancy. You’ve probably passed it a few times not really giving it a second look. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, you’re going back and you expect me to just follow?” <EOS>
<BOS> “The absurdity of this horrible situation.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> Fortunately, the merchant doesn’t press whatever unnatural lust he has for you and proceeds to just speak about himself. He mentions his name Graham Oren famous wine merchant (Or at least he thinks he’s famous) and that he’s coming from the Delantium Kingdom to do a bit of business in Holgard. You’re a little disappointed since you were hoping to rip the caravan off in some way, but knowing he’s just hauling wine casks makes stealing those large wooden things a little difficult to do. <EOS>
<BOS> The discipline instilled in me at a young age was the main force behind my success. Others, perhaps, were more naturally talented than I. Not to say I wasn’t gifted; I definitely felt suited for this life, but my unwavering devotion to the practice set me apart from others. There were times in my early life I wished for a different fate. <EOS>
<BOS> “Warts, you’ll fucking help me, because I’ve saved your damn life on more than one occasion.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So…you’re not going to kill me?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Appropriate name.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sheesh, this isn’t sex. I figured this would be a simple enough task, even for you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well yes I could and I have, but they got their shit a lot more secure. Probably better than some jewelry stores. I start making that place a regular target and the price is going to go up.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So did they cause you a lot damage as well?” <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t really in any condition to run and there are enough of them that you don’t think you could fight them all. You don’t even have the advantage of your pistol any longer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright I’m going to explain a few things before hand. First off I suggest you fuck Vera from behind, because I’m not sure exactly how pissed your ex is going to be when she’s transported from her dimension and you’re going to want to be getting out of their as soon as you can. What you don’t want is Vera to start grabbing you tightly and preventing you to leave as she dies horribly from the inside out desperately holding on to the only thing she loves and then suddenly you’re covered in blood and gore and face to face with your pissed off demon ex instead. In fact I highly recommend you get out of there when Vera starts screaming and convulsing and not in the good way.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I know, which is why it’s weird that I didn’t even see him leave. Unless he left in the middle of the night, but none of the staff saw him leave either.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s good to see you too. Hey don’t squeeze too tight, I got my mandolin on my back and it’s pretty unique.” Your sister says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ay, youz still with me?” Warts asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe I’m just setting my sights higher. If I’m joining your Guild, I’m going to have to be better than I am. That means taking more risks even when there is potential danger.” <EOS>
<BOS> Halford nods and complies with Vera’s orders and as he’s leaving he also nods in respect to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, this is too fucking far! You’re gonna…” <EOS>
<BOS> You take off the blood stained and rank red robe and collapse on your bed. You’ve spent a lot of the night naked tonight, and not in a good way. <EOS>
<BOS> Hurry you fool before I regret saving you!” Tanya shouts and runs towards another rope that hangs from an opening she’s made in the glass dome on the roof <EOS>
<BOS> You spend a couple more days planning and preparing. Despite his magic going to be rendered impotent, Shade still wants to attack at night since he feels his people are still going to hold advantage over the Joachimites during that time. Since you don’t have any real preference, you agree. <EOS>
<BOS> “She never told anyone that. She would have left too, but then her mother showed up and after her brief meeting, she stayed with the Guild. Not because she had great attachment to it, but because she feared what she might do without it keeping her somewhat grounded. The Guild became a sort of sanctuary against her infernal nature. Sure, thievery isn’t exactly the most noble of professions, but it’s a far cry from what infernals like to engage in.” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> Rook has been trying to keep things together, but he’s been obviously losing control. The ECS leadership in the Delantium Kingdom has refused to help with reinforcements any more. They’ve told him that he needs to work with what he has and if he fails, it’s not going to be good for him. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually, however, he made it. The Tree of Speaking was vast and tall, a world in itself. The slug headed for the nearest root and slowly crawled up it, pleased to find ample lichen there, and small mushrooms. For a week he traveled the roots, slowly, eating his fill, until he came to a set that seemed to line up with the lines on the map. This gave him renewed hope - he was on the right track! Even without the rest of the pieces, the treasure was almost certain to be somewhere nearby. Three days later, he came across a patch of strange (but tasty) mushrooms that grew in an odd rectangular pattern. Perhaps something was underneath? <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, I’m originally from a small village far to the south. It’s so small, nobody really knows it exists.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, honestly, it was probably more stubbornness and pragmatism on my part rather than patriotism.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well somewhat, but this seems like extra complexity." <EOS>
<BOS> You give Henry the instructions and he listens without saying a word still giving you that icy stare the entire time. While a little unnerving, you can’t actually say you’re getting pants shitting intimidated. Henry could very well be the badass killer his dad claims, but right now he seems like he’s trying too damn hard. <EOS>
<BOS> You never really thought about it before, but shit, your dad worked fucking hard to achieve his goals. Makes you almost feel guilty about the fact that you pursued a life of crime, but at least you’ve got a little of his “work ethic” right? <EOS>
<BOS> You might be running on borrowed time, but you might as well enjoy it, because not many are in your privileged position in the infernal realm. <EOS>
<BOS> "Is it that bad?" you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Hah! Yeah, what the hell was that all about?" <EOS>
<BOS> Year 32 <EOS>
<BOS> “I have some money.” <EOS>
<BOS> “There you are! Y’know, you could have warned me about leaving town, instead of making me trudge through the fucking woods looking for you!” Annah snaps. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 17 <EOS>
<BOS> You look and see a woman dressed in fur clothing with a bow and she’s currently getting another arrow ready now that the orc’s attention is directed towards her and didn’t go down from the first shot. <EOS>
<BOS> The next morning she did not go to the hanging gardens, nor did she go to tend the bees. She was not found in her royal chambers, nor among the mazes or the pools. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that’s great and all, but how’s that fuck up the Ebony Claw?” <EOS>
<BOS> The Ebony Claw Syndicate chapter here never regrouped. None of the members who survived (And were mostly the lower ranks anyway), ever tried to reform and seemed to just go their own way. The ECS leadership back in the Delantium Kingdom never came back to “reclaim” their chapter either. You assume that they wrote this place off as a loss and moved on. <EOS>
<BOS> “Or what? You’ll leave? What if I don’t let you?” Graham remarks and then reveals a decorative and strange looking pistol with multiple barrels. Firearms aren’t common and you’ve only ever seen your grandfather’s old non-working troll gun hanging up in your house, but it’s obvious that this fat bastard is rich enough to have some sort of custom made one. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah, she took off. Just wasn’t working out y’know? She bitched a lot.” <EOS>
<BOS> You are quickly taken away and soon marched back outside, but this time to a large enclosed wagon with several horses at the front. You’re shoved inside and shackled to a few other prisoners. All of them are sizing you up and you do your best not to show any fear as the wagon door is closed and you’re on your way to Dreadcage. <EOS>
<BOS> “Telling the Governor of Hessla? You think that’s a wise thing to be threatening me with Flint given the circumstances?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well you said it yourself. They worship a dark god and are probably trying to summon infernal beings if they haven’t done so already. I believe Garrick thinks that having me by his side if he ever got to meet with Reginald, would help since y’know…being half infernal and all.” <EOS>
<BOS> “We should not decide hastily. One wrong plan could ruin us all.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Pretty sure some of these folks are under the lower class.” Zalmora replies. <EOS>
<BOS> “I think he does too,” you answer. <EOS>
<BOS> Feeling uneasy, you stand up and head towards the exit of this room only to be stopped by a living statue. <EOS>
<BOS> Small palmstones sit in the entrance to the passage. You wonder what they are for, and try a few out. The orange glow with light, like a torch. The blue morphs into a bubble of water in your hand, ready for a refreshing drink. The purple causes you to float! A power courses through you, as if piggybacking on your blood. Your feet leave the floor. "This is strange," you murmur to yourself, attempting to take a step forward. Instead of walking, you glide on air, each 'step' you take crossing the normal distance of dozens. You can even lean to shift directions as the passage winds through the ground. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well…it’s a bit disheartening…however I wasn’t even here about that.” <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sigh) So there’s no way you can help me?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, you’re right about that as well. I wasn’t a member when they still had the fighting pits, but I do remember seeing a few when my dad bet on them. Even as a little girl I knew I liked seeing two big guys get all sweaty and bloody, beating the shit out of each other. I know there are the Klyton gladiators, but they wear so much damn armor that they barely get hurt and it’s very rare to see a fatality. Pretty sure it’s all fixed anyway. The Klyton Council probably makes a shitload of money off that racket. Too bad we aren’t politicians.” Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Did you really think your imitations would stand up against the real thing?” the Unbroken speaks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I wish it was that simple. Unfortunately it isn’t. Though speaking of clear heads, I’m a little concerned with yours.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Nah, I mean like REAL dark forces. There’s just rumors about religion being involved, it’s very weird.” <EOS>
<BOS> "You may watch," the lion allows, "but be discreet." <EOS>
<BOS> "How - " <EOS>
<BOS> “Why? Are YOU a wanted criminal son?” <EOS>
<BOS> “All the more reason to do this now. One of us could die when we start seriously pursuing this path. Now I know maybe this isn’t going to be a big deal to you, but I think I’d like to actually experience sex in the flesh to see what all the fuss is about.” <EOS>
<BOS> While Warts plays wine expert, you take a look around the room and find that there are stairs leading up and a solid metal door to your left, which is locked. <EOS>
<BOS> As you collapse on the floor, wheezing and coughing up blood, Dusk’s whispering voice can be heard. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hasn’t failed yet surprisingly. Guess people just don’t know there ain’t no such creature.” Warts replies. <EOS>
<BOS> With a muted ring still going on in your head, you don’t hear the sound of a run away horse galloping your way. You’re trampled by the beast and feel the full weight of its hooves stepping on you and crushing some of your ribs in the process. <EOS>
<BOS> “If you had it in you to blow that sleezy fucker on a regular basis, along with continuing to work a thankless job just for a roof over your head, pretty sure murder shouldn’t be an issue. Besides, just look at the guy. You’d be doing him a favor at this point.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I should have done this years ago. I’ve seen small appearances of you rearing your ugly head, but I always thought he was strong enough to resist. The fault lies with me for not ending his life, and the line of the Unbroken, sooner,” Seth says in another assault. <EOS>
<BOS> Marco starts to say something, but you stop him. <EOS>
<BOS> “You seem to have given this some thought, and while I do often appreciate your input on things, the one problem I have in this case is you’re getting all of this information second hand from a pirate. Now I know you said your vertical smile caused the guy to go all stupid over you, so you’re certain he’s on the up and up. However, HIS information might also be mixed with rumors, half-truths and outright lies that he’s overheard. I mean if you were fucking Peter Varsakken himself and getting this information from him, I might believe the situation is as hopeless as you’re saying.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera makes one last outburst. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately you aren’t having much success for whatever reason. Normally something like this would crush your ego, but since you doing this more to alleviate your financial costs rather than getting laid, you’re just more annoyed than anything else. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh we can do that right now, we can just go to a church dedicated to Joachim the Pure. They usually always have someone on duty to do a quick marriage. Though I suppose if you have another preferred faith, we could go there instead, but I've never known you to be particularly religious." Zal says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well be that as it may, the new rent price remains. Hey, you should be lucky; I’m letting you stay here. I don’t generally have people making their homes here. Clientele tends to be travelling merchants and such staying for awhile, which I know damn well you’re stealing from. Another risk I’m taking.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Pfft, Vera always went on about how great you were with a pistol. She always bragged about you. The way I see it, if you were so great then why the hell did she betray you?” <EOS>
<BOS> You shake your head and reach into your pocket. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well that's nice that you're so open minded with your choice of sex partners, but is this dwarf an actual engineer? Contrary to popular belief, I don't think all of them dig big holes in mountains for a living." <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, got one of those half masks. Don’t really feel like struggling to breath with a full mask on that covers my mouth and nostrils. Still covers most of my face so I figure I’m good.” You say and put it on. <EOS>
<BOS> "That is enlivening!" the priestess across from you purrs after she drinks. "Far more power than usual." <EOS>
<BOS> “I got you Vera.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I was doing just fine with that! So why the fuck are you here anyway? You trying to get back with me? Because if you are, that ship has sailed a long time ago the moment you threw me out! Now stop stalking me and get out before I call security!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, so you’re saying if it WAS up to you, you’d let me in?” <EOS>
<BOS> You walk over to the halfbreed and kick him in the foot, which causes him to stir, so he’s not completely out of it. <EOS>
<BOS> Several minutes pass and you eventually can’t hold your breath any longer giving into a watery death. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, thanks.” <EOS>
<BOS> "We get the law to work for us for a change. Look, we all know Camid isn't going to be inventive enough to pick a new location to do business. He's probably going to go right back to that old location in the sewers. All I have to do is tell Gregory about the large Crimson Talon hideout there and boom. The militia takes care of our problem. Plus you know Camid, he'll probably go down fighting." <EOS>
<BOS> With no more feelings left for you, Tanya appropriately pulls your heart from you chest and eats it before your eyes. <EOS>
<BOS> “Did what?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah? For what purpose?” <EOS>
<BOS> “How should I know? All I do know is I had to load this carriage up myself. I thought YOU would be helping! Anyway, we have to get going, hurry up!” <EOS>
<BOS> “He’s not my captain. I came here on behalf of the Nocturnal League organization in Holgard.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “There would be no return without me. You owe me everything! I’ll have you slowly bled out, like a slaughtered animal, and take your power for myself,” the Emperor shouts back. <EOS>
<BOS> You try to go to the last known places where your people had camps, but you have to spend most of your time avoiding the Holgard Watch who are patrolling the nearby area a lot more. <EOS>
<BOS> “But you proved them wrong didn’t you?” <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re about to go over some reports, you hear a knock on your door. At first you think its Warts who forgot something, but when you open the door you see someone else entirely and it’s a big surprise. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well I imagine the bum fighting will still be held down here, but that tavern is big enough to have gambling games and whores set up. We're really going to have to fix that place up first though, because as it stands now, the place isn't much better than the sewers." <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes. Vera and I have finally realized after all these years that we love each other and thanks to that love, the necessary last element is in place for you to perform this ritual so that you may lift the curse.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “However after asking around at that backwards little town you grew up in, it seemed that you left not on the best of terms anyway. Apparently you were a complete disappointment to your parents. Hell, from what I heard, not a single person spoke well of you, except for some trashy barmaid that claimed to be your girlfriend at one time.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Bah, you let that dumb poet stay here for fucking free and as far as I can tell all she does is drive away your customers with her horrible poetry that she does on stage.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s about the Thieves Guild.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Far be it from me to get involved in your wizard standards, but the head of the school and her students did protect this city not too long ago.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Well, I suppose I can't convince you if your mind is already made up. Still, if for some reason you do change your mind, just head to a ship called the Steadfast. It's not the biggest ship in the harbor, but like it's name, it always gets to where it has to go and back." <EOS>
<BOS> “Seriously, you ALL feel this way? You fuckers are the most short sighted assholes ever if you’ve decided that right now would be the best time to pull a double cross and MORE fool you that you didn’t kill me right away.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re probably going to hit some of your own people, but oh well. <EOS>
<BOS> You see her roll her eyes and she releases you and sits back down. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah right. You barely even know me.” <EOS>
<BOS> At least you hope she does because it’s going to be a punishment if musicianship skips this generation. You also hope her poor skills on the flute don’t also match other skills involving blowing. <EOS>
<BOS> “Perhaps, but that’s still not happening.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Is this the room?” one of them says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hello Tanya.” You reply, not quite sure of how to react. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck this Marco, we’re going back. This has been a fool’s errand and we’re done with it.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Head slaver, interesting choice of words considering this situation. And now you don’t just want me to go with your idea, you want to be in charge of it. That’s pretty presumptuous of you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What? No, we’re not trying to shake you down. This isn’t Holgard son. I just wanted to know so I can tell you which inn you should probably check in at. Seeing as you said you don’t have much, I’d recommend the Welcome Mat, which isn’t that far from the main gate, you really can’t miss it.. The place is cheap and pretty safe. If you still can’t afford their low prices, they’ll probably have some tasks you can do to earn a place on their flop room floor at least.” <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s odd. Wouldn’t he have sent both of them?” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course. What is it?” Heather asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “But dad I don’t want to go away! I want to stay here with you and mom! Honest!” <EOS>
<BOS> You wake up with a really bad headache. In fact most of your body aches, but you don’t feel very weak and manage to sit up. Sunlight is coming through the window, so it must be daytime and your eyes are certainly feeling it. <EOS>
<BOS> The lock isn’t that difficult to pick and you soon get it open causing the girl to not even wait around, she just runs past you, out the torture room and beyond. You suppose you can understand her not wanting to stick around, but a thank you would have been nice. <EOS>
<BOS> "So what are you suggesting?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “How about me what?” <EOS>
<BOS> This little smug asshole’s tone is enough to cause you to nearly go at him, but Rook and Bolt both react in a manner that suggest that you shouldn’t even attempt it. <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sigh) I figured you’d say that. Well I don’t suppose there is much more I can convince you then since you seem to be immune to my other charms. Um… sorry about touching your hand like that, I sometimes forget our boundaries. I just…worry sometimes.” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I do like to be direct.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Annah! Are you fucking kidding me?!” <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you make your way back to headquarters and of course Zal is there. You already know what’s coming. <EOS>
<BOS> “But I’m not trying to fool you, it’s merely a gift to…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe, but I’ve noticed a severe increase in hobs in this organization since I came back to Holgard. Just don’t want this place turning into the Roach Leg Tribe.” <EOS>
<BOS> In any case at least this gives you a bit of magic leverage if trouble comes your way in whatever form. <EOS>
<BOS> “That sounded really convincing there son. Come on, if you got any you could spare some. You always got the luxury of grabbing yourself a drink at the first tavern in Klyton…assuming you’re even old enough...I can’t quite see you, but you sound fairly young.” The figure in the cage says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Hope they also have an award for getting wounded in the line of duty." You remark and pull a dagger stabbing him in the foot. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm gonna have to go over to his home or something because he can't just disappear like this. We're trying to run a business here." <EOS>
<BOS> The ones you insist on keeping around to train are fewer in number and you’re also the only one bothering to train them properly. You never thought you’d be in that sort of position. Occasionally Zal and Vaughn help out, but it’s mostly fallen on you. <EOS>
<BOS> “I believe they have their hands quite full still with Nichan, though I hear you’re starting to have more trouble with Hessla nowadays. I imagine you would be major competition for their once near monopoly on business for this part of the world.” <EOS>
<BOS> With the wave of Peter’s men dead, Heather takes a quick breather and it’s at that moment she finally notices you. She nods. You nod. <EOS>
<BOS> And you do love Zalmora. You both don't think you were certain of your feelings until that day when you both left "the life" permanently. <EOS>
<BOS> You find that despite being dressed in your lower class clothing, nobody is really giving you a second glance. It might be due to your youth though; you probably just look like a struggling student. Wasn’t like your dad was exactly rich when he attended this place either. <EOS>
<BOS> “Both gone, while I outlasted both organizations.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hold on.” You say and go answer the door. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, whatever happen ta Sneaks? He didn’t die did he?” Warts asks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh," you aren't sure what to say. Perhaps you should have gotten an itinerary from him before agreeing to sail with the Current Asset. "If that is the case, perhaps I had best get off at Castille. The city of Pefallis would be closer to my destination, anyway." <EOS>
<BOS> “Boss, I don’t see why we should risk our lives when we can just wait shit out down here.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Please," the priest laughs, seeing your consternation. "Be our guest. We only charge the wealthy tour groups that come through, now and then. When someone takes the trouble to come through the mountains, as you did, it's our treat. 'Visitors are the spice of life,' they say." <EOS>
<BOS> “What the fuck would you know about it?” <EOS>
<BOS> She struggles, gritting her teeth. She tries to strike, but in your dominant position her attack is ineffective. Eventually, her struggling begins to fade. <EOS>
<BOS> The Unbroken returns you back to the capital city. You arrive to find your army is full control of the city. The keep, without leadership of the Emperor, fell to your invading force. Countless fires burn throughout the city as your men have taken the initiative to burn every Imperial banner and coat of arms in sight. The Unbroken walks through the courtyard of the keep, stepping over the bodies of fallen Imperial soldiers. Your men stop what they’re doing, and salute you as you walk past. You find your commanders gathered underneath the high arches of the main hall. <EOS>
<BOS> “I also can’t ignore how you look at her and more importantly how she looks at you.” Garrick says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait! Stop! If you kill me, the Ebony Claw Syndicate will continue to hound you! Let me live and I can…” he says before you interrupt. <EOS>
<BOS> Since the mayor is in no mood to be talkative, you start things off by mentioning that it was a major mistake closing off his city in the way he did. You understand the reasoning, but by that time it just caused more enemies that might not have otherwise been. Like the pirates for one example. <EOS>
<BOS> Gloom examines the orb in his hand after his statement before continuing. <EOS>
<BOS> “We’re getting our new locations! By the fucking gods, what the hell is your problem today?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m aware, but that doesn’t mean they still didn’t do it. Besides all that, the leader has experience with underground dwellings that are half submerged in water.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No! That’s not what I’m saying! I’m saying, the girl that died in the fire? I SAW myself light the place up! The other that died of an overdose of Yellow Devil? I fucking injected her with it! And now I’ve been seeing myself stab you to death! This is worse that I thought! Before I thought maybe it was just demonic forces doing their work independently, but now it’s ME directly! I mean I’m not sure what’s worse, the fact that maybe there’s a curse on me causing me to kill these women OR something is fucked up in my head and it’s just been me the whole time! Either way, you’re not safe around me!” <EOS>
<BOS> “What you say is partly true I suppose. I very much would not like to be a slave, but I fear I have little choice in the matter. I was raised…not sheltered, but very much protected. I don’t have many skills that would be of practical use. I suppose its of some blessing that the pirate captain who spared me saw me as fetching a good price rather than to be something passed around by his crew.” <EOS>
<BOS> You turn down an alleyway to avoid a Holgard Watch patrol rounding up dissidents, and that’s when you bump right into Tanya. While you are caught off guard a bit, there’s a small part of you that was sort of hoping you’d see her. <EOS>
<BOS> You scream in agony and roll off the desk clutching you face. Despite the pain and the screaming, you manage to pull the quill out of your destroyed eyeball, which makes a sickening squishy sound. Blood leaks out on your face. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh shit! Vaughn! Help me barricade the door! We gotta get the fuck outta here!" You shout and slam the door shut. <EOS>
<BOS> "Hey, I wasn't the one who initiated consummating the marriage multiple times. I really don't WANT to do this to you at all, but this is the ONLY way you're going to listen!" Zalmora exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> “Great! Just remember I post notices all around campus. Just keep an eye out and you can usually find me in my office or in the lab, but um…actually just meet me in the office. The lab is a bit off limits to anyone who isn’t facility right now. I feel like I’m forgetting something…oh wait! Where is Elana?” <EOS>
<BOS> Interesting culture here. Almost reminds you of the set up you unofficially had back in your home town where they barely tolerated your thievery as long as you kept it to outsiders. <EOS>
<BOS> A couple days later a big explosion is heard from another part of the city. You don’t know what it is until much later. Turns out that it was Kenzer’s jewelry store. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, but you also fucked them, and we’re not doing that, so again just relax and let me take care of it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “While it would be nice to just have unlimited power to deal with everything directly, I’ve got a bunch of shit to take care of here. I trust that you’ll be fine and I trust you’ll be able to assess the situation and give me proper feedback of our best options.” <EOS>
<BOS> The slug was a simple creature, and had no delusions of grandeur; he did not view himself as mighty, noble, or wise. He did not complain that he was not honored with a piece - why should he expect to be? <EOS>
<BOS> "He insisted on giving this guy first aid," Spryce chuckles. "Wouldn't take no for an answer." <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, I ain’t no rat.” You proclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “You said the Thieves Guild is down here, surely they would have found it if this is their territory.” <EOS>
<BOS> Whatever lies in store for you, your life as a rogue has definitely ended. <EOS>
<BOS> “Safe. Pfft. I could fry her brain inside her skull with minimal effort and all her protection would be for naught.” <EOS>
<BOS> “As far as I’m concerned, you drank more than your cut back at the house! Besides, you told me you looted some body you found in one of the barrels, I’d say you came out ahead.” You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> "Goodbye, my noble hero." <EOS>
<BOS> “That would be severe pay cut and I’m not fond of the idea of running away.” <EOS>
<BOS> Seth gathers himself and goes on the offensive again. He arcs the practice blades low and swings high. You roll to your side and pull the nearest training weapon from the wall. A staff. You spin the staff in front of you to feel the weight and balance of the weapon. Then you hold it in a defensive position, readying for Seth’s next attack. <EOS>
<BOS> Heather’s face looks completely dumb struck. She has no words. You on the other hand are just shaking your head and giving a cynical laugh about it all. <EOS>
<BOS> “Do you need a decision now?” <EOS>
<BOS> And most importantly, Elana probably is carrying a purse full of coin for this trip. <EOS>
<BOS> “The man said he doesn’t need any more attention so stop hovering over him and go back over there with the rest of your class.” <EOS>
<BOS> In the biggest of these rooms, you find Madeline ordering about a few goblins in their native language. It’s weird how they don’t mind taking her orders. When they see you, they move even quicker. <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve never considered burglarizing that place before, but you suppose it makes sense that there would be some pretty valuable stuff in there. Though you imagine that it’s more protected than even some of the banks here. <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re doing so, you run into Hank who is telling his various employees to clean up the mess in the main room with the stage. He sees you and walks over. <EOS>
<BOS> “The captain who brought me here, Zamed has been privateering for the Delantium Kingdom. He was contacted by Peter who is still trying to amass a conquering force of men and ships to take back his birthright. In fact Zamed is supposed to be organizing the majority of a flotilla of Hessla privateers” <EOS>
<BOS> “Meh, knowing that one, she’ll probably develop a fantasy about you. She’s got a thing for bad boys.” <EOS>
<BOS> "What?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Take him back to his cell, release him in the morning.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that means war then, but I have to remind you, we can’t just start stabbing people in the streets. The Jicol Watch isn’t as corrupt as the Holgard Watch was, in fact they’ve been starting to become a pain in the ass and I’m getting concerned that they’re going to actually raid our headquarters one day.” <EOS>
<BOS> Vera starts immediately laughing at how someone like you fell prey to something like that. <EOS>
<BOS> While you probably could get out in time, you don’t bother, choosing to die along side your family in the same manner they died. <EOS>
<BOS> "It's odd for him to just disappear though. Maybe we should contact the militia on this." <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, so tell me about the guy who isn’t a proper assassin.” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well you’re really good at that obviously. Look, you’re not getting any problems from me or whoever else you left alive. So you want this place? Fine, I ain’t fucking dying for it.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Interesting. Has she ever had a story told, here?" <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya starts screaming at Garrick and punching him in the face while he unsuccessfully tries to fend her off. You on the other hand are now coming to realize that you’ve been shot pretty badly and your adrenaline has worn off. <EOS>
<BOS> “Bullshit kid, in your situation and first time? You probably thought about it. Don’t worry though, everyone usually does at one time or another, just as long as you don’t actually do it…well either that or make damn sure the reward is high enough.” Mr. Scars chuckles. <EOS>
<BOS> Now you roll your eyes. <EOS>
<BOS> "No. No, I get what you mean. I have to say, this is really damn ambitious. I mean I can't say I'm not impressed by your plan...but again I just have my concerns if it's going to be possible...but fuck it, I'm in." Zal says. <EOS>
<BOS> The gnarled staff pointed Ekka’s way, burning a symbol on his forehead. Ekk’a didn’t know who “he” was, but he abandoned all thoughts of what was honorable or not. Ekk’a ran, retracing the trail of blood, the mark of the demon displayed for all to see. <EOS>
<BOS> Apparently the Delantium Kingdom wizards think very highly of themselves. <EOS>
<BOS> “We’re going to war with the Syndicate? I thought everything was going well, boss.” <EOS>
<BOS> Of course you do have your trusty glasscutter with you and you could just start getting to work on grabbing what you can from the displays. <EOS>
<BOS> The mayor continues. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the fuck was wrong with me? I could have gotten myself killed, flirting like that.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, well I suppose that’s one way to explain away everything. Will it work?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, but I don’t think it’s them we should worry about. Tell me, have you ever heard of Neroth?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Mebbe dat Peter knew we weren’t really gonna help him.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Heh, yes. I thought it would be the best way to deal with this one. After Henry disposed of the Bloody Smiles, people thought there was a blood stalker lurking in the woods for years. It's amazing what people's imagination can come up with." <EOS>
<BOS> “You don’t want me to have nice things! You don’t want me to try to improve my self. You want to keep me dressed in rags, looking like shit and generally being miserable.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wasn’t planning on joining them either.” <EOS>
<BOS> “…yes.” You answer hesitantly. <EOS>
<BOS> “Do you encounter many Imperial troops?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> You run towards the temple even though some are telling you not to go in since its being targeted, but you don’t listen or care. <EOS>
<BOS> Well at least the law isn’t trying to arrest you for a change. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, this is all almost too much for you to comprehend. A few days ago you were pondering if you were meant to be here, well maybe THIS is the reason! Your ancestors are obviously having problems; maybe YOU need to fix them. <EOS>
<BOS> “All of them?” <EOS>
<BOS> You head for the east block of the town, where the Stables are. It will be the best place to buy an animal for the long journey. And while your back hurts just thinking about the hard ride ahead, it's the only way. <EOS>
<BOS> As for you, your body slumps lifelessly to the floor and will play no more role in world events whatever those may be. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe not, but I’m not following orders this time. And it’s not ONLY because these fuckers have been targeting me. These Neroth cultists are a bigger danger than the EC. Maybe they haven’t been fucking with us as long, but if their leader or high priest or whatever is fucking the Baron’s son then who is to say their goal isn’t to turn the city into a theocracy? If something like that happens I can bet that there won’t be any freedom to do anything here and they certainly aren’t going to be dealing with the likes of us and quite frankly Garrick’s an idiot if he believes he can somehow reason with them on some level, I’ve seen what the hell they do.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, her too. Anyway, even though I know I don’t have some curse on me or anything of the sort, sometimes it feels like I do.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You fly around for a bit and eventually she starts her decent downward. Because you’re not quite used to this sensation you close your eyes again almost thinking you’re going smash in the ground. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sheesh, such obvious flattery. Why don’t ya just suck his dick while ya at it?” <EOS>
<BOS> “But…you just offered to sacrifice her to cure me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “As I said, no. My wife didn’t even like the idea of making the temple a headquarters.” <EOS>
<BOS> A few days pass and the fighting is still going on and it’s not going well. The Jicol forces have managed to maintain a stalemate. Marco has apparently died in the fighting as well. <EOS>
<BOS> The pair of you land hard on the stone sewer floor with you being right on top of Vaughn. <EOS>
<BOS> "Mr. Reynolds, with all due respect, I have come here asking for assistance on this matter as I once did in the past. Your son did a marvelous job last time even if... I didn't quite appreciate its thoroughness last time. I have now come to respect it much more and I would like to implement his magnificent skills again on others that would see harm to me and my business." <EOS>
<BOS> One has a broken arm you make a splint for. Her fearful glance at Spryce before he leaves makes you suspect the source of the injury. <EOS>
<BOS> “I— I don’t understand,” you manage to say. <EOS>
<BOS> “If I take him out myself, then you might want to worry about your future in this city for rejecting my offer now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I get that idea from the fact that you have no damn proof that your dick is cursed from what you’ve told me. I mean if it really was cursed, I’d think those women would have melted shortly after or something, not died from common shit like drug overdoses or fires. You just had a string of bad luck and made assumptions.” <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Percy says a few more pleasantries and then remarks about looking forward to the meeting with you in a few days. Toz on the other hand just stares at you with the typical hostile greenskin eyes and follows Percy. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, you’ve also heard the place is filled with corruption so it would probably be a better place to do your work than Klyton. <EOS>
<BOS> “I cut you a break, and all of a sudden I get a reputation that I just let everyone walk all over me. Before I know it I got every wanderer in the region asking for handouts. No! You pay the price or get the hell outta my establishment!” the innkeeper exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> You figure that the man behind the bar is the innkeeper so you go up to him to ask how much for a room. The price he gives you is just out of your price range, too bad you can’t just “steal a room.” <EOS>
<BOS> Warts nods and leaves with his spawn who sticks his tongue at you. <EOS>
<BOS> Your face breaks into a wide grin at the implication you’re stronger than her. Brother Samuel turns your direction. “And you, the newest of the acolytes could stand to improve as well. Raw strength will only carry you so far. There’s always someone stronger.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Pardon?” <EOS>
<BOS> Days later, Seth manages to rise from bed. Through a mouthful of Sarah’s wild rice soup, he says, “They knew we were coming. I don’t know how, but they knew. We turned the corner and they were there. A whole battalion of them.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No…but it is my place to decide yours,” King Aeric answers. “You are hereby banished from this castle until you return with Seth or proof of their defeat. You have served me well in your short time here, and that’s the only reason you aren’t meeting the axe. At least this way, you have a fighting chance and will possibly do something useful. Now go!” <EOS>
<BOS> Actually, if you knew letting him out was going to lead to this end result, you would have left him there. Who knows, maybe he would have even been better off since the other Talons were supposed to get him out eventually. <EOS>
<BOS> “Pfft, liar. You DID think that. I bet you checked all your hiding spots in this room after you woke up.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe it was YOU.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sort of. He was fighting an orc and we both brought it down together.” Keira replies. <EOS>
<BOS> “So. We finally gonna fuck or what?” Vera asks, moving in a little closer on you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Again? But…shouldn’t I really get going?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> You spend the time before he arrives going about your regular business and squeezing a little extra money from the citizens under the guise of a mandatory “defense tax” so you don’t lose most of your current savings paying the wizard. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah hasn’t been gone long when you encounter more trouble. <EOS>
<BOS> You smile a bit. The baroness certainly has a way with words. <EOS>
<BOS> “If you’re already dreaming about me, I think you know the answer. I’ve pretty much imprinted on you at this point, though I suppose not completely.” Tanya replies. <EOS>
<BOS> "I need some people killed." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I nearly went in before you, because a perfect opportunity just opened up ten minutes ago. All of the guards left.” <EOS>
<BOS> With those last words, the man takes his leave and you're pondering this new possibility. <EOS>
<BOS> By the time you’re done, you feel your strength has returned enough that you can safely climb down from your position and get back to street level again. <EOS>
<BOS> Captian Brost slaps a knee. "Well! That is something. I guess we should introduce him to his patient?" He steps aside, and you can see a thick-built but whimpering, feverish man on the table. He clutches some old cloth to his lower torso, and you can see it is soaked in blood. <EOS>
<BOS> As you sit counting your ill-gotten loot from the latest traveling merchant in town, your twin sister is watching you with a slightly distracted expression. She’s been looking like that a lot lately. <EOS>
<BOS> The bodies turn to their left and let loose a series of punches and kicks. All except one. You turn right instead of left. The rest of the children break out in laughter over your mistake. <EOS>
<BOS> And so you take your next steps in building a new criminal organization. <EOS>
<BOS> Marco of course says he does and his people do as well. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh yeah? You and what army?” <EOS>
<BOS> They find you wandering, half-mad, muttering to yourself. You cannot say who you are, where you've been, or where you are headed. <EOS>
<BOS> There is a darkness within me. I feel it, growing, wanting to consume me completely. My training is what I rely on to combat it. Each day I rise before the sun, disciplining my body and mind for the upcoming battle. I’ve come to realize there are little certainties; the battle is the only exception. I must be at my sharpest each day. I know it will come. It wants full control, and sometimes it wins. My defeat only spurs me to greater heights. I learn, recognizing its tricks in order to stave them off next time. <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sigh) I thought you might say that. You’re missing the big picture.” Flynn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Before you can however, you are suddenly grabbed while passing an alley and slammed up against a wall. You’re then punched several times before you can even react and your pistol is taken away. <EOS>
<BOS> “Relax. That wasn’t a threat. That was just to get your attention. We’re not the Ebony Claw if that’s what you’re worried about.” He says. <EOS>
<BOS> You get to your humble abode and suddenly Swifty jumps off your shoulder and scurries away into a nearby crack in a wall. <EOS>
<BOS> He fills his mouth with another spoonful. “I tried to fight them off. Luckily, Richard here is pretty handy with a bow. Nice timing too.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Zal! What the fuck are you doing here?! Wait! I’ll come help you!” you shout. <EOS>
<BOS> “Do I look like I’m in a rolly box carting around a wagon full of treasures? I’m just a simple traveller down on his luck.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, it’s pirate free in that the city doesn’t have to worry about them ever attacking the place, but that doesn’t mean they can’t stop there for supplies as long as they behave. Besides, Zamed’s been more of a privateer recently, though I suppose it’s a thin line. He’s been doing a lot of work for the Delantium Kingdom in their war against Nichan. Which is something I sort of want to bring up with you because it could possibly affect the League.” <EOS>
<BOS> Then again, Warts and the hobs are what caused this mess in the first place; maybe you need to just start over somewhere else. Still, you don’t want to start completely over. This is a lot easier with help and Vera would still be pretty useful in that regard. <EOS>
<BOS> “We must make for King Aeric. If the western border has collapsed, we must inform him,” Seth says jumping down. “Come with me. It’d be best to have monk acolytes accompany me to answer any questions.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well if an invasion does occur then they’re going to be my best personal defense. You wouldn’t happen to know how long before Peter gets his shit together do you?” <EOS>
<BOS> You cautiously remove the wax from your ears and you don't hear any mermaid songs trying to bewitch you any longer. You do hear the sounds of a few birds though. Wherever you are, you're in a wooded area with a large amount of trees and bushes. <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera…” <EOS>
<BOS> You stop for a moment when Warts says that name. You still have mixed feelings, but you eventually nod. <EOS>
<BOS> And here it is, the Syndicate trying to get their foot just enough in the door. <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh? Oh Cooper? He’s not my boyfriend anymore, he ran off a couple months ago. He didn’t want to stick around during the invasion. He was a big coward after all, not like you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s not usually a problem. Besides, I learned a long time ago that it often doesn’t matter how good the lock, if someone wants in, they’re getting in.” you reply. <EOS>
<BOS> “She said she found some new species of crab when she was exploring the shores near Hessla. Said she wanted to do some extra research and get a few to bring back, but she wanted me to bring the qweepas back to you immediately. She wouldn’t hear anything else. I’m sure you know how she is.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Half of that stuff we steal is mine you know.” Your sister points out. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, I was trying to keep this part of the project a bit under wraps to surprise you. Really glad you like it. As I mentioned to Vaughn, this part was my way of saying thank you for dragging me out of the fighting ring and giving my real life meaning again." Rob says. <EOS>
<BOS> You then feel a bolt going into your back and then another one just narrowly grazing the back of your head. You fall to the floor and you probably would be dead right there if not for Tanya who has already recovered from Rook’s attack. <EOS>
<BOS> The watchman captain at this point signals to his platoon that all draw their weapons and then turns back to you as if daring you to argue. <EOS>
<BOS> While things are still pretty tense, you continue to try to get on with your business. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, we’re heading out to finish these assholes for good. You stay here and keep things running here as you do.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe if you’d warned me ahead of time it wouldn’t be fucking necessary!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I can imagine leading hell armies is pretty taxing.” <EOS>
<BOS> The more you think about it, the more you feel this is the right decision. The next day you gather Zal and Vaughn to discuss this new direction. <EOS>
<BOS> You put away your pistol and crouch down besides Vera who is still upset and probably expecting you to kill her. <EOS>
<BOS> The crowd rushes into giving you suggestions, their questions put aside in the excitement of hoping of their suggestions get chosen. For a couple of minutes they shout over each other, offering things both mundane and absurd. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, this has to wear off eventually. We’re just going to have to do something else.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah I know what they are. Overgrown ugly rats and general pests around town. If you want to know where to get some, you could try Gilo’s Gridiron. Well either that or just hang around the docks or leave some food around in a dark place. It isn’t like they’re that hard to find around here.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Well things look like they're going good for you boss. You got money, a nice business, a pretty wife even if she is a little on the older side." <EOS>
<BOS> “She thinks yer intresstin’? She really doesn’t know youz at all.” Warts snarks and chuckles at his own attempt at a joke. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, fine. But you really haven’t found ANY way to dispel my curse yet?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I thought you said the leader was here and so far this place is empty.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well…I suppose I do have an ulterior motive of sorts.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Cuz people talk shit all the time and not even realize ol’ Warts is even there to lissen. Waz in a garbage bin and heard these two weird guys in red robes talkin about it in an alley awhile back.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Heh, no…” <EOS>
<BOS> You entertain some more of Vera’s questions and the pair of you also proceed to talk about the “old days. The pair of you laughs about various events that occurred while you two worked together. <EOS>
<BOS> "Annie." <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit!” you exclaim and just barely manage to avoid getting your head smashed in. <EOS>
<BOS> “Bolt seems to have more doubt judging by his demeanor, but then dwarves tend to be skeptical by nature. Fortunately for you, dwarves are also very loyal and he won’t deviate from Rook’s orders too much.” <EOS>
<BOS> “True, but Hank could at least help you out more than he has. I mean it’s his fucking inn and the guy is just letting the place go to shit. I remember when this place was really popular.” <EOS>
<BOS> You briefly think of Vera and how she kissed you not too long ago. Makes you wonder if she’s got more than a bit of attraction toward you. You know she’s always making these sexual offers toward you, but as far as you know she’s not really known to be the “good time” girl within the Nocturnal League. So it makes you wonder if she actually feels affection towards you on some level. Sometimes you think about her too, since you work so closely together. It’s almost like you’re an old married couple. <EOS>
<BOS> Inside the cathedral of Earth, the light danced. Small animals crawled over and through the walls of trees, and several large eggs were dotted about the room. Everything hummed, somehow alive. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, she seemed nice enough.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh right. Shit.” <EOS>
<BOS> Well that answers your question. <EOS>
<BOS> Zamed snorts and sits down and you go into your plan and his place in it. Already he takes umbrage to the fact that you’re including him even though he hasn’t agreed to anything. <EOS>
<BOS> “What’re you doing here? I sort of thought if anyone was going to check up on me, it would be Sneaks.” You say putting your weapon down. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ohhh! Let’s to Klyton!” Annah says excitedly. <EOS>
<BOS> “And what would we have to talk about criminal? You’ve got enough Blue Dream here to get the entire town of Hegglesburg trashed. This seems like a pretty simple situation as far as I’m concerned. You think because you’re young, you deserve leniency? Hah! You can try it on the judge when he sentences you, but in any case you’re coming with us.” <EOS>
<BOS> A few meters down, you see a piece of cloth hanging on a sharp rock. The dark red piece must have come from Seth's robe. You were going the right way, though to be fair, down feels as good a direction as any. Several minutes later, you come across a series of broken-off rocks. You slow your descent as you imagine the surrounding area might have loose hand-holds as well. Just as your arms start to exhaust, you eye a ledge of sorts. The jutting rock couldn't be more than five inches long, but it works well enough for you to stand on, leaning your back against the rock wall behind you. You rub your arms to get the blood flowing and roll your wrists a few times. <EOS>
<BOS> You head over to Wendy's home, wondering how you're going to handle this. You really don't want to murder an old lady if you can help it, but if that's what it takes then that's what's going to have to happen. Given that she's a follower of Joachim though, you don't hold out much hope that blood isn't going to be shed. <EOS>
<BOS> You pause and realize who you’re talking to exactly. You remember at the time after everything that happened with the ECS you wondered if you’d have to deal with this man again. You never thought it would be in this capacity though. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I see. Well you ever heard of Jicol?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Not everyone was keen on our alliance with the Syndicate. In fact I was very vocal against our alliance with them. I felt it sullied our faith to associate with such criminals. Allowing some of them into our shadow magic secrets. It was a disgrace to Fel’s name. Joachimite’s foolishly believe they have the cornerstone on the concept of purity. Let me tell you, purity isn’t only found in the so called light.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wow, that’s a huge responsibility and a lot of trust in me. I’m not sure what to say, thanks I guess.” Vera says responding to you. <EOS>
<BOS> You call out to the captain, but hear no answer. This causes you to row faster with all your strength while still keeping your eyes closed. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, so how do you want to do this?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Well if you got another girl in mind then marry her instead. I only suggested myself, because I can't say I've actually seen you with a steady one and certainly not one with the intelligence to go along with this plan or back up a reasonable story. If you're worried about this meaning something else, I can assure you that this is purely a business arrangement. We can always get divorced later." <EOS>
<BOS> "Arena?" <EOS>
<BOS> “And the one with the broken finger is a bad boy?” <EOS>
<BOS> “All is lost. We can only hope to avenge them. If you decide to stay, you will be choosing death. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, you’re the Count right?” Layla utters. <EOS>
<BOS> The man suddenly grabs you by the shirt and slams you up against a nearby destroyed wall. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya hugs you, and you ignore the pain you feel when she applies her squeeze around you. She then carefully kisses you on the lips. You don’t even feel the drain. <EOS>
<BOS> “Guess I’ll remember that for the next city I oversee.” The mayor remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Though you do have another option, and that’s going to the Ebony Claw Syndicate for help. Rook called off the hit and so far other than a few unavoidable skirmishes here and there, the EC has not been actively targeting you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I’m sure because I just fired Gertrude.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You didn’t even remember to bring your weapons with you since you were in such a hurry, not that you wanted to turn this into a murder in the first place. You figure you got two options at this point, either hide or try to escape out a window. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well we need to try, because if you haven’t noticed, we are at a bit of a disadvantage. Reginald is Farrad’s boyfriend. You know, the baron’s son? The one who is probably going to attempt a coup on his father soon? If he’s actually successful it’s probably best that we’re not on his bad side at least.” Garrick retorts with annoyance. <EOS>
<BOS> “Welcome brothers. The time of the Grand Melee is upon us. This is a time where we put our disciplined training to the test. Without trial, we cannot fully understand our strength. The good King Aeric has sent his man, Seth, to observe our progress. This is a time where—” <EOS>
<BOS> “Mantis…I think I heard that name before.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe…but you didn’t have to be so mean. I cried over you for days.” Annah says. <EOS>
<BOS> Another week passes and still no sign of him at all. There haven’t even been any “mysterious” deaths. However, you soon get some not so mysterious deaths when a couple of the pirate captains kill some of your people while leaving the island. <EOS>
<BOS> “No and I told you to stop bothering me Virgil! Don’t you have a collection box you can pilfer booze money from?” you shout. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fucking asshole, get off! Get off of him!” she shouts stabbing Klint in the back several times. <EOS>
<BOS> “I want you three to pay attention, because what I do to Marco, I’ll also do to you if you choose to follow him…well not you. You can have a position in the brothel.” You say to Marco’s buddies. <EOS>
<BOS> "Just a little longer, Ivani..." you whisper. "I'm coming." <EOS>
<BOS> “I see. Well would you have any problems with me poking about the place?” Zalmora asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You take a quick peek and see that it’s Annah stomping through the underbrush with the grace of a clumsy horse. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm surprised you came back," he whispers. "Some mages passed through an hour ago, asking about you. It isn't safe." <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, sounds like a plan.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Hmm, well luckily for you you've got his looks apparently." <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t believe I know that one. Okay, go ahead.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Do as you like," she shrugs. "Story-time is over, it was only meant to go until one. Slip in now while everyone's still here, and you might make some coin. But don't get your hopes up." <EOS>
<BOS> Of course the other side paints you out to be evil incarnate whenever they can. Klint’s parents in particular. <EOS>
<BOS> The voice appears in your mind. You shake it off, using your breath to focus on the present moment rather than the internal whispers. The demon awaits. <EOS>
<BOS> “I want you to gather the best and most skilled assassin types we have and send them to kill those two ECS fuckers. Then I want you to send a group of twenty more of the next best along with them. I don’t care how they’re killed, just do it quickly. Also I want all ships to not leave this fucking island until they’re dead. We are not fucking this up.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m sorry, I’m sorry for everything. I…I gotta go.” You say as you leave your mother crying and go to climb out your window. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm. Well I guess I just see her as another corrupt aristocrat that used her position of power to gain even more power. Not that that’s a bad thing, but nothing special. Lot harder to do when you aren’t born with a silver spoon in your mouth.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No. I just said I was glad that you weren’t, why the hell would I be?” <EOS>
<BOS> Honestly, you think Annah’s enthusiasm to go to Klyton is a little misplaced even if she wasn’t travelling with a wanted murderer. At least she isn’t bitching anymore though. <EOS>
<BOS> This is a really difficult situation. As much as Elana has been a complete bitch to you, you aren’t sure if her getting sold into slavery isn’t disproportionate retribution. <EOS>
<BOS> “What about the egg?” <EOS>
<BOS> You pack up all your important shit, along with some of your savings and immediately make your way to the carriage station. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s one hell of a tale Dusk.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> So those are your choices and they both sound shitty. Honestly, you wish you could just take care of Jake yourself, but Tom is probably right about the fact that something like that isn’t really your specialty, but talking to others and trying to convince them to do what you want is apparently a newer one you’ve acquired or at least one you’ve been thrust into. <EOS>
<BOS> She goes on to say she isn’t going to tell you her life story, but she wants to make it clear that while you’re probably right on some level about her finding a thrill in all this, she’s genuinely interested in his project from a scholastic point of view too. Namely helping you build an underground headquarters will give her some “life experience” and real chance to use what she’s learning and has already learned especially since she doesn’t hold out hope that she’s going to get a “real job” after she graduates. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m…coming home…Joachim…I see his light…” Yinen remarks and then he dies. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I used to go to primary and high school with him. I was one of his friends during childhood. I mean sure we drifted apart obviously, even more so when I dropped out altogether, but me and him were always alright with each other! I heard he moved to Teckleville years ago and had a family. Didn’t know his son was a thief though…how the hell did that happen?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I get it, but I really need to talk to your high priest or whoever is in charge.” <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t even ask how he knows who you are. <EOS>
<BOS> "A snake?" Barus asked. "We did not give this one part of the map." <EOS>
<BOS> "I accept," you say, and leave the library a far happier and richer man. With steady work in your future, you even allow yourself to stay at a nice, but modest, Inn at 5 silver a night. <EOS>
<BOS> After this experience, you are shown your new cell. You cellmate is surprisingly a Halfling! Though within the first five minutes of meeting him he’s quite firm about stating what is his and warns you that he’s not going to tolerate any shit from the likes of you. <EOS>
<BOS> “No. Tanya’s in the past. Has been for a long time. She left me long ago to seek her destiny in hell. This, is all me, though perhaps I am being influenced by another woman in my life, but then I have a son with her, so you could say I’m securing a future with my family.” <EOS>
<BOS> Rob stands on top of a high platform near one of the walls and waves. <EOS>
<BOS> “If you hadn’t been so much of a fanatic, you might have had a few more friends to help you now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Possibly, but it’s only been a year and things still aren’t really settled yet in this city. He’s probably just waiting it all out a little longer. In any case, what was it that you wanted to suggest?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you no longer feel a wooden floor but cold stone. As you are continually dragged across the cellar area, you are now starting to black out. Your only thoughts are that you hope Tanya will be okay and save your ass on top of everything else. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s of minor importance. However, you might be right, she might still be a little too sweet on you and I doubt if she’ll believe any story I come up with. Better to just not bother picking her up. Oh well. It was good while it lasted, but as for you, you’re on your way out.” <EOS>
<BOS> But you can’t hate her for that. It wasn’t her fault. It just was her nature. <EOS>
<BOS> “They aren’t exactly forth coming with information. Our relationship isn’t the most open. I don’t even know if they’re planning on sabotaging Peter this time like I’ve been told they have in the past.” <EOS>
<BOS> Since you’re not exactly in the mood to breath in Yellow Devil fumes right now, you decide to go see Madeline first who as far as you know is overseeing work on the other location. You might as well check on that while you’re at it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe, but I enjoyed what time there was. Besides, you said it yourself that we’re bonded. So our time together isn’t really over, it’s just different I suppose.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hello, lover.” She hisses. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh come on, I told you a long time ago that I wasn’t actually going to do that.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I think you need to elaborate on that one.” <EOS>
<BOS> "They have your portrait hung up on a persons-of-interest board. Some mage probably took note of you in Pefallis." <EOS>
<BOS> Still, it wasn’t something she wanted to necessarily embrace, so for the next few days it was nothing but arguments with her and her new found demonic mother. Meanwhile her father was preparing your soul to present to her. Madeline still didn’t even know you were dead at this time. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya’s reaction is one of shock. For a moment it looks like she’s going to punch you, but then she just shakes her head and actually chuckles. You think it’s the first time you’ve seen her remotely laugh. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe not, but I’m not handing over my son to you.” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> The deed done, you drop the staff and sob. A cry of rage and sorrow seems to emanate from the soil, and you join it in mourning. <EOS>
<BOS> You then hear a loud explosion coming from below, the entire boat rocks and you fall to the deck. You aren't sure what happened, but it can't be good because the smell of smoke is very prominent and while you aren't entirely sure yet, but you think the boat might be starting to sink. <EOS>
<BOS> The bear paused, startled. "Oh, yes, I must have drooped it." He wiped his stained mouth with a paw. "Keep it if you want. I give up. Just don't give it to any of those conceited fools." The bear returned to his munching, and the snail headed back to his lunch. He pondered the map fragment as he ate. Something about the wiggling lines on it seemed familiar. What if, instead of a route, the final map merely showed the final destination - and it was somewhere recognizeable to them all? There were only a few places that every animal would know: the watering hole at peaceful lake, where almost everyone bathed and socialized; the great tree of Speaking at the center of the garden, which boref fruit that granted the power of speech; and the clearing of assembly, where the gods would sometimes descend to address the creatures they had placed in the garden. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh fuck you, you’re a fucking thief and drug dealer. You’re in no position to judge me! And I’m not a murderer.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, though I know you’ve sold shit to the Bloody Talons in the past, surprised you haven’t heard any of them talking about me in passing. Or more likely bitching about me.” <EOS>
<BOS> You spend tomorrow mostly “taking the day off.” You go get something to eat a few times, but that’s about it. You still don’t see Virgil, but you do have a vague feeling that someone is watching you every time you leave the damn inn. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well we’ll still have the coin and we can still restart in Jicol with all new people. Or it can just end up being just us. I don’t care. My mental well being and my relationship with you is more important than coin.” <EOS>
<BOS> Soon several hands grab your limp body and pull it off the spiked trap. At this point any remaining life your body might have had is gone and you don’t even hear the further taunts of Warts or his hobgoblin buddies. <EOS>
<BOS> “How did you know it was me anyway?” <EOS>
<BOS> You see a girl wearing nothing but a black open cloak. All her fun parts are fully exposed to you, save for her face, which is partially hidden due to a hood over the top half of her head. Long white hair can be seen peeking out though. They did a pretty good job in matching your description. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” <EOS>
<BOS> But you haven't said good-bye to anyone in the main village, and they are the ones who have supported you all these years. The children, especially, are fond of your tales, even as their parents grow jaded through the years, remembering the times when stories could be told over and over. And Talsum, the closest person you have to a best friend, lives at the bakery in town. <EOS>
<BOS> Wasting no time, you enter the room and shoot Rook several times with your pistol. He doesn’t even know what hit him as the bullets hit his body and he slumps to the floor. <EOS>
<BOS> Rook finally turns his attention back to you. <EOS>
<BOS> Instead however, she lands near the abandoned and semi-ruined inn the Lighthouse and places you on one of the empty beds there. <EOS>
<BOS> Visibly unhappy, Richard drops the leash end of the rope, no longer needing to hold Mira captive. Giving your shoulder one last reassuring squeeze, Seth exits the tent along with Richard. The image of Seth’s melting face comes back to your mind. <EOS>
<BOS> “Count? Oh. Right, Vera, Countess, whatever. No, unlike my wife, I see no need for formal titles. You’re my son’s new sitter from what she’s told me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, you don’t kill him right away. YOU marry him, THEN you kill him. That way you’ll get the inn without any hassle.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “You guys seem to have a handle on that, besides don’t really feel like celebrating with Jake.” You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> Though you half wonder if Percy eventually got to these folks anyway. Perhaps promising a reward from the Syndicate if they got him off the island. If that’s the case, you can only hope he was on the ship you managed to sink. <EOS>
<BOS> What now? You head back for the city, but it will be near midnight by the time you get back - too late to tell stories in an Inn, or anywhere, to get some coin. But, perhaps, you could trade the brooch itself? It's worth a try. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well what about the other stuff?” <EOS>
<BOS> “This guy’s talking bullshit. I dunno what his game is, but I don’t like his story and I think you should kill him.” Lloyd says. <EOS>
<BOS> Did it feel like this, for Ivani? you wonder before all thoughts fade. <EOS>
<BOS> "I don't know," he admits, "I'm new to the area myself, still getting used to it. The Wyrm Empress pays well for entertainment, but I didn't make it through the audition process. You not only have to perform well, but she expects a gift even for the chance to serve her. I suppose I'll head to one of the local taverns or Inns - there are over a dozen in Scaleport, they can't all have dedicated entertainment. You should do the same, I guess." He finishes packing up his things and shrugs. <EOS>
<BOS> "Pfft, he didn't lose them, he knows exactly where they are. In his old bitch of a wife's purse!" Another Talon remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'll be sure to avoid anything with even a hint of a moral," you say. <EOS>
<BOS> This comment makes Rook smirk a little. <EOS>
<BOS> Various Crimson Talon members stop what they’re doing to watch this spectacle. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck, of course I can feel, my whole fucking body hurts, especially my back. As far as moving around is concerned, yeah, I can, but I don’t fucking want to. See? I’m moving my foot!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Up! Go back! Up! We gotta… HRUP!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright, alright, if you trust her then I guess that’s good enough for me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No way you can stay a little longer I guess.” <EOS>
<BOS> Your time aboard the Traveller goes by slowly as there isn’t much to do except wait. You don’t interact much with Zamed and the rest of the crew for obvious reasons. The only thing Zamed tells you is you’re heading towards an island with a small fishing town called Seabreeze which is under Delantium dominion. Peter apparently wants to keep major meetings with criminals away from the mainland for whatever reason. <EOS>
<BOS> Soon… <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s even worse since I AM the Temple’s leadership this time. Shortly after the ECS started to collapse with the death of their boss which I have no doubt you had a hand in, there was another debate on whether or not help. It was then when I decided that our temple should seize the chance to discard our alliance and go back to basics. Let’s just say the disagreement with the leadership at the time got heated and I took our temple back to what it should be focusing on.” Shade says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Hey you with the hood." A voice says. <EOS>
<BOS> "I hate to say this, but I don't think Camid's going to just go away." Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 28 <EOS>
<BOS> “Warts, step out of here. While there won’t be any dick sucking involved, I am sort of interested in why Vera wants to go so badly.” <EOS>
<BOS> Your sister pats you on the shoulder. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thanks. I didn’t expect any help, least of all from you.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Great. I suppose that will come in useful when we finally get to Klyton. (Sigh) Okay, I brought some food, mostly fruit, and water, so I guess you can have some of that. Don’t eat and drink all of it though…and before you even start, NO I’m not implying anything about your damn weight. I just don’t know how much further it is to Klyton.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re joking right? I could steal, and have stolen items a lot more valuable than this!” <EOS>
<BOS> “(Groan) I knew lighting that fire was a bad idea.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point you’re practically his second in command anyway and you’re still baffled by this since you haven’t been here nearly as long, though you suppose with all these new folks coming in, you are starting to become a “vet” as it were. <EOS>
<BOS> You return to the inn and explain the situation to Zal and Vaughn. Vaughn says it shouldn't be any problem to locate where Camid and the rest finally settle down at, though he says once again that it will most likely be the old sewer location. <EOS>
<BOS> You turn around and see a large older man standing in the entryway with a small axe in his hand. You just can’t catch a break. <EOS>
<BOS> Your couple of days of travel are uneventful. Just you and an empty road. When night falls you always get off the road and attempt to find a safe place to sleep in the trees nearby. Though you never really sleep easily and are constantly waking up at various sounds. <EOS>
<BOS> “Rook! I know you’re under a lot of stress right now, but listen to reason! I…” <EOS>
<BOS> With that last threat, Rook takes his leave, you don’t feel the crossbow anymore so you slowly turn around, but as expected nobody is there. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re pretty much fucked either way, but you’re going to gamble that Rook will be satisfied with revealing your plan, with some embellishments of course. <EOS>
<BOS> “And me what? Oh you still worried about the whole curse thing? Obviously I’m still here and doing fine, so obviously your concern is misplaced. I told you that you’ve probably been living like a monk for years for no reason and there is no curse. We could’ve been having fun a long time ago, but better late than never right?” <EOS>
<BOS> You part ways with Ahmed and feeling slightly more upbeat you rush out of the magic school and head back to the inn where you find Claire speaking with a couple people. <EOS>
<BOS> Chaos. The portal takes you into the monastery’s courtyard. Arriving, you quickly dodge from a flying spear. The bodies of the invading soldiers are beginning to completely cover the courtyard floor. You breathe a sigh of relief when you don’t see any fallen monks. The monks appear to be fighting well, but the sheer number from the mountainside is too many to count. <EOS>
<BOS> “This ain’t fucking enough! You’ve murdered this asshole right in my damn hotel! This is fucking serious! I run a clean place here.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. Yeah sure.” <EOS>
<BOS> The next day you go over to Wendy's house and complete the transaction. <EOS>
<BOS> Dusk with some effort tells you about his conflict with both of the wizards. The way he tells it is actually pretty impressive. You doubt if you could have faced two wizards like that. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeeah…I imagine that would suck. So they died during that conflict?” <EOS>
<BOS> You follow him down the short steps into the narrow tunnel. There isn’t any visible light, so Seth pulls a candle from beside the shrine and takes it with you. You march along in silence and near darkness. The occasional rat scurrying by is the only change in setting. After a few hours, the tunnel begins to incline slightly and you feel a subtle breeze. By now, the candle has long burned out. You follow behind Seth with your arms in front, grazing his back for direction. You keep your steady pace until he stops, suddenly, causing you to bump into his back. <EOS>
<BOS> "Perhaps we should cancel you speaking, tonight," the owner whispers to you. "We just heard the news of the riot in Aselthorne. The Mage Academy was set on fire, and the water mages had unexpected difficulty putting it out." She swallows, patting your hand. "The Head Mage is dead. It's going to be chaos - you should just lie low and leave, don't aggravate them." <EOS>
<BOS> “Grh, I still don’t trust dem shadow guyz. Dey used ta be allied wit da Syndicate.” <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, you’re not meeting this guy unless he comes directly to you and when that happens. You’re going to be… <EOS>
<BOS> “Tru…but they probably gettin’ demselves killed by warring with da elves. Sides, ain’t nobody gonna follow youz. Youz a jinx remember? Anyone left from the Syndicate isn’t likely ta like ya.” <EOS>
<BOS> You do so, and find the interior small, but opulent to the point of nonsense. A large, stuffed boar's head stars at you from over the captain's head. <EOS>
<BOS> Finally it gets to your turn. You begin to step forward and feel a hand stop you. You turn to find Brother Samuel. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t really have long conversations with Talon assholes. I generally just want them to buy their shit and go murder an old lady or whatever it is they do nowadays. In fact, are they still even around? Last I heard a shitload of them got killed two months ago in a big Klyton militia raid. Including their leader Jake.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you arrive you find it strange you don’t see any goblins running around going about their digging and building. In fact it’s completely empty until you find Madeline sitting against the wall. She looks up when you enter the room. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t reply to that and instead just keep quiet, not wishing to dwell on any potential bedroom failings on your part, let alone Jake’s dick. <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh? What?” you answer. <EOS>
<BOS> Well this just goes to show how wet behind the ears you still are that you never thought that you’d been in a Thieves Guild haven the whole time. Even Warts managed to fool you. Though it does explain a few things. Maybe this whole thing was a test. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the hell are you on about?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, so maybe Jake’s no rat, but what about some of others with him? I mean sure, we’ve all stressed how important loyalty is to the new recruits, but if Jake’s gained their trust somehow, then they’re loyal to him not to the Talons and they aren’t going to think twice about ratting us out to save their own skin.” <EOS>
<BOS> Yinen turns around and before you know it, your pistol burns so hot in your hand that you drop it. You go for your blade, but once again you burn your hand. <EOS>
<BOS> "So wait, am I still wanted there?" You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hank? You, okay?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re pondering your possible future here, you get a knock on the door. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I suppose that’s reasonable. So, I need to get married huh? Never thought it would be under these circumstances. I’m just wondering what priest is going to be willing to do it though. I mean most of those Joachimite fuckers are so puritanical that they might refuse based on Hank being so zonked. And I doubt if Hank will be up to walking to city hall. We might have to dry him out and if we do that, he might not necessarily be in the frame of mind to marry me.” <EOS>
<BOS> A wall of white and gold awaits you. You tear through their ranks like a sieging ram. Your sword cuts through Imperial soldiers, finding vulnerable spots in their armor. Each swing of your blade either sets up or finds the killing blow. Using the power Lorthander honed, you back up the deadly display of swordsmanship with dark magic, illuminating your sword in a shadowy purple flame. The magic eats through the Imperials’ armor like flame into dry parchment. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay. Deal. But I don’t want to know about what you’re going to do to Hank exactly and I want his body taken care of because that’s not something I want any part of.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, get up! We need to get out of here, before more of these assholes show up.” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> Zal soon breaks up the silence though. <EOS>
<BOS> "He was actually pretty reasonable last time." Zal remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> After sending your agenr off, once again you play the waiting game. During this time you’re pretty paranoid, expecting ECS assassins to strike at any moment. You increase security and generally don’t get much sleep. <EOS>
<BOS> She then wipes her eyes and stands up. <EOS>
<BOS> Lacking any other plan, you go with Gwen’s and start trying to move the various desks, tables, chairs and cabinets agaist the door. You can hear shouting on the other side to which you yell back for them to blow the damn door open and get their asses in here. <EOS>
<BOS> “I know.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s rather short sighted, wizards can be useful allies in case of an attack.” <EOS>
<BOS> The Dornan Temple doesn’t even have their usual lookout standing outside, though you imagine the Dornans have some sort of magical detection going on and this plan has already been expected. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s a tempting offer, but if you double cross everyone you’re going to soon find yourself with enemies on all sides. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well if you think that’s best.” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well let’s get on with that then, because that actually sounds like a lot of fun.” <EOS>
<BOS> Well at least you THINK you were maintaining a low profile... <EOS>
<BOS> “Heh, well that’s a start…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Four times? Fuck, that is fucking sexy…” The masked woman says and begins to touch herself while looking over your direction. <EOS>
<BOS> “That was part of it I suppose. Imagine my surprise that I found out it was you of all people starting up a new organization here. All my old thoughts of remembering how you and Tanya betrayed all of us…well that made me feel like something needed to be done to stop you. If you had just been some random asshole, I wouldn’t have bothered.” <EOS>
<BOS> However, the fateful day comes when you do finally have a sound sleep, when you open your eyes however, you are met with a grisly sight on the floor of your room. <EOS>
<BOS> You slowly slump to the floor trying to process everything and you can’t do it. You just stutter a couple of words and trail off. <EOS>
<BOS> There is still a world of struggling humans who cannot dream, whose past is in danger of vanishing with the stories they tell. In her place, you will inspire them to move ahead, whether a solution can be found or not. Even without the dreams of the night, they can build the dreams of the day. And even without stories, humanity can still go forward. <EOS>
<BOS> “I spoke with Garrick a little in an attempt to calm him down, but the man was a complete emotional wreck. He practically begged me to kill him at that point since he claimed he couldn’t go on living the way he was living. So I honored his wishes. It was the least I could do.” <EOS>
<BOS> The top part of her costume is off and you’re about ready to go fondle her tits. In fact you’re already standing up from the bed and walking towards her to do just that. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera begins to lower herself. <EOS>
<BOS> Kragan Firehand then leads you from the audience chamber. As you go, you note the beautiful woman glance your way as the old wizard’s back is turned. She gives you a look up and down and then smiles, before going back to filing her nails <EOS>
<BOS> “I saw Brother Trevor and Seth head towards the library. If anyone knows what to do, it’s them.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I was on my way back home. Shortly after we separated I wandered and talked to a few people and even looked around seeing if I could steal anything, but there really wasn’t a good opportunity, and then something weird happened.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> “If the Governor of Hessla doesn’t like it, he can go get fucked. He doesn’t own the fucking ocean. In fact up until recently he practically had free reign on this part of the world. Not my damn fault that he just sat around getting fat and thinking his monopoly would never end. That’s why his shithole of his is starting to become a ghost town.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the hell?” Vera says waking up next to you. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora walks away. <EOS>
<BOS> “You need to finish now! Hurry!” Heather suddenly shouts before returning to her chanting. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, well maybe another time. Anyway you take care, okay?” <EOS>
<BOS> When you get closer to where the entrance would be located you start to wonder where anyone is since surely there would be guards or lookouts posted outside to let people in (or keep people out). <EOS>
<BOS> “So, you’re the twin sister I’ve heard about over the years. Were you planning on staying for a long stretch of time?” <EOS>
<BOS> “No easy task? What would you call that business in Leifhelm then? Or the Imperial mage in Felgrown Keep? And the conjurer in Vern?--" <EOS>
<BOS> “Captain Nimi of the Seadragon.” A weathered looking elf with odd coral looking armor says. <EOS>
<BOS> Zamora nods her head. <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t imagine that you’ve changed that much since you’ve surprisingly haven’t even killed anyone since being here. You’ve stolen a lot of things, but is any of that really going to make a difference in the long run? <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, I mean I dunno what else there really is to do here. I mean we came, we saw, we met the baroness. I mean we covered all the important shit. Not like I really have any desire to talk to any of the other assholes around here.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Sheesh, did he have the miners dig all the way to Nichan? How deep is this going?" Zal remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> While you could just start jumping back into the action, you’d still rather have some back up and the only place you’re going to be certain to find some is back at the Nocturnal League’s headquarters where you’re probably going to find the rest of your remaining members hiding or attempting to wait this out. Good thing you’re already not in the greatest of moods because you don’t imagine it getting any better when you have to deal with your “employees.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You know what I mean! What does the future hold for us? How long before dad just gets fed up and tells the town guard to throw us in jail for our own good?” <EOS>
<BOS> You manage to sink one of the ships, but one manages to sail away. This situation is getting bad for business because opening fire on your usual partners is a sure way to have them never come back or worse seek revenge. <EOS>
<BOS> Now alone, you briefly check the rest of the brothel for any remaining survivors. You don’t find any, but you do tell the couple that Warts mentioned to go find a better place to hide if they can. <EOS>
<BOS> “Finally. Hey you asshole! Why the hell did you slap my hand?” Annah says, hitting you back. <EOS>
<BOS> You and Seth nod. <EOS>
<BOS> “Uhh, Hank, all of them were guys.” <EOS>
<BOS> Which means you need someone new to run the place, or at least do all the actual “inn” shit. The problem is Hank hasn’t been able to keep many steady employees ever since his severe downslide. In fact the ONLY person that’s still hanging around with him is Amanda, the awful poet that he was sticking his dick in on a regular basis when you first got here. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thank you. You look…appropriate too.” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s funny because you’re actually giving Vera what she’s always wanted; it’s just that she’s not going to like the end result. It’s almost like you’re stabbing her to death considering you’re practically killing this woman with your cock right now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Best coin you’ll ever spend. Anyway as I was saying, I wasn’t just good, I dare say I was damn near the best. I could talk of some of those so called master slavers from Hessla into a deal in my favor. Always felt a great sense of accomplishment when I took advantage of one of those fat bastards. I think I never got a chance to truly shine though because Elias was a controlling asshole, but with you I know this will be different. Everything is different now that we’re finally together.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You don’t give the damn orders here! Nobody gets in to see Rook without his say so! So you’re just going to have wait until one of us goes to see if it’s okay first and I don’t particularly feel motivated to do so and neither does anyone else, let alone for the likes of you.” <EOS>
<BOS> Still, you aren’t totally dismissing that idea. Vera usually has good instincts about this sort of thing so it might very well be a good idea to get the hell out of Holgard. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fine, but whatever I find I’m keeping. You stay here and continue getting drunk seeing that that’s what you’re good at.” You say and make your way up the stairs while Warts continues to do what you suggested. <EOS>
<BOS> You rest a moment and figure afterwards you’ll get your bearings though you’re now so drained that the moment you lay up against a tree and close your eyes, you fall asleep. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re fumbling to at least get your underwear and pants back on, Tanya looks around again, still staying in the circle of course. She examines the gory chunks of flesh that once were Vera and reaches down with a taloned hand. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey where are you going deep thinker? Aren’t you going to celebrate our successful job?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Zal, I’m not going to argue about this anymore. Things are going just fine, you’re just finding shit to nitpick about.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Giving you what you obviously need. Hope you find someone better.” You say and start pushing Annah towards the door who is resisting the whole time. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well don’t just stand there with a stupid look on your face, we need to get the hell out here and at least take a robe off of one of these assholes and put it on. I’ve seen way more of you than I ever wanted to!” <EOS>
<BOS> Do not fear me, child. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well all your attempts at going in for the kill immediately have failed so maybe a new approach is what is needed.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> “Depends. What are you guys selling?” <EOS>
<BOS> “You really think the Syndicate is going to just accept you back into its ranks?” you respond. <EOS>
<BOS> "Um, these support beams. I just touched this one and it doesn't feel secure. Is this place even safe?" Zal asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Duly noted. I’ll be there soon. Just let them know.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s not a bad idea, though I’ve never left Holgard. There’s also the fact that you have some unfinished business with the Ebony Claw Syndicate. Aren’t you worried they might hunt you down?” <EOS>
<BOS> The hermit nods, looking satisfied. "Put not your trust in outward beauty, nor despise the plain." <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, maybe this is just not something I feel comfortable with.” <EOS>
<BOS> From behind a hidden crevice, Richard reveals a torch and lights the tip. Flame bursts into the dark cave, sending shadows dancing on the walls. Upon reaching the bottom, a single tunnel lies directly ahead of you. The tunnel leads further into the cave, and eventually it opens into a spacious cavern. Several huts line the walls, constructed and stacked into the stone. Richard extinguishes the torch and places it on a metal ring near the edge of the cavern. The entire area is lit with several green flames. The magical light provides more than enough light to fill the space, and shines the village in its viridian glow. <EOS>
<BOS> The serpent, a humble brown creature whom no one considered strong or beautiful or skilled, had not been given a piece - nor had he expected one. Yet one day as he slithered, he discovered a fragment of parchment, and understood immediately what it was. Here was his chance to prove himself! But there were eleven other pieces to the map - how was he to acquire them? <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You fucking asshole! You kicked my dog!” <EOS>
<BOS> "I think it over," you say noncommittally, shuddering inwardly. That might be an option of last resort. <EOS>
<BOS> “Psst.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I DO know that! I’ve done far more studies and forgotten more about infernals than you’ll ever know and there is one constant, they always…ALWAYS become creatures of mayhem, chaos and destruction in one way or another, and have no affection for ANYONE, let alone anyone far weaker than themselves.” <EOS>
<BOS> Ludmilla takes your hand, though you don’t get an impression of an attempt at seduction or attraction, just more of a way of getting your attention. It’s working. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh of course. The rumors about Peter’s invasion are he won’t be ready for another year at least.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What was that for?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Brother Samuel approaches the boy to check for signs of vitality. His fingers check for a pulse. It’s there, but barely. As Samuel leans to pick the boy up, a chill runs down his spine. He feels another’s presence. Samuel slowly brings his gaze up in front of him. A figure, masked in shadowy wisps, stands unmoving before him. Two crimson eyes peer through the darkness directly on Samuel. <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve heard of those before. Klyton apparently uses them when the jails are full and the criminal hasn’t done anything bad enough to deserve outright death. So they get put in these cages until they eventually die of starvation, exposure or someone grants the mercy of killing them. Either way they aren’t the city’s problem anymore. Seems like it would be kinder to kill them immediately. <EOS>
<BOS> Once again you obey the man with the crossbow and enter the nearby alley where once again, you see Rook. <EOS>
<BOS> “The plans to move our activities to mainly outside Klyton, yes. The rest of it, I’d keep a lid on until later. It will be better to not overwhelm him with suggestions. So, you ready for another round stud, or do we have to waste more time talking?” <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you get over to Wendy's house and knock on the door. You hear a lot of grumbling as you wait. <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad to hear it, but will you at least think about our offer? If you change your mind, just let Yinen know. In any case, pleasure meeting you and doing business. Hope we can do it again on a regular basis.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I believe you.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Excellent. We can add another tavern to our list." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You didn’t recognize it immediately, but this man’s voice is familiar, You then also notice the crossbow he’s holding. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright Vera, I’ll meet with Peter. However, I want you to stay here.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure, I understand…just let me…whoops.” You say and drop a few of your gold coins on the ground. The guard slowly picks one up. <EOS>
<BOS> It isn’t exactly a quick or dignified death, but at least you didn’t die in a cell. <EOS>
<BOS> Since you’re not exactly in danger of starving or anything and the woods themselves seem fairly safe, you decide to play it cautiously by staying in the woods for the rest of the day and travel in the open at night. Hopefully it won’t be a much longer trek to Klyton. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, two young pretties today. Guess Yag’s really rolling well for me for a change. Hm, he looks like he’s almost on his way out. Guess we better do him quick unless we want to add necrophilia to our agenda. Fuck it, might still do that, day’s early. Anyway, let’s get his pants off and I’ll start sucking. Hey have his bitch watch, she might learn something so she can satisfy the rest of you boys.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No. In fact you’re acting really fucking suspicious just waiting around on the road like this. I’m warning you right now that if this some sort of ambush tactic, you and your bandit buddies are far from equipped to take us on. And I can guarantee YOU are going to be the first one to die.” One mercenary says as he points his crossbow at you. <EOS>
<BOS> “I guess she didn’t tell you about me. She never does. (Sigh) Even after all I’ve done for her. Though I suppose if she had talked about me, you would have thought twice about being with her and that would have been a shame…because I know how much you make her happy and she’s going to need that bit of happiness to hang on to where she’s going.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Because you’ve got something far more magical than a pair of glorified horse balls. You’ve got ties to the infernal realm! You were marked by a succubus!” <EOS>
<BOS> Fortunately there are always a lot of parties going on and this weekend there is a big one that everyone is supposed to be excited to go to, so you figure that’s the best time to strike. <EOS>
<BOS> He screams, wails and flails around the room for a moment before you tackle him back down to the floor. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, you feel like you’ve already invested a bit in this organization by sticking around this long so you’re not willing to bail out just yet, but something is going to have to change soon and you’re going to bring it up to Tom. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re right about that one, in fact that’s why I’m proposing you need a new ally and abandon your old ones.” <EOS>
<BOS> This ultimatum is met with some silence and then the four of them begin whispering amongst themselves. It’s actually sort of amusing to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “This keep has never been conquered. The walls would hold firm even if the Emperor himself shows up.” <EOS>
<BOS> You look on helplessly as Mr. Reynolds slowly puts his hand into your chest and pulls out your still beating heart. He then thanks Ahmed for this and says he will definitely honor his agreement to push magic as a greater force in this city. <EOS>
<BOS> “But, what if I target you first? I mean I’m already thinking about it!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Something like that I suppose. I’m actually just checking out my options right now. You know, to see what I might be interested in.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What? Where do you get that idea from?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, no actually, I just got lost. I’m trying to find my way out of this place.” <EOS>
<BOS> You enter your room and collapse on your bed. Your qweepa scurries off your body and onto the bed to sniff around. You watch the creature for a little while and then pet it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh come on! I don’t see what the hell is wrong with me! I mean shit; you act like I got the fucking plague! You’re a real fucking asshole you know that?” <EOS>
<BOS> You turn around a see a scruffy man wearing a rag on his head, shabby clothing and a few tattoos on his arms. A cutlass hangs by his side. He looks appropriately piratey. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya, you forget that…” <EOS>
<BOS> You know she can’t be concerned about getting into trouble. The pair of you have been doing this since you were kids. You’ve got this routine down pretty well at this point. <EOS>
<BOS> At one point you actually blurt out: <EOS>
<BOS> like you’ll be going to war with the Syndicate. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tell me more about Unarmed Combat,” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ve been fucking killing EC members since I joined and I just shot one of their leaders in the face. Fairly certain I’m on your side.” <EOS>
<BOS> The next day you explain the situation to Vera and Warts. Neither one is exactly enthused about the idea, but they’re just glad you’re not asking either of them to do it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Klint, contrary to what the rumors are, none of that happened you sick fuck. Look, just go home before something bad happens…” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck you, I’m a fucking fantastic thief! I was part of the Guild AND the Syndicate!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah an maybe the elf queen will let me fuck her in the ass while we’re at it. This is a lot of bullshit. I’m doing fine on my own.” <EOS>
<BOS> Tom doesn’t seem to care about it anymore. He’s not exactly happy, but he seems to have an “oh well” approach and isn’t concerning himself with the situation any longer. <EOS>
<BOS> Well given what the captain said happened, you at least HOPE you won't be encountering them. <EOS>
<BOS> Several men with crossbows suddenly materialize on the roofs nearby and a few of them even on the roof you’re currently on. You both instantly duck down and try to find cover. <EOS>
<BOS> The bullet isn’t even very big, but they don’t need to be when they hit something vital. <EOS>
<BOS> “Flynt! Been awhile since you’ve stopped by. You want the usual?” Ren remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey wait! Can’t we talk about this?!” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, I wasn’t unsuccessful. I’ve got something that supposedly will help against this Inquisitor, but it’s a one shot deal. The next step is speaking with Shade again though and how we’re going to set up this attack.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “And it appears that you’ve been marked for quite awhile. Succubi aren’t known for keeping their mortal mates alive for very long. Maybe a year a most and most non-magical humans can’t withstand the drain for extended periods of time. How did you pull this off? Nevermind, you can tell Flynn all about it when I bring you to him, he’ll be just as interested in all this as I am.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I…I really don’t know what to say…I mean thank you of course, but why are you doing this? What’s in it for you?” <EOS>
<BOS> “But this is really important! It’s about the Blue Dream! Your sergeant will want to hear this!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah, you’ve got the crotch rot then, okay then I’ll pass. Look, while all this has been amusing, I’m not here for either one of you snotnosed brats, I’m here to see Heather.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, an’ more people are starting to join. Maybe not in their fighting ranks, but that isn’t our problem. What IS our problem is these folks are the same ones preaching for purity and living a clean life to everyone. We’re going to start having serious complications if they win and have complete influence over the city as the only religion.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What’d you expect? We can’t just open the front gates under siege,” one of the guards aptly points out. <EOS>
<BOS> Doesn’t work though, Tanya’s ass is literally saving your own. Eventually you manage to get to the roof where you and Tanya both start leaping across the tops of nearby buildings. When you get far enough away, Tanya at last stops to take a breather and then also punches you in the face. <EOS>
<BOS> You point to the old hermit, and ask him what animal he thinks solved the puzzle of the gods. <EOS>
<BOS> “If you don’t want to take over and you don’t like how I’m running things, why don’t you just leave then? Not like I’m going to try to kill you for leaving.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Just as Bolt follows his orders loyally, I do as well. Not to Rook, but to the Temple and ultimately to Fel. My immediate superior told me to perform a task and that’s to help the Ebony Claw against its enemies wherever possible. It so happens that Rook is the head of the EC so if he wants us elsewhere and for you to stay here, who am I to argue? Perhaps I have misjudged you, if so then apologies my friend.” <EOS>
<BOS> You give Vera an embrace and a kiss, which she returns. <EOS>
<BOS> “Madeline. (Sigh) Look. You’re experiencing a phase. You don’t seriously want any sort of long term relationship with someone like me. I mean if you think I’m any better than Camid, you’re only thinking that because I find you useful in a capacity that doesn’t involve sex. I’m NOT a nice guy. Just ask anyone. Hell, talk with Zalmora. She’ll be the first one to tell you all my shortcomings.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> He might be bullshitting you, but you’re not exactly familiar with this area, so you might as well not take chances. Still, you got a better idea on payment. <EOS>
<BOS> “Either way, he sure killed a lot of people. Fucking hell…” a third says. <EOS>
<BOS> First thing she does is address Heather and her people and going on about how she is thankful for their help. Heather is doing her best to look cordial, but it’s obvious that she barely even wants to be here anymore. Doesn’t help when Ludmilla mentions Heather’s obvious aging through magic use and mentions that she made sure to use her own magic sparingly so as not to over exert herself. <EOS>
<BOS> No point in taking chances... <EOS>
<BOS> “Um. No, they probably didn’t. First off, nobody but Garrick would dare enter my quarters in the first place. Second, I made sure to hide it from immediate sight after the deed was done.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well cuz, I can lead you to it. Lotz o’ paths in this forest lead lotz o’ places. Easy to get lost if you don’t know da way.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Looks like some of the EC are begging to be declawed. I’m always up for whittling down their ranks.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> The dark figure, the shaman, Lorthander, releases you from suspension in the air. Your feet hit the ground with relief. <EOS>
<BOS> As the rest of your cohorts run around desperately trying to get out of this death trap, you do the only thing you want to do and that’s plunge your sword into Madeline. She puts up no resistance and just touches your face before falling to the ground. <EOS>
<BOS> “Anyway, you’re probably looking at twenty years kid. One for each vial. The kingdom has been really cracking down lately on it. Probably get sent to Dreadcage too. They send all the serious offenders there.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You.” She says in a voice slightly deeper than you remember. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh of course she doesn’t. That’s all part of her act. The puritanical demon seductress. Gets everyone hot an bothered and keeps them on a string by not actually putting out. How better to control the average man? I’ll tell you what, we could use someone like her in the EC. Would make things easier to a certain extent.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yinen? What the hell happened to you?” you say remarking about several things applying to him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What? Nah, you’re fucking with me.” <EOS>
<BOS> From behind your ranks, Lorthander weaves his psionic magic, causing turmoil and fear within the Empire soldiers. You signal your officers to charge forward, each one a member of the company. It’s taken years, but more have rallied to your side. The members of the company each lead a battalion, all under your ultimate command. Your military force grows along with support from the people. A child of tragedy growing up to oppose the same Empire that massacred his peaceful adoptive family? The people ate it up. It’s the type story that would be etched into history, especially if victory was achieved. <EOS>
<BOS> Doesn't take long before a few of the mermaids closest to your side of the boat grab you and pull. This action combined with the mermaids on the other side pushing the boat, you fall overboard into the water. <EOS>
<BOS> “Our growth in the past few years allows us to,” Seth answers, both hands placed firmly on the table in front of him. He adds on, pointing to the map. “I’ll lead the prime army into Urchin’s Hook, posing as a direct attack on the capital. The Empire will have to send a sizable number to meet us or they will risk surrendering the capital, a defeat even the Empire cannot recover from.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you exit the inn, you’re shoved into the back of a cart. Another older man with many scares on his face in iron shackles sits in the cart. He gives you a brief look and then returns to looking back at the cart floor. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, dere’s some rumors about him and not just about him pokin’ the Baron’s son like a woman. Like he’s got magic powers or sumthin’. Guess makes sense he don’t need extra help.” <EOS>
<BOS> You then feel a body drop on your chest and putting all the weight behind it. You cough and try to catch your breath and that’s when you finally see what is attacking you. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m fine Gwen, see to our friend though, maybe he’s hurt, I saw him take a magic bolt to the chest.” Heather remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re dragging Lloyd’s carcass away all you can do is thank Yag that Rook’s paranoia was placed in a direction other than yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> “My, you’re a suspicious one. Though understandable and smart. However, if you give the pair of us time, you will soon see there is no need for animosity.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Not really. I think you were closer to Sneaks than I ever was. That going to be a problem?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, yeah price…hmm, you want to go to Holgard right? Five gold coins.” Warts answers. <EOS>
<BOS> “No. We are NOT capturing and selling fucking kids! THAT is where I’m drawing the damn line. In fact I’m thinking this whole thing is a bad idea.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile you just shake your head at the lot you’ve hooked up with. While you knew this organization had some problems, you thought there was going to be an attempt at restructuring it by Tom. He seems content however on just taking a hands off approach, or at least an approach that doesn’t involve a lot of rules. <EOS>
<BOS> “Exactly! There has never been enough organization to do it right here. We could set up shop and as I said, slaver and pirate ships come here all the time for supplies or rest and he Jicol government doesn’t give a shit as long as they aren’t trying to pillage the place. If we have our own dock, we could easily start selling slaves without even the hassle of potentially getting shit from the Jicol government.” <EOS>
<BOS> “They can’t actually believe they’ll win.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Since you aren’t going for the gun, you attempt to stall for time. <EOS>
<BOS> "Being the boss means you always get to take the credit." You chuckle. <EOS>
<BOS> Nights are hard and cold, days hot and sore. It feels like all you can see is one red blur. Perhaps under other conditions, Crimson Sands would be pretty, or at least interesting, but you have come to loathe the red desert. <EOS>
<BOS> You get a couple hours in before you wake up and can’t go back to sleep. Seeing as you aren’t going to get any more sleep, you pack your stuff and decide to leave your room in the middle of night and just head to the carriage station early. You don’t really know when Elana is going to show up there anyway, so you might not even have to wait that long. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re doing a pretty good job stomping on him, but he isn’t out of the fight yet and manages to grab your foot and cause you to fall to the ground as well. Now seizing his opportunity he rolls over and gets on top of your chest and proceeds to punch you in the face though you’re doing your best in trying to block the attacks. <EOS>
<BOS> Well this is news. You aren’t sure if you should be happy or uneasy that Peter is so freely admitting this. <EOS>
<BOS> It would be much kinder to just kill Vera now and be done with it and perhaps you would under normal circumstance. <EOS>
<BOS> "Dustan?" she whispers, with her own mouth. Her voice sounds raspy, but it is there. <EOS>
<BOS> Most of your hobs are incinerated instantly by the remaining Dornan spells. A lot of the Felians too, before Gloom orders a retreat. He doesn’t make it out though before he’s brought down by some spell that causes him to age rapidly and then fall over dead. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t have time for this. Bitch, you will LET me in there because if you don’t I’m going to do to YOU and the rest of these assholes what I did to these fuckers.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re done. You might still have strong feelings for Tanya, but obviously you’re going to have to get over them and hopefully in time they will eventually dissipate by putting as much space as you can between you and her. You also hope the dreams will come to an end because if they don’t that’s going to make the process a lot harder, if not impossible. <EOS>
<BOS> “The book?” <EOS>
<BOS> "A lofty goal, good luck." You debate how much to say about your own mission. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re doing pretty well until you suddenly hear some noise behind you. At first you think it’s something sinister lurking down here or possibly even Scales himself, but when you hear the word “Shit!” you know the voice immediately and turn around thrusting your lantern ahead. <EOS>
<BOS> Besides the unknown factor of his location, there’s also the unknown factor of what abilities he has or what else is in the house. At best you’re hoping he’s just some mouthpiece for bloodthirsty cult. At worst he’s going to be summoning demons and have all sorts of other dark magic at his disposal. <EOS>
<BOS> You figure it might be best to head somewhere that you can at least get your bearings about what you’re going to do in the long term with your life. Still, it would be best to stay off the road and stick to the wilderness. With a new goal, you head in the direction of Klyton and hoping nobody from Teckleville is tracking you. <EOS>
<BOS> "CABBAGES, PANTIES, IT'S NOT GOT A NOSE, AND I'LL SMASH YOUR FACE!" <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t say any more and just get up to leave. As you’re doing this, you make one last glance back at the stage and there you see Madeline accepting her diploma with a big smile. She has no idea what is in store for her. <EOS>
<BOS> And like most guys your age (Or guys in general) you make your most important decision with your dick. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, sounds like maybe one of our lovely sirens is exactly what you need.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, can’t argue with that. Things in this city have been feeling a little more tense than usual. Rumors are that there are dark forces gathering to stage a coup on the Baron.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I guess. Just wondering why now all of a sudden.” <EOS>
<BOS> You shrug on your cloak, shoulder your pack, grab your favorite carved walking stick from your collection, and shuffle on foot through the trees towards a forked path overlooking the town. Your limited supply of money will not get very far, and you cannot cross mountains, oceans, and deserts on foot. You'll need some form of transportation, and the nearest place to get that is Dreaming Village. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit!” you say and push your underling aside and continue to run towards Nightfall. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah now practically has her legs wrapped around you. Fortunately you’re still in the school of arts area so nobody is really paying much attention since public outdoor fucking isn’t that uncommon around here, what with everyone being a free spirit and all. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I’ve got a job that needs doing and I don’t have time to do it myself and I’d rather not send my assistant there by herself. You familiar with qweepas?” <EOS>
<BOS> You look up and see Tanya on the second floor throwing a rope to you over the railing. You waste no time in grabbing and climbing up it while she pulls you up. <EOS>
<BOS> "Stop!" you beg, kneeling with your hands on your head, trying to push every call away from you. Even your connection with Ivani, you dampen, until all that is left is a sort of floating feeling. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, okay, I’ll shut up.” Tom remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Honestly I had hoped you had a better idea than just simply trying to wear them down.” Shade remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Your screams are brief before its claws tear through your soft skin and its teeth rip out your tasty organs. <EOS>
<BOS> “Who is leading them anyway? I mean we’ve only got a few rumors and names.” <EOS>
<BOS> Mr. Reynolds listens intently and smiles. <EOS>
<BOS> “STOP! STOP! What the hell did I do?!” you utter. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera’s been pretty understanding through all this so that’s certainly helping, but you’re wondering if maybe it would help even more if you weren’t in Holgard any longer. <EOS>
<BOS> Without another word, the woman kisses you and shoves her tongue in your mouth. You manage to briefly stop the grinding of your bodies long enough and pull your lips apart to speak. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, you’re finally awake I was hoping you would soon.” <EOS>
<BOS> As you ponder your life choices you glance at the other man in the cart who doesn’t say anything to you. In fact he doesn’t even really look at you. Upon a few more glances at him, you notice he has a tattoo of a black claw on his shoulder. You wonder if this man is a member of the Ebony Claw Syndicate. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yep, she is and still as limber too. I’m very lucky man, but enough about her, let’s talk about business. Sit.” You say not even blinking an eye. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m attracted to the likes of you, are you really all that surprised that I’m a little fucked up?” <EOS>
<BOS> “So…what? You just going to go in there and tell Tom what he needs to do?” Zalmora asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah, not the complete uncouth rogue I’ve heard our mutual Felian acquaintances tell me about I see. Good.” <EOS>
<BOS> “My husband, Rodsen. Everyone called him ‘Big Red,’ because of his hair.” She swallows. “He’s up north, fighting for the mages against the Delt Incursion. Or he was.” The lady twists the handkerchief, breaking the delicate threads. “They say he deserted, ran off during breakfast hour. And what if he did! They put him on the front lines, where he was sure to be killed. Or worse, locked forever in a dark cell too small for humans, a cruel fate no one should face. They say he’s a coward.” Mrs. Corellis hangs her head. “But I’d like to think he’s like your bird. He did his duty – moreso, as they had no right on his life to begin with. And if he is dead, then he died free!” <EOS>
<BOS> You make your way out of Klyton wondering where to travel. Holgard comes to mind, but there's always some sort of rebellion or power struggle going on there. You'd rather not have to deal with being in the middle of that mess. The Delantium Kingdom is at war with some other nation, so you'd rather avoid the possibility of suddenly getting press ganged or conscripted into military service. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wow. Don’t mince words do you?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t play dumb with me, I know you still got a thing for Tanya after I told you to just walk away. I remember when we all had to work on that job together three months ago, I swear at one point with how hard you were starin’ at her, I thought you were going to whip your dick out and start wackin’ it right there.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, we’re on the same side aren’t we? However, I do think YOU should get some rest before we attempt this. So you head back to Hells Own, get some sleep and tomorrow night, you and I will meet up outside here. In the meantime, I’m going to talk to Sneaks and few others to see if I can’t get them to make a bit of extra distraction for Neroth’s most loyal. I’m not going to let too many in on this plan though for obvious reasons.” Tanya remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “You could tell just by looking at me?” <EOS>
<BOS> “No! This ain’t about pussy bumpin! Its just…(sigh) nevermind you’ll just make fun and if you don’t I know damn well this ugly half breed will.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Just stop. As I said, it hardly matters now. (Sigh) The next question, is where does this all leave us? I mean seeing as you’re a half spy for the Syndicate and I just murdered the leader of the Guild, it’s not like either of us can go back.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I told you, I haven’t seen him in days. He probably left the city.” Bruno says. <EOS>
<BOS> You twist from his grasp, but don’t attack just yet. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera’s made her point clear and quite frankly you don’t really think its worth it to convince her if she’s got that much bad feelings toward you. You’d be better off starting from scratch. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s still too early for me to start looking like an ogre after feeding time at the halfling trough, but I have been feeling nauseous and peeing a lot more. Also my tits feel tender sometimes.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Is this the part where you tell me why exactly you decided to be a traitorous piece of shit? Because if it is, then hurry up.” <EOS>
<BOS> You then step on his wrist and take the knife from him. <EOS>
<BOS> “I think most people will be wearing those so, you’ll fit in fine. I got one too.” Vera says and puts on her her mask and the pair of you are soon on your way. <EOS>
<BOS> You slowly get up and rip your own mask off your face and look around for your clothes. While you’re getting dressed you start feeling a sight ache all over your body. You feel drained in fact, almost reminds you of how you used to feel with your sessions with Tanya. <EOS>
<BOS> “My king, I have a realistic understanding of my skillset. I could hardly stop Seth on a bad day, let alone an entire group of men.” <EOS>
<BOS> As for you, the only concerns you’ve been having, as of late is the Ebony Claw Syndicate and to a lesser extent, the Jicol government. <EOS>
<BOS> “My problem is we could have had a real professional do this and probably be done by now. This little school bitch doesn’t know what the fuck is doing and we got goblins running around being the obnoxious little green shits they always are.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh come on now. You trying one last try at lowering the price? I told you I wasn’t here to haggle. You know it was a thousand gold pieces.” <EOS>
<BOS> "If you're married, it might not be as suspicious if you're just handing over bags of money for this property." Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the fuck Warts. You’re just gonna abandon everything?” <EOS>
<BOS> Well there’s another bit of information you can add to your mental notes. <EOS>
<BOS> You leave the Welcome Mat and go get yourself some food and then spend the rest of the day seeking out new burglary opportunities. Normally you would have spent the rest of the day doing the whole distract and con jobs with Annah, but without her around now, you’re content on focusing no longer having to directly deal with people. <EOS>
<BOS> Later <EOS>
<BOS> In any case when Vera hears about what you’ve allowed she doesn’t do much but shake her head. <EOS>
<BOS> You regroup with the rest of the company. Lorthander heals each man who sustained injury in the mental attack. They have the same mindset as you; the Empire must be stopped by any means necessary. For the first time in the war, the tide is turning in your favor. With the power of the Unbroken, you will topple an empire. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Tom stands up. <EOS>
<BOS> Not to mention, he’s the one that sucks, why should you leave? <EOS>
<BOS> Several other townsfolk go running off shouting about your deeds, and a few others look as if they’re going to take their chances apprehending you themselves and while Wilfred is a fat out of shape barkeep, you don’t know if you’d do as well against the blacksmith who is now approaching you with a hammer in hand. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmmm, and that’s it?” <EOS>
<BOS> Once you get that down, then maybe you can figure out a way to get back to your own time. <EOS>
<BOS> “It was okay.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Marco! This may surprise you, but I am actually glad to see you’re alive.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> While you couldn’t have known that the other prisoner in the cart was an Ebony Claw enforcer, the sergeant certainly did, but by the time he and his people get him off of you, the man has managed to head-butt you in the face, breaking your nose followed by ripping your throat out with just his teeth. <EOS>
<BOS> As for the other faiths, only the temples of Dorna and Fel maintain any presence in the city and in the Felians case, that’s thanks to Shade dying soon after the war was over and the new leader Gloom, making an effort to strengthen their relationship with the upper echelons of the government, namely Baroness Ludmilla. <EOS>
<BOS> You ignore the pain in your chest as you desperately attempt to not fall off the side of the roof. The top half of your body hangs over the edge as you struggle to move from your precarious position. You manage to sit up just in time to see the wizard throwing another magic bolt your way. <EOS>
<BOS> "Row! Row! Row northward and don't do anything else! Don't look at anything except down at the floor of this boat!" Rifiv shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> Somehow though, it’s much different. With Tanya, she was always still dominant in some way. With this woman, it’s…well hard to describe. <EOS>
<BOS> He goes on to say that normally he wouldn’t bother to travel to the doomed city, but sometimes an in person presence is required to appease certain clients. <EOS>
<BOS> “I was. Wasn’t like she took care of me, she tossed me aside as soon as I was born and I suppose I was lucky to be born female and she wasn’t hungry at the time. Look, while I’m sure this is all very intriguing for you, I am fucking done talking about this. If you want to know what happened to me, I don’t fucking know! Maybe all the demonic ties that Reginald and by proxy his home had to the infernal realm had some effect and I lost control because I’ve let my guard down to it over the years. I guess I was lucky that you punched me in the face to snap me out of it. Thanks, but just because you know some shit about me doesn’t mean we’re getting closer!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey! Over here!” you hear Annah say from an alleyway. You stop and go over to her. <EOS>
<BOS> “That can be done? Wait, do I have to have sex with some girl in a circle while you perform the ritual to summon Tanya?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Great, I was hoping for some enlightenment on this situation.” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey! Leave her be.” Garrick orders. <EOS>
<BOS> Besides your distaste for slavery, Warts’ plan sounds a lot simpler to implement and you figure Vera won’t be occasionally trying flirt with you for favors (or whatever) if you side with him and hence removing temptation. <EOS>
<BOS> "All right," he leans back, "I'm listening now." <EOS>
<BOS> “The Lighthouse?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Wait, so do the siblings actually even own this place?" Zalmora asks. <EOS>
<BOS> This remark causes Rook to give you a stare that could burn a hole through you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why worship any god at all?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I’m afraid I come from a small town and don’t have a good eye for that sort of thing. The merchant passing through was very convincing when he was selling them. I bought them for a girl I liked, but alas, I was unlucky in love too, so I just kept them.” <EOS>
<BOS> As it turns out, not much. He states that he thought inward reflection might help them find greater meaning of Fel’s plan, which in turn made him realize that without allies the Temple is doomed to die a slow lingering death. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh shit!” <EOS>
<BOS> “I heard the sergeant talking with one of his men about it earlier.” <EOS>
<BOS> Keira chuckles a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> Axel's horses won the second event, a test of strength, as they were toned and fit. Rom's horses came in third - and made everyone laugh by prancing as they hauled the wood. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait. You’re telling me that you were planning on going to meet with this Peter without me?” <EOS>
<BOS> “No. Why would I? I’ve never fancied anyone before and I’ve been fighting my succubus heritage remember? That means no sex of any kind. Hell, up until that incident with the cultists, I hadn’t even kissed anyone before.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah boss.” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s not a glorious or noble death falling off a collapsing walkway and into a large hole, but that’s exactly what has happened to you. <EOS>
<BOS> You finally see her face due to being so close to her now. She’s quite pretty. Unnaturally alluring might be a more accurate word, but obviously she isn’t entirely human. Besides her hair being pure white, her eyes now give away an otherworldly appearance and right now her eyes are glowing a reddish color and look like they could twist mithril with the stare they’re giving you. <EOS>
<BOS> The innkeeper calls to the older woman (probably his wife) to go get the special wine from the cellar and then begins exchanging pleasantries with Flynt and his men. He seems to have forgotten about you entirely, though this Flynt seems to be looking over in your direction a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> This brings you back to pondering if you should still send an agent to the Delantium magic university. Chances are, if they’re interested they’re going to just ask you to do what the robes in Klyton want you to do. Namely go there yourself and that’s probably even going to be even more dangerous than just sending an agent there. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ve asked myself the same question multiple times as I’m sure you have. I mean I’m sure some of it is infernal influence, since I was just about to leave and now here I am completely re-considering. However, I think this is the important difference. I NEED to know if you really feel the same way. If don’t, even to the smallest degree, then I’ll know that I should leave. It won’t be easy, but I’ll deal with it. If I was completely under your spell, I don’t think I’d even have the capacity to even think about leaving.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Will try to rape you. Yes, I know. You’ve only mentioned that three or four times already. What is your preoccupation with getting raped?” <EOS>
<BOS> You answer the door and she’s as scuzzy as ever. You feel like you’re catching something just by standing this close to her. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, if you don't go see her now, you'll have to hear even more shit later. So you better see her now. Good thing she's still your wife, because you'd hate to take this sort of aggravation from someone you weren't fucking on a regular basis. <EOS>
<BOS> “This is Lloyd?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> "No," the sailor laughs, "he's the cure." <EOS>
<BOS> “Clueless idiot. Vera’s been in cahoots with the Syndicate for a long time now. In fact that’s what this is really about anyway. I’m turning your ass in to the Syndicate for a shitload of coin.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Well you really should, there's a Klyton Council election coming up in a few years and I'm thinking about running. I'll need all the votes I can get." <EOS>
<BOS> “Slave trade.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya moves closer to you and runs her fingers through your hair and then lifts your head up with one hand and puts another hand to her lips in a “shhhhh” motion. It’s apparent she’s toying with you like a cat would with a mouse, but something about it is very alluring. So much so that you almost forget to punch her right in the face. <EOS>
<BOS> You and your sister sit down in your living area and prepare to catch up. <EOS>
<BOS> Warts doesn’t really know the whole story to that of course, and you don’t really have time to go into it right now, but despite all that, Warts does raise some good points. <EOS>
<BOS> “But she’s out hunting.” <EOS>
<BOS> Mordecai escorts you to the throne room, where King Aeric sits, looking quite unamused. His look towards you is sobering, the same could be said for his bodily condition, something you aren’t used to seeing. His fist slams down on the throne’s arm rest. <EOS>
<BOS> You are not him. Bring him to me. <EOS>
<BOS> And with those last words, Garrick and his associate get up and make their exit, leaving you to ponder your next decision. Which of course is to go spend your new wealth. <EOS>
<BOS> If only your parents could see you now, they probably wouldn't believe it. You don't think your sister would either. Your thoughts sometimes still wander towards them and wonder how they all are at times. <EOS>
<BOS> Your head starts to feel odd and you begin to hear faint little song. You can't even make it out, it's just an ongoing tone seeping into your skull... <EOS>
<BOS> “It is still there from time to time. Yes.” <EOS>
<BOS> The twisting in your stomach isn't just from the rocking boat. Something bad is happening on this ship. But what can you do, in your position? Perhaps keeping a low profile would be a better plan than jumping in to try and help. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey where are you going deep thinker? Aren’t you going to celebrate our successful job?” <EOS>
<BOS> Needless to say, you don’t until you (and her) are completely spent. <EOS>
<BOS> You aren't entirely sure you'll want to return home, but it's good to know - this has been perhaps the most pleasant two weeks of your long journey. <EOS>
<BOS> “An orc? This close to the village?! Shit. We need to tell the magistrate about that! Not that I really want soldiers stomping about here, but if orcs are going to be a problem then I’d rather we have better defenses then we have!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes if enough time passes, but that’s why you try to sell as quickly as possible. Obviously women typically sell for a lot more than men and they sell faster.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No. Probably not.” She says and then kisses you one last time. <EOS>
<BOS> You suddenly get a horrible thought. <EOS>
<BOS> “Stop it! Stop it right now! And stop looking at me like that, if you want to keep your eyesight! I don’t want to hear anymore of your honeyed words! We part ways here and don’t you dare try to follow me!” Tanya yells and pulls her hood even more over her head, before leaping to the next building. <EOS>
<BOS> "Erm, actually all those things are legal in Klyton." Vaughn interrupts. <EOS>
<BOS> One thing that she mentions that you didn’t expect is her recommendation for labor. <EOS>
<BOS> “So you want me to gather plants for you?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Goodbye, my love," you cry as you crash the staff down upon her. Her husk disintegrates into a deep green dust. A painless end. Will she forgive you from her place in the eternal court of the One God? <EOS>
<BOS> Heather nods and you finally put this whole odd meeting behind you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey! It’s me Gwen! Remember me? I healed you up during the invasion! Do you need healing again?!” Gwen beams. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh one more thing, I want that asshole Sneaks alive. I got unfinished business with him.” Rook says tapping his eyepatch. <EOS>
<BOS> “A whore that doesn’t know what the hell she’s doing with her life, but she’s still my cousin and she should finally get a little justice. This city already has more than enough gods competing, and as a dedicated disciple to Fel, I see no reason why I shouldn’t aid directly in their fall. Consider the Holgard Watch taken care of by tomorrow.” <EOS>
<BOS> Tom’s room in this dump isn’t quite as bad as the rest of the place. It even looks like he’s taken great pains to make it look “neat.” After looking through his drawers and small chest, he breathes a sigh of relief. <EOS>
<BOS> “…shit…” is all you can utter as you hit the stone and slump to the floor. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hold on there! Just because you join doesn’t mean you get to go to the main base of operations. If every new recruit got to go there after they joined, the ECS probably would have discovered its location by capturing and torturing one of them. There’s also a process of weeding out potential spies. Certainly hope you didn’t run off and join the ECS and then hope to get in good with them by doing that.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well…” <EOS>
<BOS> The wax doesn't quite drown out the song completely, but it's helping enough that you at least don't feel like you're falling under some sort of enchantment now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fine, here.” You say dropping a few more coins in his overfilled hands which fall to the floor. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, Garrick I fucking know. You brought me in off the streets when I was some poor dirty orphan stealing food and had run away from the home for the umpteenth time! How long are you going to bring that up? I’ve never said I wasn’t appreciative, I think my time staying here has proven that, but if you think I OWE you something more, then you’ve been a fool for a longer time than even he has! Worse even.” <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re thinking about that, a man dressed in a dark hooded cloak nearly sneaks up on you and you’re just quick enough to pull your pistol out on him before he reaches your table. <EOS>
<BOS> “So, we meet again nocturnal one. Glad to see even our criminal element has a sliver of patriotism in them to defend this great city as opposed to just taking advantage of the chaos.” Ludmilla remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> It was suggested a few times in the past that the League should just try to take over Jicol, but honestly it’s not like that would have been really feasible or cost effective to even attempt. However, it’s starting to look like you might have to do something though. <EOS>
<BOS> “I mean if she wants to leave the village why not go with her? You’re both hunters no? Surely between the pair of you, you would have no trouble in the foraging for food and water aspect or even overcoming dangers.” <EOS>
<BOS> “If they did, it wasn’t directly. Their representative just left and we haven’t heard anything from them since. Despite never seeing any signs of the Claw again, Edmond got even more paranoid than he already was. Started organizing riskier jobs and accepting anyone who was desperate enough to join. He was convinced we were going to have to deal with the Claw again so we needed to be prepared. All that ultimately happened was with all the new unskilled people we got sloppier and caused even more heat to bear down on us and well, this is what we’re reduced to today.” <EOS>
<BOS> The night of the attack comes and you lie in wait from a distance with your people. You soon hear the scuffles and shouts of battle. Unlike the faithful of Fel, the faithful of Joachim aren’t exactly the most quiet when they fight. <EOS>
<BOS> “How do you know that I’m not doing the same thing?” <EOS>
<BOS> You release the choke and allow Kassi to sit up, or at least you allow her to. She lies on the mat unmoving. <EOS>
<BOS> Reginald isn’t exactly in the best position to give any orders however as he’s in an even worse position than you since he’s now buried under two bodies rather than just yours. He struggles to get his arms free and while you’re trying to do the same you get another idea. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well glad to see you’re staying grounded. Where is Kol?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes sir." Rob replies without emotion. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not just this city. This…world. I’m feeling very drawn to my roots as it were. Never thought I’d be longing to go to such an awful place, but I feel I must, if only to learn more about myself.” <EOS>
<BOS> Warts shrugs and waves the two hobs standing nearby to come with him leaving you and Dusk alone. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, winter!” <EOS>
<BOS> “You little bastard! You see that? He tried to kill me too! Someone get the town watch! Someone go get Klint’s family too, they need to know what this murderer did to their boy!” Wilfred shouts as he clutches his bleeding arm. <EOS>
<BOS> When you arrive, you’re greeted warmly since it’s been a long time since you’ve been to it and not just because you own the place. <EOS>
<BOS> “No! No! Fuck you, I’m not tellin’ you shit now. (hic) Who…who…what do you think I am some kinda asshole fer you to abuse? Callin’ me seventy fuckin’ years old. I oughta kick yer ass in the name of Joachim! Yer lucky I’m a man of faith…(hic)” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wouldn’t be here if I didn’t.” Dusk says. <EOS>
<BOS> Placing the chair nearby, you sit down and make a mental note about never working a real job ever again. The kicker is, you still have a bunch of over grown rats to acquire. Still, you agreed to this so you continue to make the effort and sit outside like a loser. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh?” <EOS>
<BOS> A week passes and sure enough while you’re waiting at the Bloody Bandit, Percy comes walking in. He’s as upbeat as he was the last time you met with him. He sits down and immediately orders a drink. <EOS>
<BOS> "Okay, I know that look. Out with it." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Tom proceeds to tell you where he thinks Scales makes his home. It actually isn’t too far from the forgotten sewer entrance. Tom goes on to say it might be dangerous just getting to Scales, since that part of the sewers has been non-functional and abandoned for as long as he can remember. <EOS>
<BOS> "I know you keep denying and I'd really like to take your word. However, she's already told me about some very intimate things about your body and I think I'd know if she was lying or not." <EOS>
<BOS> You pull a thin scarf from your pack and wrap it around your mouth like a bandana, hoping to keep the worst of the dirt out. But it seems even more is getting in. The wind is picking up, and dust stings your eyes. Dark clouds rise from the ground in the northwest. An ash-storm? <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, if you’re not going to by any special titles, can I at least add one to myself? I mean I am your sister. I mean I’m actually royalty now and I didn’t even have to marry someone to do it!” Your sister says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Heather! What the hell are you doing?!” one yells <EOS>
<BOS> “You always did know how to make me laugh despite my best efforts not to.” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Maybe later when things here at the inn die down a bit. Too much to do right now." <EOS>
<BOS> Year 28 <EOS>
<BOS> She wears a half mask similar to the one you’re wearing and her long hair is freely flowing behind her and partially on her shoulders. It’s not white, but it’s blonde enough to vaguely remind you of Tanya. (Though at this point she’s dominating your thoughts) <EOS>
<BOS> You turn to run back the other way, and thanks to a few of the militia being overly enthusiastic about their job, you get a poleaxe to your back and then trampled on by several heavy boots when you fall to the floor. This results in severe head trauma which doesn’t kill you immediately, but you do go unconscious. A coma in fact. <EOS>
<BOS> Then again, it’s not cheating at all is it? Tanya isn’t in the picture anymore and hasn’t been for years and Vera gave you permission. <EOS>
<BOS> Besides the Bloody Talons potentially giving you grief, they’ve also been terrorizing the city with their actions, which means the Klyton Militia has been cracking down harder on everything. <EOS>
<BOS> “Bullshit. Maybe at one time she did. Not anymore. You’re not so stupid to not realize that. Hell, she tried to speak up for you just now. I don’t know HOW you did it, but you’ve actually been getting through that normally solid brick wall she puts up to shield herself again all would be suitors. I have seen MANY try and while I imagine that she leaves a lasting impression due to her nature, I have seen NONE continue to pursue her, or those that have, have met with physical violence that either put a definite stop to it. Somehow you have miraculously avoided that. Somehow YOU have defied what shouldn’t be possible.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You aren’t cursed. I detect no curses on you. Infernal or otherwise.” <EOS>
<BOS> Well Zalmora was correct last time with her advice, and you have been on a roll with the whole talking thing lately. Jake would probably jump at the chance to split off from the gang at this point and make his own way. <EOS>
<BOS> She tells you that her father killed and collected your soul. She says he doesn’t do that often because it requires a lot of energy for him to do so mainly because he’s not a full blood demon, but he felt this was an important occasion. <EOS>
<BOS> You think for a moment of who Tanya could even be talking about. At first you think it might be Naji, but you only had sex with her before Tanya left. Then you remember. <EOS>
<BOS> "State your business!" a brusque voice says, and you realize you are surrounded by mages. Did Forgill sell you out? <EOS>
<BOS> "You know on my end, this could be settled really easily." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I knew I shouldn’t have pointed that out. I do want to stress though I never actually betrayed the Guild though, I always wanted to tell you because I felt it was the honest thing to do. I just never could figure out a good way to do it and then for awhile you wanted me to leave you alone and…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t see why I should give you time at all.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh just one of my contacts for information sir. I can give you a full report of what’s been going on here after you’ve completed your business with the wizards if you like.” <EOS>
<BOS> You and Vera talk a bit more about less important matters before you eventually part ways due to having business to take care of. You see Vera one more time before she leaves where upon she says that she tells you to be careful and hugs you goodbye. <EOS>
<BOS> How the hell did it come to this? If you wanted to be mundane, you might as well have stayed in Teckleville and followed in your dad’s footsteps. Maybe he was right after all. <EOS>
<BOS> Finally you get to when you finally parted ways with Tanya, along with what you soon discovered whenever you were intimate with another girl. Vera now looks very stunned. <EOS>
<BOS> You pry and pry, but don’t seem to be making any headway. You begin to think that the daggers are being held in place by magic and you might be right considering that you suddenly feel a force knock the prybar from your hand and as you try to grab it you stumble into one of the isolated stands with a glass case knocking it over and falling on the broken glass. <EOS>
<BOS> You help Warts with the sewer covering and the pair of you descend into the smelly depths. <EOS>
<BOS> “What about his magical powers?” <EOS>
<BOS> “The command of your father. He was very strict about not gathering kingdom civilians, but war refugees? That’s another matter,” Lorthander answers. “My prince, I do not like it. I wish I could stop it, but I’m faithful to the throne. I hope things will be different when you’re king...if Osborne ever dies.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I can’t! You put a curse on me that prevents me from having sex with any other woman! Anytime I do, they wind up dead a few days later!” you answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “I wanted ta catch ya before I left. I noze I still owez youz a debt, well I’m here ta repay.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I would also like to be in the firestrike,” Horne says, the cloak covering his lower face muffles his voice. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya, WE need to talk. There’s something going on between us and I have to think you know what I mean. This has been a long time coming and I can’t just continue to walk around here in silence any longer.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. Well haven’t seen you in here before. What brings the head of the Nocturnal League to my humble shop?” <EOS>
<BOS> The first time, it takes awhile for you to get into it mainly because now you feel like you’re not just cheating on Tanya, but that you’re also cheating on Vera! <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t know what to say. There isn’t anything you can say. She’s right and it sucks. <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, you’ve been more or less making a decent living here and despite a healthy amount of paranoia, you actually like it here. It’s definitely not Teckleville. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, fine. Maybe we need to do something. The question is what exactly? I’m still loathe to go all out gang war on a bunch of fanatics, because you know they’re only going to hit back with more fervor…maybe…wait a minute. We could set it up so it looks like the Ebony Claw is targeting them. That will hopefully draw some heat off of us on both sides.” Garrick says. <EOS>
<BOS> "So soon?" you gasp, "that's impossible." <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, so you and this Jenny…” <EOS>
<BOS> Warts coughs a bit and looks away. You hear a sniffle. <EOS>
<BOS> “You fuckers think you can take over? You assholes can’t even get along with each other! And you, I actually liked you kid, but I can see that I was severely wrong on that front. Y’know if you weren’t happy here, you could have just left. I’ve never held anyone here against their will. But no you had to try this shit, well that ain’t happening and now you have to pay. I’m the fucking boss around here and you’re the example.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I thought you said we weren’t getting into slaves.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Also knowing I don’t have choice in the matter either.” <EOS>
<BOS> "That idiot!" she snaps, then sighs. "He did make excellent perfumes, however. Continue." <EOS>
<BOS> You look at the orb for a moment as if you’re going to see something other than utter blackness before putting it away. <EOS>
<BOS> You shade your eyes with your hands and peer out, looking for any sort of shelter. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s been long enough. We should start on the offensive!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, Indeed. You keep interesting allies. Also explains how you’ve survived so long. In any case, about this time a plain old assassination attempt was planned, but then that ongoing failure Peter Varsakken was slowly starting to gather enough forces to invade Holgard. In the past ECS had problems with him doing this, but at that time? Not so much, and it was looking like maybe an agreement could be reached. Peter was just happy we wouldn’t be sabotaging him this time.” <EOS>
<BOS> If you didn’t like Gertrude acting as a “babysitter” on occasion before, the way she’s speaking doesn’t make you like her any better. You immediately start to move towards her. Meanwhile Gertrude immediately puts her hands up and backs away. <EOS>
<BOS> Odd that Carl or Annie never spoke of him at all, but perhaps they were too scared of him to even say his name and it's easy to see why. <EOS>
<BOS> “Even me?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well you could take over.” <EOS>
<BOS> “The Governor of Hessla is going to hear about this Zamed! There are certain laws in place for a reason!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I’ll give you a little more time because you seem to believe that yours is true love. If you do manage to convince the demonkin to join though, well that will just prove I was right in seeing your potential. However, I can’t walk away from this meeting without nothing, so I still need you to do something for me or at least provide some sort of information.” Rook responds. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, then would it make a difference if ALL the slaves were just being used to go get worked to death in some iron mine?” <EOS>
<BOS> You walk down a street catching a lot of glances. Most of the inhabitants of this city are human (Though you’re seeing a couple of races that you’ve never even seen before) so you’re not standing out so much on that aspect, but the way you’re dressed is definitely cause for intrigue. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hi, friend.” The older one says. <EOS>
<BOS> You look at their faces. Some of them laugh nervously, others bury their heads in their cups, and still others are genuinely more interested in the food. But two people meet your gaze: a stiff man bearing the crest of a minor mage, thin faced and tight lipped; and the little girl in her wooden chair, her eyes shining bright as she eagerly raises a hand. He would have deeper pockets, and likely represent the sentiments of the adults more accurately, but she looks genuinely interested in hearing a good story. <EOS>
<BOS> And somewhere even now you see a spark of what Tanya once was. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, fucking thorns. Ouch!” you hear her say and you come out of hiding. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, maybe you’d be okay after a couple ales.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t kill my…” you start to say before the one of the guards starts actually paying attention to you. <EOS>
<BOS> Once again Zal is right on that part. You don't even know why you said such an empty threat. Perhaps a last minute act of a desperate man still not sure of what he wants in the future. <EOS>
<BOS> “What is it?” <EOS>
<BOS> "When we get to Scaleport in Redsand, yes. That will be another four days." <EOS>
<BOS> Lately you’ve been starting to wonder if you shouldn’t just do what your sister did and leave. It’s just getting to be too much hassle to steal in this town and it definitely isn’t as much fun as it used to be. <EOS>
<BOS> "Not since she was a child," one whispers, "when the Emperor called one in. But it was a patronizing little tale about obedience, she hated it. Asked for the woman to be fed to her pet tiger, bit by bit. The emperor obliged, and some say that was what triggered her thirst for blood. We are all hoping your story does well." <EOS>
<BOS> “I told you making our home in a fucking Fel temple wasn’t going to be a good idea.” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> This response is met with a lot of derision. <EOS>
<BOS> “Halt, you don’t look like a merchant or anyone else that has a real job. In fact you look a bit suspicious sneaking about the city at this time of night.” One of the guards says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait. We were behind Derrick’s barn during that?” <EOS>
<BOS> This is the second time this week that you’ve been accused of a serious crime and once again you didn’t even mean to do it! <EOS>
<BOS> The sewers are good enough for you. If you start trying to set up shop up top, you're just going to bring down the heat eventually. <EOS>
<BOS> “And I see even with being in charge of an island you’re still dressing like you just got out of bed.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, I’m sorry.” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> You slightly raise your arms a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um…yeah my grandparents, though my dad also worked there.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Visiting your sister? Was she a whore here?” the man laughs along with his fellows. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well as long as you do right? So if she’s a Countess, does that mean you’re…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad to be rid of that thing.” He says. <EOS>
<BOS> Out of respect, Warts insists that you be properly buried rather than eaten. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sounds good, so what’s the catch?” <EOS>
<BOS> The man’s eyes widen a bit when you mention Mr. Scars, but nods. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t know. I mean I’m not an expert on the whole will of the gods thing. I imagine it probably is playing a part. When Oscar was born my mom went into labor right in front of the Fel Temple in Holgard, so I assume maybe something similar is going on here. Maybe infants just catch Fel’s attention, but as I said, I’m no expert. We’d need to contact a priest of Fel to gain further information on all this stuff. In fact, you’re probably going to want to do that anyway since his abilities are probably going to get stronger and he’ll need the guidance. Don’t really know any Fel priests on this island though.” Gertrude says. <EOS>
<BOS> The Zorch Rat meanwhile, jumps up and down to keep your attention. <EOS>
<BOS> “When isn’t she cranky? Tell her I’m here I’m about that thing she was researching for me and I’m here to go through with it. She’ll know what I’m talking about.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You will? Are you sure?” Dr. Gossey asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Is it? Think hard now.” Tanya replies. <EOS>
<BOS> "That's my price. I might be old and not in the best of health, but two thousand isn't going to sustain me until I die. I know a big time crime lord such as yourself probably has that kind of money." <EOS>
<BOS> “Well if it isn’t the notorious thief of Teckville. Shouldn’t you be skulking around in the shadows stealing from little old ladies?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I know you heard me. And I KNOW damn well you still think about it. I’ve know the stories about you requesting that those little brothel whores to try to look like me when you’re at those places.” <EOS>
<BOS> It's all a very long shot anyway and you've already come to the conclusion that you're not going quietly. <EOS>
<BOS> Fortunately you trip up Klint in the process, who instead of taking advantage, continues to stumble in the direction he was already running in. Unfortunately, he crashes right into Annah who was coming out of the store at the time. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sorry Annah.” You say not really knowing how to follow up. <EOS>
<BOS> "Naturally. You certainly aren't one of her guests," a guard laughs. "But let's see what you've brought." <EOS>
<BOS> By evening, the grove is silent once more, the birds fled and the flowers closed. It seems different - less sacred, more mundane. Through the spacious gaps in the canopy, you can see the twilight green darkening into night. 7 colorful bands of dust weave a rainbow through the sky like a promise - a promise that the everyone will go on, even without the Muses to guide them, into a future full of dreams and stories. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, it sucks. Months out at sea, nothing to do. Rationing food and water. And the worst is getting lost. As I said, it was a good thing that merchant ship came when it did, our boat was starting to sink.” <EOS>
<BOS> You set off to the temple of Dorna. Along the way you see several groups of Joachimite fanatics preaching their faith to passersby. Most of the citizens are just trying to go about their day and are meekly just accepting the various pamphlets the Joachimites are aggressively distributing. Your own League members should be so intimidating. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sheesh, dat wuz a long time ago boss. Yer memory iz good if you can member whores. I can’t even member when my weddin’ anniversary is, though I wuz drunk at the time an’ Snuffit reminds me anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s the woman that was with Garrick earlier. You still can’t quite make out her face, it’s as if the hood completely shrouds it in darkness. The white hair still peaks out though. <EOS>
<BOS> “I believe he’s going to meet him after he leaves. In fact he tried to convince me that I should go with him, but I didn’t see much point with the League attempting to ally with Peter for the same reasons I told you.” <EOS>
<BOS> But when you touch her back, it is hard. And she, too, has bits of dappled gray throughout her flesh, giving her a piebald appearance. When the wind briefly snatches her hair away, you see that her eyes are opened, if unfocused, a deep and translucent green like clear twilight. How could you have forgotten such a color? <EOS>
<BOS> "One of those charmed fools just lit a fucking powder keg below deck! This ship is going down! Come on, help me to the emergency rowboat! I saw a patch of land to the north!" Rifiv shouts before he stumbles to the floor of the ship. <EOS>
<BOS> You have some theories about why, but for now you just answer: <EOS>
<BOS> You run towards her and then immediately have to take cover as the sounds of several cannons are fired in Heather’s (and your) direction. <EOS>
<BOS> “Now I don’t think I need to tell you, that I’d like to keep our hideout a secret.” Tom says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Like what?” Vaughn asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Let me guess, Sneaks told you…I’m going to kill him.” <EOS>
<BOS> Heather’s a powerful wizard and can probably take care of herself. Her students on the other hand you’re not so sure of and you’re going to need all the magic help possible if you’re going to turn back this invasion. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wha…shit!” <EOS>
<BOS> After a few hours of just scouting and walking around, it’s much like you figured. A lot of scholarly types with their noses in books and rich kids that do a lot of partying. The dorms have security, but oddly not as much as one might think. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay then, guess I’ll see her back home then.” <EOS>
<BOS> Another mage bursts into the room. "Trouble at the gate -" <EOS>
<BOS> You search for several minutes, passing and re-passing the muses, until finally you find her a bit apart from the others. She looks to be sleeping on a bench, her long hair unbound and toyed with by the breeze, not frozen like stone or wax. <EOS>
<BOS> “Your relationship with a succubus is extremely unusual and while she didn’t curse you, she DID leave a mark on you. Now most of the time when this happens, the victim usually dies after the succubus finally tires of them and kills them personally or in a much rarer case, the victim falls into a deep depression and commits suicide after an extended period time of separation because the succubus has abandoned them.” <EOS>
<BOS> No sooner has one of your people stepped into the front door and they nearly get beheaded by a swinging axe trap. Unfortunately, they still get skewered by the spear trap when they ducked and dodged to the left. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe you’re not thinking rationally and you’re also still holding on to lingering feelings for Tanya, but that doesn’t also stop you from being suspicious of this ritual anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> “I risk my life every time I go out on a job.” <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s not what I heard.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well, you may observe, but do not speak. As for the rest of you, return to your tasks. I will call upon you when needed. Now then you, follow me into my chambers and tell me your tale. Then perhaps we can come to some sort of deal.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Long live the Emperor,” Mira replies with less zeal. She takes a sip from the cup. The flavor bursts on her tongue like a bite into a fresh apple, by far the best drink she’s ever tasted. <EOS>
<BOS> As you spend a few days reading some books (and improve your basic understanding of the Empire’s language in general) your thoughts start to wander a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> You almost expect Annah to hit you again, but now she does something worse...she doesn’t do it often, but… <EOS>
<BOS> You shake your head. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s okay, it’s okay, I’m with the Ebony Claw Syndicate!” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that might be easier to do if we dealt with him now then. In fact I sort of wanted to address that idea.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Looks like I’m not the only one that’s been spying.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Stop! No...YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE!" You hear the captain shout. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because that name was taken by one of the brothels presumably. Anyway, I leave you to it. I probably should start preparing what I’m going to say. Ugh, wish my sister was here, she’d probably be able to write an inspiring speech for me or something.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, here we are.” <EOS>
<BOS> “When the baroness’ men tried to kill me by setting my last church on fire and barricading me inside, they should have known that fire only purifies and will never kill those on the right path or those whose work is not yet done. All that happened in my near death experience was my focus became even clearer with the will of Joachim. I give you the only mercy I can to an infidel. I give you a quick death and may Joachim forgive you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re a fool. A complete and utter fool. You always were.” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> But while that takes care of your immediate future, you have a long-term goal to meet. Mandi is a decent sized town, and while there are not many rich who live there, there are few poor either. Their position on an important bi-weekly trade route has in some sense fostered a casual prosperity. <EOS>
<BOS> And so begins your life with the Crimson Talons... <EOS>
<BOS> “Why? For what purpose?” <EOS>
<BOS> Of course that might be just wishful thinking on your part. <EOS>
<BOS> The threat neutralized, if you could call it that, you immediately check on Seth. His fall wasn’t as graceful as yours. Both of his legs appear broken, judging by the size of the boulder on them. Seth’s eyes are closed, but at least his chest rises and falls with breath. He’s alive, though in bad shape. Your hands grip underneath the boulder and using the strength of your legs, you manage to roll it from Seth’s legs. <EOS>
<BOS> is and not what these cultists are trying to make her. <EOS>
<BOS> Probably due to the shooting, nobody is around of course. You feel like all the strength is leaving your body and lacking any other ideas, you call out Grayhaze’s name in the hopes that maybe she can help you. <EOS>
<BOS> This time you struggle to push yourself up and look up just in time to see Heather fighting off some of the sailors that have managed to get to the docks (or what’s left of them). <EOS>
<BOS> “Duly noted. I’ll be there soon. Just let them know.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wow. Okay then. I’ll leave you be.” <EOS>
<BOS> You feel a sharp pain in your right leg when you try to move it. Doesn’t take long before you realize it’s broken. Your assailant was less lucky and managed to break his neck during the tumble down the stairs. That doesn’t help you that much though since his body is partially holding you down and his buddies are already almost upon you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Heh, I knew you’d be able to do it.” She says and then kisses you on the lips. <EOS>
<BOS> Ironically, the only thing you might have left are your people outside of Holgard unless Ludmilla caught up with them too, but given how many of her people came to wipe you out just now, you have to think she focused her forces on the inside of the city rather than the outside. You imagine Warts might be out there somewhere, it’s just a matter of tracking him down. <EOS>
<BOS> Grabing a hold of the door in a vain attempt to open it and feeling a little hopeless yourself, you say your own prayer though yours is more along the lines of “I sure hope Yag is throwing a seven for me tonight.” <EOS>
<BOS> As they grew up, these twins became the scourge of Teckleville, always getting into mischief. Granted some misbehavior is expected from youth as they find their purpose in life, but it would seem no matter what, these two were bound and determined to pursue the life of crime. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good, glad to hear it. Okay, you can leave now, I should start preparing.” <EOS>
<BOS> “There’s nothing going on with Madeline!” <EOS>
<BOS> Gwen, always the helpful one casts some sort of spell on you that cleans you off, causing Heather to snap. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I guess I could try…we’ll see how it goes when the time comes. But until then, you acting all jittery and anxious is making me feel the same way, so I’d like it if you could take it down a bit…shit what are those?” Annah says pointing ahead. <EOS>
<BOS> Your head starts to feel odd and you begin to hear faint little song. You can't even make it out, it's just an ongoing tone seeping into your skull... <EOS>
<BOS> And there you are standing before Baroness Ludmilla Varsakken. She wears no mask and at this close range you get a good look at her. She almost looks like she could be a vampire what with her skin on the paler side and the black hair accentuating it. She’s beautiful of course, but just looking into her eyes a bit you can see a very ruthless woman before you. You also take a good look at her in general and then glance over at Vera. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yep, Garrick’s been very impressed with you. I’d say a few more jobs and you’ll finally get invited to where all the magic takes place.” Sneaks says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, yeah, I just haven’t used this way in a long time. Gotta pass a haunted cabin. Accidently passed out there once, ended up shitting my good pants, though not sure if that was just because of the ghost.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose you’re right.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I still feel very strongly that we should help the baroness. However I guess you have a point about Peter. It’s not ideal, but I guess we’ll have to split up.” <EOS>
<BOS> There’s also the Thieves’ Guild, which is the ECS chief rival from what you’ve learned. Apparently the Thieves Guild was established here first, but when the ECS moved in with their Blue Dream trade, they’ve been slowly winning the fight over the underworld <EOS>
<BOS> She then says right after she graduated her mother approached her and how strange that event was. The funnier thing she said though is she didn’t completely disbelieve her mother’s story when she heard it as she always felt like there was something more to her life. <EOS>
<BOS> And after all this, you’re still my first love and probably my only because I can’t trust anyone ever again. This is what you’ve done to me. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well…I ain’t no rat, so that wasn’t ever a possibility anyway.” You say in an attempt to at least make Mr. Scars less likely to be suspicious of you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Impertinent whelp!” Kragan bristles – but then immediately relaxes. The old butler looks up a moment in surprise, but then goes back to his work, while the beautiful woman doesn’t even appear to notice his sudden outburst. <EOS>
<BOS> “So…is this all what I should propose to Tom?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, they can stay. If the demon does show up here, maybe they can hurt it a bit before it kills them.” <EOS>
<BOS> “First, Sneaks talks too much and second, well maybe YOU need to start internalizing some of that desire as well. Get control of yourself. It’ll get better and go away over time.” <EOS>
<BOS> As you walk back to the Crimson hideout thinking about the future, you have to admit, it isn’t as bright as you once thought. <EOS>
<BOS> “Take your time, I wasn’t shoving you out the door just yet. I know you didn’t want me to talk, but I felt like I should at least thank you before we parted ways here.” She says. <EOS>
<BOS> A loud sound is heard followed by the sensation of a burning force hitting you hard in the lower chest. Still working on adrenaline you don’t stop and continue to try to wrestle the pistol from Garrick. He fires again, but this time misses as you move his arm and then break his wrist completely causing him to drop it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, you’ve found me, and I hope for your sake, you’ve come to help.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> All things considered you are doing well right now, but there just doesn’t seem to be any let up on the laws being passed to turn this city into a huge prison camp. Part of that you imagine is due to the rebellion in Holgard. You’re certainly glad you didn’t decide to go there given what you heard. <EOS>
<BOS> “I bet he wishes he did.” You mumble and head to your room. <EOS>
<BOS> “Nothing new. Still can’t figure out who is the leader yet. Then again it’s supposed to be a defensive alliance against us, not a proper organization.” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s a big city and you’re ready to take what you can. (And not draw any unwanted attention in the process) <EOS>
<BOS> "Their base is somewhere in this forest," another replied. <EOS>
<BOS> Everything seems to be going fine and then a piece of rock crumbles from the mountainside, sending one of the men screaming to his death below. He desperately reaches out for a hand-hold or someone to catch him. His hand finds your shoulder, pulling you from the rock. After several seconds, your body hits the ground. You don’t feel a thing. <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sniffle) Have you met my mom? She probably doesn’t even know I’m gone yet. Hell, she probably doesn’t even know everything that happened yesterday.” Annah says turning around and wiping her eyes. <EOS>
<BOS> "I - " you wish you could say you don't, but the veiled meaning is uncomfortably clear. Your own life is on the line. "I understand." <EOS>
<BOS> You spend the week at the Cathedral, each night offering blood and receiving a strange life-force in return. You can almost imagine that you look a little younger in the mirror, too. It's a bloody bargain, but they tip you for stories - even if they ask for darker and darker elements. By the end of your stay, you've begun to suspect that the dungeon really has been used on their enemies. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ll be there with a few of my people. Couldn’t hurt.” <EOS>
<BOS> As you're making further preparations for your ambitious plan, Zalmora of course puts her two copper in. <EOS>
<BOS> He glares, "I can take your voice away, again. But it isn't just what is written. Dreams have been gone since the Sacrifice - you know this as does everyone. You may not know, but the Water Arcanum is also failing." <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure, you don’t. Honestly, I can’t believe Tom let you do this at all. I always thought he liked you.” <EOS>
<BOS> Doesn’t take long before the task is underway. You eventually get a report from Marco that unfortunately despite the unexpected attack and all the people you sent, you only managed to get one of them, and it was the orc since they tried to take him out first believing he’d be a tougher target, turned out to be true since he killed most of the people you sent before succumbing to the multiple shots to his body and head in the initial attack. <EOS>
<BOS> The pair of you watch over him for some time, though eventually you start getting a little restless and tell Vera you’re going to get some work accomplished. Vera however, insists on staying with Kol. <EOS>
<BOS> “Let the bards sing of the last mountain monk, survivor of the monastery massacre, and conqueror of the Empire.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What the hell did they put into those drinks? Ground up unicorn testicles?” Vera says wiping her hands. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re telling the stories of Tanya to Vera, you’re also partially reliving some of the good times you experienced with her. You actually haven’t thought about those in awhile seeing as you were trying to keep her “out of your head” as much as you could. <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh? Wha?” Virgil sputters. <EOS>
<BOS> The Grandmaster places his hand on Samuel’s shoulder. “My friend, I do not blame you for seeking truth. You were foolish to seek it alone. Come, we will speak on this later. The king’s emissaries will soon be arriving for the Grand Melee.” <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re checking your supplies, you hear the sound of something approaching you. Dread grips your body, you hide behind the nearest tree and you draw your dagger. <EOS>
<BOS> Well you did, but you’re pretty sure he didn’t have this in mind. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, still trying to talk his way out of it is he? (Sigh) Fine. Let him get it over with, so we can get on with this in silence.” <EOS>
<BOS> She sighs. “That’s what some of the other kids call you. Since you aren’t one of us.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well not everyone has the magical ability to find me like you do, now come on and keep it down!” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> Randi is the red headed whore that lives down the hall. Unusual that she’d seek you out, since she’s snotty with you at the best of times. You guess it’s because you turned down her overly aggressive offer the first time you stepped into this inn. <EOS>
<BOS> “I know. It’ll be strange for me too since we’re so close, but maybe this will be for the best anyway. I mean have you heard some of more recent ugly rumors about us just because we’re twins?” <EOS>
<BOS> “This isn’t even counting the possibility that Layla might even be playing the long game here. I mean what if she’s counting on him falling in love with her? I mean he’s got magical powers, if push came to shove he start rebelling against us if we didn’t approve of her. Which we wouldn’t of course.” <EOS>
<BOS> "What's the old woman's name and where's she live?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Something like that, but I want you to tell him okay? Don’t forget.” you say and hand Virgil a few coppers. <EOS>
<BOS> There is an opportunity here and you’re not passing it up. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m sure you will. You’ll probably even cry over me for a while. The sadder thing is, it’ll still be more emotion than anyone else has ever shown me. I told you I’m in this for the long haul. So if that means you if I have to temporarily let you fuck other women and all this still possibly resulting in my death, then so fucking be it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You can’t assassinate him?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I thought about that and…well they’re just going to have to be losses for the greater goal. I mean I could warn everyone, but if it’s empty then that’s going to look might suspicious for you.” <EOS>
<BOS> But all things end, and some things begin. You have the ferry ride on the morrow, then on to the Grove of Muses - so close now! Ivani has waited long enough. <EOS>
<BOS> - The Empress's camel caravan is luxurious, but exclusive. She only approves a rare few to travel along with her private merchants and guards, but those who are allowed to are waited on like royalty. She does not charge them, but welcomes them as special guests. The Oasis is lush and beautiful, and the Tower itself is well attended by courtesans and supplicants - both would be an ideal spot to tell stories to rich and captive audiences. However, anyone meeting with the Empress must bring a gift, and her tastes are expensive and eclectic. If she isn't impressed, her mood can turn, and she has been known to have a few unlucky petitioners thrown into death-cage matches with legendary beasts, or forced to run behind one of her prized horses. Today she is holding an open audience for the people, and it will be possible to request - if she accepts the gift brought to her - passage in the caravan leaving tomorrow morning. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t know.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah, prayer! The last refuge of a scoundrel as they say. I’ve always disagreed with that though. Prayer can be a powerful tool. I should know as my dark father has blessed me with much since my dedicated prayer to him.” A voice says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Here you go heathen." Wendy remarks handing you the deed. <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course. The King protects our borders and in return we help protect him.” <EOS>
<BOS> No sooner have you picked it up again, you hear the voice again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well.” Layla remarks obediently and leaves. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, all I’m saying is Jake not causing shit for us in the city and running around out there like a mad man is better for us. If he’s gone, then the militia is just going to refocus more of their attention on the city again. I mean maybe it might be best to make it an official break up. Let Jake know he can go his way and we go ours. Might diffuse any potential problems with Jake. Dunno if Tom will be into that though.” Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> Wendy invites you in and tells you to excuse the mess as she doesn't do much cleaning nowadays. You find a chair to sit in and she does likewise. <EOS>
<BOS> And at this point blood is no longer just coming out of her mouth and given some of the other orifices, it isn’t all blood either. You are covered in blood, shit and vomit from nearly head to toe and that’s not the worst of it. <EOS>
<BOS> “While you have some good ideas as usual, honestly, I’m not sure why anything needs to be done about him. I say if Jake has split from the Crimson Talons, well that’s more for us.” Zalmora remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Ivani, my love," you stammer, "there is so much to talk about -" <EOS>
<BOS> “Nice? Good? Ha ha ha ha! That’s a cute. She’s with you, how good can she really be? Plus I know how she killed her old boyfriend with her little goblin influencing powers. Shit, that’s proof right there that’s she’s going to make a fine succubus. She’s already killing boyfriends. Speaking of which, you m’boy have to go.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Look kid, I’ll let you in on a little secret, I’ve jerked off thinking about Tanya too. I don’t think there’s a man that’s been in contact with her for any length of time that hasn’t. Hell, there’s been guys in the Guild into men and they STILL admitted to having thoughts about her. She had a dick of course in their fantasies, but my point is, she still had an effect. It’s part of her demon heritage, but the effects should have long since worn off and I’m telling you the way you’re going is not fucking healthy.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re awake sir, are you ready to go?” Claire asks. <EOS>
<BOS> While it probably isn’t going to cause the city to sink like how everyone is currently shouting and panicking about, it’s certainly going be a lot of damage to repair. <EOS>
<BOS> In a perfect world, this would be followed by them ceasing their harassment of you. In your world however, it means one of the thugs threw a dagger into your back. <EOS>
<BOS> "That's good. I remember how he was always struggling to go to class and run that inn. Couldn't have been easy. Hell, I didn't even have all that responsibility and I still flunked out of medical school. Lucky I managed to land a city job. Still though, he did help me a few times during class, so he was always okay in my book." <EOS>
<BOS> “More of a warning. Not sure if you realize it or not but security has increased a lot in the city. Granted a lot of that might be the fault of the Bloody Talons making such a mess of things, but the reasons don’t matter. What matters is, things are getting harder for people like us.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you’re within reach of the top of the tree, you desperately start grabbing at extended branches just within reach. You unsurprisingly break several of them trying to hang on, along with ripping your hands up pretty good. You’re very lucky you don’t get impaled and eventually you hit the ground bruising most of your body. You curse when you notice your pistol has broken into two pieces. <EOS>
<BOS> You smack Marco upside the head when you arrive. <EOS>
<BOS> Slowly, one by one, each man drops, a victim to the dark power. All that remains is Seth, standing among the fallen bodies of his allies. His eyes briefly dart to their bodies, taking in their death as motivation to continue. Seth’s twin blades arc low, then high in a sweeping motion, always working, intertwined, to find an opening in your defense. The Unbroken parries and deflects the blades away, even allowing one high strike to narrowly miss just above your head. You understand it’s turned into a game, one that the Unbroken will finish as soon as he’s done toying with your mentor. Seth lunges forward. <EOS>
<BOS> The only other nearby bastion of major civilization you can think of that’s close is another city state by the name of Holgard. It’s to the south and in terms of existence, it’s only a little older than you are. <EOS>
<BOS> Taking aim, your pull the trigger and shoot the wizard in the back. You were aiming for his head, but it seems to have done the trick anyway as the wizard goes down. All that magic and you figured he neglected a protection spell against more mundane dangers. <EOS>
<BOS> You nod. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh I imagine he had an escape plan in all this. We’ll catch up to him again sooner or later, I’m not worried. I made preparations.” <EOS>
<BOS> Making impulsive decisions based on other people’s suggestions isn’t something you normally do, but things here in Holgard have been one headache after another. Even if everything involving this potential invasion goes well, what’s going to be the next major incident? A freak tidal wave destroying the city? <EOS>
<BOS> “I’d tell you not to flatter yourself, but I think you know I have always found you quite attractive. Don’t even know why exactly, considering the first time we met you threatened me with rape.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Nope, never got around to it." <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, but nowadays we sort of just breed them. It’s a lot easier than catching them.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, no, no, this isn’t how we’re playing this. At least not yet. We’re both going to just stand here and talk while we wait for some of my people to come back.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh big surprise coming from someone who takes dick like a pussy.” Camid shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well let’s just say many people would be upset with you. If you’re concerned with being timely however, you can probably buy a horse with some of that new money, over in Hegglesburg. You should reach that town by tomorrow and they might have a horse you can buy.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure, if you want. Not like I could stop you from doing so if I wanted to anyway.” You say <EOS>
<BOS> You shoot Sneaks causing his body to jerk back with enough force that he falls back on his chair to the floor. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s fine. It was a long time ago…but I don’t remember the Nerothians burning you. Where did you get all these burn marks on your hands and face?” <EOS>
<BOS> You can now, with my aid. Together, we will overthrow the Emperor. I will teach you to control the power, to control the voice. If left unchecked, it will consume you. <EOS>
<BOS> You spy your pistol on the floor and you grab it, but as strange as it may be, you aren’t sure who to use it on. <EOS>
<BOS> The place is empty save for a few drunks face down on tables. A frowning thin girl with a pale complexion sit behind a bar. It's already apparent she isn't welcoming. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well I’m not a damn stupid teenager anymore that gets distracted by a pretty girl that wiggles her ass at me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, let’s just say things change. Sometimes old antagonists can be new allies, or at least non-antagonists. In fact you happen to be one reason why the Syndicate isn’t actively sabotaging me this time. Indeed, when I liberate Holgard, some of the orc mercenaries that the Syndicate provided will be actively targeting the Nocturnal League. They aren’t exactly happy with you for some reason.” <EOS>
<BOS> Makes you wonder though how things might have been different if you’d run to Klyton instead of Holgard. In any case, you’re not here to sight see; you’re here in the hopes that your condition can get cured or dispelled or whatever they have to do. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well?” <EOS>
<BOS> “What? Why should I do that?” <EOS>
<BOS> You get closer and then pull out your pistol. Warts eyes go big for a moment. <EOS>
<BOS> But the days are peaceful, and there are many birds. You carve them little cabins to rest in and simple baths to splash in. Each night, you fall asleep to their soft trills and low warbles, and for one precious moment before sleep can feel the brush of soft hands on your wrinkled brow. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s not Marco, he’s been killed!” a voice says from the other side of the door. <EOS>
<BOS> “You fuckers and your Halfling dicks aren’t going to do shit! Now get the fuck out of here, before my boyfriend pulls out his pistol!” <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya doesn’t seem to acknowledge your gratitude though; instead she pulls you closer to her. At this distance, even in the darkness, you can make out her normally shrouded face. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well you can’t get good unless you practice!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hold on, let’s be careful. Don’t really feel like stumbling into any Bloody Talons right now, especially with this stash.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You get no answer, what you do get is a kiss on your lips. The feeling is unlike anything you’ve ever experienced. It’s very pleasant, but as it goes on, you start to feel weak. In fact you try to pull away, but when you do so, Tanya’s eyes glow red, she makes a growling sound and then shoves your away. <EOS>
<BOS> "Zal, what's up? I thought you were in the office." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re more in favor of ousting Tom. After all you’ve been putting most of the major effort into this organization, while Tom doesn’t seem to give a shit at all and you don’t see why he should be running things if that’s the case. <EOS>
<BOS> “So why blame me? I haven’t been anywhere on this world until you summoned me.” <EOS>
<BOS> And of course nobody is around to see all this despite it being broad daylight. Or maybe they’re just watching from windows and don’t care. You’re not exactly popular after all. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit. Should have left when I had the chance.” You say and leave the carriage as quick as you can. <EOS>
<BOS> But the days are peaceful, and there are many birds. You carve them little cabins to rest in and simple baths to splash in. Each night, you fall asleep to their soft trills and low warbles, and for one precious moment before sleep can feel the brush of soft hands on your wrinkled brow. <EOS>
<BOS> “You mean like possession?” <EOS>
<BOS> "I didn't say all that, but we ARE providing for them in a way. I mean we can start out by digging ourselves out a proper headquarters where we don't have to be constantly bombarded by the smells of the sewer and has a solid defense, but I'm thinking in time we could just build a whole underground town." <EOS>
<BOS> “I thought about visiting you in your dreams, but then I thought the personal touch would be much more satisfying.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay! No need to snap at me. I just thought I’d ask since it’s been awhile since we were in the same location.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Come on, we need to get the hell out of here.” You say and rush to the barricaded door, though some books on the floor suddenly distract Gwen. <EOS>
<BOS> You look around the assembled group, both people you've gotten to know from the caravan as well as people of Salt Village. <EOS>
<BOS> Afterwards you’re collapsed on the bed, while “Tanya” professionally starts to collect herself. <EOS>
<BOS> “Something has to be done about Jake.” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> “She’s no longer with us either. She was murdered by some unknown assailant nearly a month ago. Very tragic.” <EOS>
<BOS> “SHIT!” Gertrude shouts and at this point loses all of her confidence and tries to run. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, but it always seems like you’re doing these things and expecting a certain consistent behavior. I mean she’s a woman not a dog.” <EOS>
<BOS> “As you say boss, oh um…Countess, are you visiting the news mines that we’re operating now?” Marco asks. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s a good thing you finish right at that moment, because Vera’s own release was not just from her mouth this time. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re REALLY going to have to do better than that Vera.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I get what you mean on that, but this plan of yours still seems pretty dangerous. Not only are we risking war with the ECS, the Felians, but the god itself.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Not needed, Rexx. Mira here is simply helping me sleep.” <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe you’re a little paranoid but you don’t feel comfortable going to a meeting in unfamiliar territory with someone who you know virtually nothing about save for what Vera’s managed to tell you. Peter could see this as an opportunity to take you out as a potential obstacle to his conquest. Vera by herself on the other hand is less of a target, not to mention she’s got a pirate boyfriend with her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay. I’m in. I stayed here for you this long and I’m not going to leave when you need my help the most. So, let’s get to this plan of yours.” <EOS>
<BOS> “More or less. You guys always fall a bit short, but at least I wasn’t dealing with Jake’s whiskey dick this time around. Thanks for asking though at least.” <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t exchange any more words with her and you exit the establishment. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora just looks at you. <EOS>
<BOS> You did not see that one coming. Of course you never knew his parents either. <EOS>
<BOS> “Can’t be any worse than what I’ve already been through.” <EOS>
<BOS> Later on in the week after the noise has died down from Klyton's most recent repressive tactics, you call a meeting to address everyone of the new changes that are going to be taking place. <EOS>
<BOS> “Excuse me, I’m new here and I’m looking for the medical school.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ideally that would be the safest move in the short term, but not in the long term and if we are going to war with them, I’d like to be sure that it’s necessary. So far they haven’t given any indication that they’re planning anything other than an aggressive business exchange that would have them visiting here on occasion…which granted could lead to problems in the future. In any case, we’ll wait for now.” <EOS>
<BOS> There might be a rock cave in the foothills - you remember passing a few, tiny things not much larger than a man. Yes, there is one! Not even large enough to stand up in, but it looks big enough to lay out a blanket and sleep for the night, maybe even make a fire. <EOS>
<BOS> Even you know it's over when another mermaid appears right in front of you and you lock eyes directly with her. (Right after you stare at her green scaly tits for a split second of course) <EOS>
<BOS> Silence. <EOS>
<BOS> "Dragons, of course," a lady with a pink hat answers. "And diverting board games." <EOS>
<BOS> “I put out several announcements around campus for an escort job. Hmmm….you don’t look like a warrior and you’re a little young. You one of those students over from the magic college?” <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sigh) Damn it….” You say to yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera…Vera…shhhhh…calm down…” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re about to answer yes, but then on reflection you stop yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe I need to try harder then.” You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> At twilight, the caravan halts once more. Tents are set up again, this time in a cluster, with the camels ringing round it in a circle. A central fire is lit, sausages roasted, and wine served. Some days, they ask you to give a tale, and you oblige. You hope these weeks will see the last of your financial concerns! <EOS>
<BOS> Shifting your weight slightly, you brace for painful impact of attempting to hit every branch on the way down. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well?” the captain remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Where to go though is the issue. Lacking any other ideas, you suppose you’ll head to Hessla and take it from there. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm not sure I can go on into the future," you whisper. But Ivani would not want you to give up. And your pain is your penance - even if it were necessary, you have destroyed something beautiful and bright. <EOS>
<BOS> “So you’re saying I’m stupid as well? You know what, you’ve been doing a lot of fucking talking, trying to fool me. Well I’m not fooled. You’ve obviously charmed Keira with your words and turned her against me!” <EOS>
<BOS> "Muse-mad," others whisper. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 36 <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh? I…uh…buh…I waz just…” Warts slurs as he sits up and just manages to not hit his head on the table. <EOS>
<BOS> “Probably all bullshit anyway considering Lloyd was stealing from the Syndicate.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm as ready as ever," you shrug and follow him up the gangway. <EOS>
<BOS> “Uh huh. Listen, I hear that excuse all the time and sometimes its even true, but you were found with twenty vials of Blue Dream my boy. You didn’t just stumble upon that, you’re obviously working for someone bigger. Probably someone in the Ebony Claw Syndicate. If you’re really sorry for what you’ve done, then you’re going to have to give me more than the baby in woods act.” <EOS>
<BOS> You spend the next few days in the forest getting yourself more lost despite the fact that you thought you were logically following a trail. You imagine they headed to Spiderfang territory but its not like you even know if you’re close to there or not. <EOS>
<BOS> While all this is mildly fascinating, you think it’s time to get to business. <EOS>
<BOS> You leave Yinen’s parents to their grief and dead son. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I guess you could say relations are strained with Hessla, but we offered them a fair deal. Their Governor is the one that decided to be greedy and reject it. His unwillingness to embrace in a positive manner change is what is causing people to do less business there. He probably fears that I’m going to come there with a fleet and take his city like I did with Jicol, but it’s not even the same situation. The Nocturnal League doesn’t seek to expand past our reach. This island is more than enough territory for us.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Am I now? Funny, I usually get called a hedge witch at best and a charlatan that sells distilled goblin dung at worst…well I suppose that last bit is true, but I save that for the asshole customers.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It is not uncommon for the spirit to search for a more powerful host. There is a fine line between choosing to possess a strong host, and being destroyed in the attempt. If the spirit grows too ambitious, they may find themselves facing a being too powerful. That’s why shades primarily inhabit sorcerers who overstep in their search for powerful magic. <EOS>
<BOS> You cut your way through to the Imperial commander. Off in the distance, you see Horne masterfully backstabbing fleeing Empire troops. His talent for blending in extends to the battlefield, using the chaotic setting to catch his enemy unaware. The commander stands between two fully-plated knights with kiteshields. The commander’s thick mustache covers his top lip, but even then, you can see the tremble underneath. <EOS>
<BOS> You find yourself at a crossroad. You’ve won countless small battles against the Empire. Each time, another Imperial command replaces the one before. The resources you oppose are seemingly endless. Yours, on the other hand, is dwindling. Richard left years ago, returning back to his village. The act didn’t surprise you. He had only helped to drive the Imperial soldiers from wandering too near to his family. You’ve become a small band of freedom fighters, outcasts, renegades, wanderers with no place to call home, led by Seth. <EOS>
<BOS> "It's not just because most storytellers tend to be degenerate bums. The High Mage and others fear that the muses - what is left of them, that is - are somehow taking the stories and the dreams, but have grown discontent, and are now stealing from memory and magic as well." <EOS>
<BOS> You hear a bunch of footsteps and then you feel a couple sets of hands lifting you up and finally a fist coming straight at your face. <EOS>
<BOS> But when you touch her back, it is hard. And she, too, has bits of dappled gray throughout her flesh, giving her a piebald appearance. When the wind briefly snatches her hair away, you see that her eyes are opened, if unfocused, a deep and translucent green like clear twilight. How could you have forgotten such a color? <EOS>
<BOS> You bow, then hold out the small box, which a guard takes for her to examine. "Your Imperial Majesty, I am Dustan Palmer of the southern continent, Syphyr, come to bring you tribute." <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile you’re partially watching from the distance and still wincing in pain from falling. You didn’t break anything, but your back hurts like hell. As quick as you can walk, you make your way over to the tipped over carriage. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually it's just you as the Talons still left alive have fled your side fearing that they'll be next on this list of mysterious disappearances. You have lost everything and the militia wasn't even involved. <EOS>
<BOS> Makes you wonder if his quietness also has something to do with Fel. You still haven’t seen any of the evidence of shadow magic like your wife or Gertrude have though. <EOS>
<BOS> No sooner do you get closer to where the entrance would be located and several of the slavers are hanging around. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes, but he's also my son! Really now sir, would YOU force your son to do something he doesn't want to? Yes, business is always important, but sometimes, just sometimes family comes first. Now if Henry wants to work for you on this, I suppose we can start coming up with a price, but I don't think it's likely." <EOS>
<BOS> “Well for one thing, I was always kept in the fucking courtyard for the most part. I didn’t really catch wind of a lot of this until recently and I still didn’t know what was bullshit and what wasn’t. Mr. Dream once bragged that he shut down a brothel once because he wore out all the women that night, and I know damn well that didn’t happen because he barely could last five minutes with the Blue Dream whores if the jokes were any indication. I wanted to collect more information first before moving forward on it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, he’s kinda scary. I’ve never seen him. It’s just like…I dunno…a voice. It’s loud, but it’s like whispery. I don’t know if he means to be scary though.” <EOS>
<BOS> It wasn’t easy, but after Narrow’s Edge fell, a direct route into the Empire was created, allowing you to travel in and out of the territory quickly. You are still vastly outnumbered, but the quality of your soldiers are equally overshadowing of the Empire’s. You recruit and train real warriors, rather than conscripting farmers and laborers. A smaller force requires you to prioritize mobility and to strike hard, fast, never fighting the beast head on. <EOS>
<BOS> Time to take a trip to the university, specifically to the school of arts. Personally you’ve always tended to stay away from that area due to the unbearable pretentiousness and the fact that the fuckers never much coin to their name. Must be nice not having to do shit all day and having your expensive “education” being paid for you. <EOS>
<BOS> You pull out the golden brooch and he whistles. "Shiny. Not shiny enough. Maybe if it was a slow day." <EOS>
<BOS> “You always did have a thing for me didn’t you?” <EOS>
<BOS> “To the Empire’s victory,” the Captain salutes, clinking the two cups together. <EOS>
<BOS> After your ocean voyage, the ground feels unsteady beneath your feet. And Scaleport is crowded - it's quite easily the largest city you have been in since before you married Ivani. You wander around the smaller shops and nearer to the port until you feel a bit more sure-footed. Most buildings have flat roofs and are coated in some sort of red clay or paste mixed with gravel, giving everything a sort of rough and mottled look. Yet in contrast to the plain and uneven architecture, you often see ornate chimes made of wire wrapped stones, bits of fancy glass, and giant scales of some kind that shimmer in the morning light. <EOS>
<BOS> You decide to take your chances with the merchant caravan. At least you are paying them for safety! If something happened to you, wouldn't their reputation be damaged? There are the rumors of missing passengers, however - while you assumed those were related to those who were unable to pay for extended caravan benefits, is it possible the merchants are directly behind them? <EOS>
<BOS> Brother Samuel silently reads the scroll, softly moving his lips as if pronouncing the words. Satisfied at his ability, he speaks the incantation. Nothing happens and he repeats it again. Still nothing. Finally, he shouts the incantation. <EOS>
<BOS> You wake up the next day a little later than usual and find Annah going through her bags. You also hear the sound of music and mild revelry in the distance. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you that quick to return to bed? There’s too many for just us three, even with a surprise attack,” Richard answers. <EOS>
<BOS> Like the sissy he is, he breaks down crying on the floor clutching his broken finger, meanwhile you’ve already drawn your pistol on the teenage girl. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I’m confused. Based on my observations of how I’ve seen you look at women, I know damn well you like girls. In fact, I’ve noticed you even checking me out on occasion and your dick was getting hard when I was touching it so I know it can’t be because you find me repulsive. And I doubt if you have any moral objections…” Vera says before you interrupt. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well okay, it isn't going to be the Klyton coliseum, but it'll be a proper fighting area where we can put a ring and have people watching and betting without them accidentally stepping in shit water." <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, if you’re still expecting me to give you any water you’re doing a piss poor job at convincing me.” You say getting a bit agitated and stepping closer to the cage. <EOS>
<BOS> You shake your head. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh yeah, the Spider Fang tribe, but there don’t really come around the way we’re goin’ so no need to worry about getting’ eaten. Can’t wait to get back to them though. With these rings, Snuffit will allow me at least ten ruts with ‘er. Way better than getting’ drunk…well sometimes better anyway.” Warts remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> You seriously don’t remember it being this good before. Not that it was ever really bad with her, but this is something else. She’s either learned something in the time you’ve been apart or she’s been holding back all this time. <EOS>
<BOS> “Convince me.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Kragan Firehand has to be at least two hundred years old. He doesn’t visit the village anymore, but receives visitors and councils the village elders in times of trouble. Due to his age, he is unable to offer any direct protection of the village, but does sell weapons, armor, and potions to the populace as needed. His tall stone tower is right on the edge of the forest’s old growth, but his magics keep him quite secure within. <EOS>
<BOS> Currently the Guild doesn’t have any plans other than the one involving the Neroth worshippers and making it look like the EC are attacking them. The only other plan you can tell Rook is your plan directly against Reginald, you just aren’t sure Rook’s going to find that one important enough and you’ll end up having give out the Guild’s plan anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> “Your question is accusatory and I don’t know what you’re talking about with all this assassination business. If you believe that my intentions are not what they seem then why not act?” <EOS>
<BOS> At one time, you did toy with the possibility of going “legit” somehow. Like maybe buying an inn and running it. Maybe even the one your family once owned. It would sure be a complete circle if you did that. <EOS>
<BOS> You explain in a little more detail about what happened and Yinen starts to look more concerned. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, and the one slaver ship was sunk during the initial volley.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Um…” <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Ludmilla begins speaking to Vera and you excuse yourself to get a drink. While you don’t normally do so, you get the impression you’re going to need a bit of extra help to get through the night. <EOS>
<BOS> Prince Ragar nods. <EOS>
<BOS> “I wasn’t going to kill you! And I would have stood up to the ECS if they tried!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, a god.” <EOS>
<BOS> Quite frankly you're doing better than most men would be able to in your position, but unfortunately you're only human and the mermaids are relentless. <EOS>
<BOS> “What’re you doing?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “And you told me, that you’ve remained loyal for the past twenty some odd years since that time at first because you originally felt obligated to Garrick for giving you a home and helping you when nobody else was, but there was a point when you started to feel less satisfied here and you considered leaving.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> One morning, the coldest of the year, the noble released the nightingale into the air as the sun’s shadow marked nine on the sundial. He admired his pet, watching for a minute as the red bird circled, then turned to take his betrothed for a walk until the hour was over. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re dead baby.” Madeline remarks while stroking your face. <EOS>
<BOS> You bid Heather goodbye and make your way back home where you get back to business. Though you’re a little concerned about Vera getting back okay. <EOS>
<BOS> After giving Percy some suggestions he shakes your hand and thanks you before leaving. As for you, you don’t feel like going back to work right away either. You dismiss your hob crew and tell the Felians to just go back to whatever it is they do since you just want a moment by yourself (Even if you are still in a tavern) <EOS>
<BOS> “So? I know what grounds she prefers and that’s where we’re going. Now you’re coming with me or I’m going to break your legs and drag you out of here.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh ‘ere he is. Fuckin’ thought you’d never show up.” One says. <EOS>
<BOS> The soldier who escorted you here explains to Peter the situation and his attention is immediately caught. He tells the rest of the soldiers at his table to clear so that you may sit and talk. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’ll be fine. Just remember what I said. You’ve got more talent than you think and you could definitely do well out there too.” <EOS>
<BOS> Miraculously, despite losing nearly all your other possessions in the river, you still have one extra dagger on your person. You draw it, but you don’t have a positive feeling about your chances. <EOS>
<BOS> You soon meet up with Zal. <EOS>
<BOS> "If I was doing such a thing, I'm not sure why it would matter to you." <EOS>
<BOS> Rows of children move in unison, reacting to the teacher’s instruction. Their feet step at exactly the same moment creating a single, thunderous clap. <EOS>
<BOS> Be that as it may, it would seem that Gwen found something to harm Tanya because she unleashes a blast of magic energy straight into her back causing a monstrous howl. <EOS>
<BOS> And with those words, the magistrate’s soldiers start escorting you out the office and soon out the building as well. <EOS>
<BOS> "Hm, okay. I should tell you, I don't actually expect you to go completely off the stuff. I just wanted you sober for today while I speak to you. I also expect you to not drink on the job and generally be a functional human being. Now you're going to have some help in this matter since Vaughn here is going to be personally responsible for you. Making sure you stay focused and such." <EOS>
<BOS> "Muse loyalists. Foolish rioters. Normally, they wouldn't have been a problem - but something is wrong with magic." <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad you asked. You see, while Warts was inviting you all here in a civilized manner to join me, I was having a discussion with a group that might be less willing to see reason…” You say before you’re interrupted. <EOS>
<BOS> “You pissed?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> As you hide behind a partially destroyed building. Deafening explosions are all around you. Temporary loss of hearing aside, you’re otherwise fine. You look out from the rubble and still see Heather encased in a glowing blue shield of some sort. However, you also see several smaller boats rowing towards docks. Heather’s putting up a good fight, but you need to go help her. <EOS>
<BOS> You declined that offer though. You’ve always said members are free to pray to whoever they want, but if they’re going to be wrapped up in Fel (or whoever) that hardcore then they can go take up some black robes and start living in their temple’s meditation rooms. The less religion you have in your organization the better. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well, get to it." Captain Brost grunts, and wipes his hands on his dirty leather apron. No, not dirt, you realize. A dozen shades of blood, from crimson to near black. <EOS>
<BOS> Several of them are incinerated instantly by Dornan spells. Gloom himself manages to cut down a single acolyte before he’s finally brought down by some spell that causes him to age rapidly and then fall over dead. <EOS>
<BOS> You place your hand on Seth’s shoulder. “Let them sing what they will. A man’s actions are his own, not to be influenced or swayed by others.” <EOS>
<BOS> Predictable. Stupid ass teenager doesn’t have a plan. <EOS>
<BOS> “Just catching up on some long-needed sleep. The castle quarters were getting a little tight for my care.” <EOS>
<BOS> Zamed now gives you a look like he wants to do something, but instead spits near your feet and walks away. You tell your hobs to keep close to you and be ready for anything. <EOS>
<BOS> But as the months wore on in the land of ice, and the summer frosts changed to the deep snow drifts of winter, the nightingale grew restless. “I was born free! Why I have I become content to slave in exchange for a mere hour?” <EOS>
<BOS> “What you gave me isn’t enough for the one I want!” <EOS>
<BOS> If anything the crime is less than one might think mainly because most are pirates and pillaging other places rather than here. You are surprisingly finding the place a bit easy on the pick pocket and theft front, of course a lot of folks are either half drunk or plain drunk most of the time. Also most folks don't seem to own that many personal belongings. You guess with most making their living at sea, they keep essentials on their ships, spend it all on booze and whores or otherwise live a very basic life, so despite you finding the town a bit easy pickings, you aren't getting rich doing it. Shops however are very well protected by the Headsmen since you guess Governor Tolen has a slice of all the businesses here. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, that’s what I figure too. Anyway Marco, don’t bother having anyone send a response, everyone has more important shit to do than worry about Hessla.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well I figured I needed to get over my fears if this is going to be our new headquarters. I have to say, it is a lot better than that front we’re currently using. I still have my concerns though. Are you really sure we’re not pissing off some divine being doing this?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck!” You say and begin to struggle. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hank. Hank. HANK!” you shout. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well if I stay here, they’re even more likely to find me. They probably aren’t going to bother looking for me anyway. And wouldn’t you be with me?” <EOS>
<BOS> You suddenly receive one of the many sketches a concerned citizen is handing out. You take one look at the sketch as you walk away from the crowd and shake your head. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hold on…fuck…” you mutter realizing that today must be the fucking day that the entire Syndicate declares war. <EOS>
<BOS> The man who “killed” a demon summoned by a rogue mage seeking to destroy the city. <EOS>
<BOS> “Zal?!” you call out. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t have much information on you, but I do have enough to know that you have an uncanny knack of survival. The Ebony Claw Syndicate provided some of that information.” <EOS>
<BOS> But in the dark hours predawn you find yourself rudely awoken and half stuffed into a sack. You try to cry out - only, your voice will no longer work. Some sort of spell? <EOS>
<BOS> Fortunately, he doesn’t get the chance due to all his gloating which was enough time for Tanya to finish off her last opponent and run over to help you again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that was the pact I had set up with some friends of mine. If any of us ever got thrown in one of these cages, one of the others would help as soon as possible.” <EOS>
<BOS> What is more interesting to you however is when you stumble upon rooms still filled with a few objects. Mostly vases and such, but you do find some more valuable items as well. Soon you’ve got a bunch of teenagers arguing over treasure and you have to remind them… <EOS>
<BOS> You soon say goodbye to Vera and start getting things in order. The Syndicate rep should be by in another week, you figure you can tell him directly that you wish to speak with someone higher up on the food chain about turning your holdings over. <EOS>
<BOS> You walk carefully around the room making sure you don’t step on any symbols or inside any circles just in case. You also keep an eye on the demonic idols, which still feel like they’re watching you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Quick, get him now!” <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes! He's just been in the gutter for so long his self esteem is low! I mean once he gets back in action he'll be fine!" Vaughn exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> "So, I guess we need to get started on setting up the new business." <EOS>
<BOS> You nod, trying not to retort that 100 silver actually isn't all that much for a month of labor. But it still is a hefty sum, which will help with the next part of the journey. <EOS>
<BOS> He introduces himself as Captain Rifiv and says he hopes you prove to be a better crewman than the lot that got themselves killed recently. Especially since you're apparently the ONLY person Scully was able to recruit! <EOS>
<BOS> “You sure?” <EOS>
<BOS> You call for Flynn to help you and even Heather starts to scream for assistance as it seems she is not completely in control of her own body. <EOS>
<BOS> “Just – thank you, for your story.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Another idiot outsider thinking they can just rip us off. Honestly don't know what goes through their heads. I mean we're a pirate town! Would YOU steal from anyone in a town full of fucking pirates?" Another says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shut up, you’re breaking the fantasy.” Vera replies. <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno. Anywhere! Maybe Klyton, or Holgard or even the Delantium Kingdom. I’ll figure it out during my travels. Just anywhere, but here.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What the hell?! This is NOT a good idea!” you shout. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, that’s not a bad idea though. I mean it might it be a bit of a trip and take some work in cleaning up, but having something defensible like that would be a lot better than the current tavern front we’re operating out of.” <EOS>
<BOS> The second isn't merely a passage, but a veritable gauntlet of blood and death. It begins under the Shrine of Coruscal, the blood god. Your general knowledge of the cults ways and the gods they serve may aid you, but the rumor is only those with deep, personal experiences of horror or death will make it through. Accessing it, however, is fairly easy - they let anyone try their hands at it, no questions ask, and claim the bodies for their own dark rituals. <EOS>
<BOS> "I assure you, I don't..." <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya…” <EOS>
<BOS> Despite the high costs of a formal education of a person growing up in his middle class background, his parents who ran an inn, scraped together enough money to send him to a university and for awhile the young man was able to pursue his dreams. <EOS>
<BOS> You arrive just in time for Elana to finish bitching at the desk clerk and start bitching at you instead. <EOS>
<BOS> “No. Actually don’t know what ever happened to him. He just disappeared when the Thieves Guild got destroyed. Guess he could still be dead though.” <EOS>
<BOS> While conflict can be good for business, there sometimes is a point when it starts becoming a hindrance. Especially when the wrong side is winning. <EOS>
<BOS> “Here we go…” <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t sure how long you’re asleep, but you open your eyes when you start hearing voices nearby. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. Okay, sure. But more bullets again? Are you planning to shoot everyone in Holgard? I didn’t realize you used it so much, I would think such a loud weapon would incur too much noise in your profession.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Well it seems like you're a motivated young man with a plan ahead of you. Hope everything goes okay for you and your wife. We definitely need more upstanding citizens such as yourselves trying to build up this city rather than contributing to its decline. We don't want to end up like Hessla or Holgard!" Quincy remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> You soon look on in horror as a surge of water starts coming at you. You don’t even have time to run. More explosions are heard and then the water hits you hard. You struggle to swim as the torrent takes you, but with now water seemingly rising and pouring in from everywhere, you can’t even find an air pocket. <EOS>
<BOS> “Perhaps, but you would have been still dead.” <EOS>
<BOS> Each of the men was determined to win. <EOS>
<BOS> “Bah, one of these days I’m going to get a bigger cup,” he mutters to himself and rises from his seat. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, consider this my way of making amends for troubling you because I’ve come up with a plan that might benefit the both of us.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, she was trying to prey upon my paranoia with the Syndicate, claiming that you would eventually turn against me and other shit. Also during that whole getting Dornan help against the Joachimites, I fucked her once.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Bivedos's mottled husk gives you pause, as he blinks at you with yellow eyes like the sun. Somehow, his stone form nods, able to move. He closes his eyes and you swing. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, Gwen? Eh, we just sort of have fun sometimes, but it’s not really serious. I kind of think she’s hesitant to get too involved anyway. Probably just as well given my general grim outlook on relationship of any kind.” <EOS>
<BOS> You know Vera made a brief argument last night about this. At the time you weren’t really thinking straight to really take it into proper consideration and you half believed she just really wanted your dick. And while that still might be true, it doesn’t mean she isn’t wrong. <EOS>
<BOS> You weren’t there to witness it first hand, but the assassination attempt is a failure. Shade is even killed in the process, brought down by some sort of divine light that utterly melted him. The sight was so impressive that anyone who was on the fence about joining the Joachimites became a believer that day. <EOS>
<BOS> ANNAH!” you shout and now you’re the one that’s going out of your mind. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya…” you say and walk over to her, but she pulls away a bit when you go to touch her. <EOS>
<BOS> As quick as you can, you try to make it over to Zal, who keeps telling you to go back. <EOS>
<BOS> Rook looks like an assassin of some sort, but it’s obvious that he’s also a man that prides himself on how he looks since even in this dirty alley he stands out as being dressed more like a government official rather than some lowly thug. <EOS>
<BOS> “She’s in her room I think…um don’t tell her I said so, but she iz sorta pretty. I mean she wouldn’t be MY type, but y’know dressed like she iz right now, she looks like of doze princesses or sumthin. Hah, Vera a princess, dat’s funny.” <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t sure if it’ll make you feel any better about this, but you’re fairly certain it isn’t going to make you feel any worse. <EOS>
<BOS> "Good mage," you address the severe man, "would you suggest an item?" <EOS>
<BOS> “By the gods…” you say suddenly coming to an epiphany. <EOS>
<BOS> “I can’t believe this.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Then the kingdom is worse off, not having you as king. I’ve known you all your life, prince. You would make a great king.” <EOS>
<BOS> "His boyfriend is a militia guy. I'm sure if it was really serious, he would have already let us know. He's probably just got some minor cold and decided it would be a good excuse to take off from work. He's done that before you know." <EOS>
<BOS> You shake your head just thinking about how long ago that was. <EOS>
<BOS> “Killed both of them. They are no longer an issue. I anticipate that Peter will have no choice but to abandon his invasion now.” <EOS>
<BOS> Dusk doesn’t even blink at your request, he just agrees. Truly a beaten man from a beaten organization. <EOS>
<BOS> As soon as you say that, everyone looks at you and then also looks at Tanya who is also looking in your direction with her head cocked to the side almost intrigued by what you’re going to say next. <EOS>
<BOS> Not to mention you’re starting to get paranoid that the whole place might get raided one day. Klyton is just becoming more of a problem to operate in everyday. You start to think that maybe its time to leave. <EOS>
<BOS> “Someone isn’t up on their guide to infernals because you can’t command me to do shit for you. This one probably isn’t in most books about us because it isn’t a common occurrence, but you cannot command an infernal whose heart belongs to someone. And my heart unfortunately belongs to this mortal until he dies or purposely breaks it. And in any case, this circle you made to hold me doesn’t even have the correct symbols on it…” <EOS>
<BOS> In this manner, the serpent tricked all the animals, until at last he slithered back to his own nest and laid the 12 pieces out. <EOS>
<BOS> You settle down by your patch of the wall. Traveling with the merchants wasn't your first choice, but at least you've acquired a ride north. <EOS>
<BOS> You go back and forth on this many times. <EOS>
<BOS> You also remember Mr. Reynolds saying Henry's mother's name was Wendy. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes, I think there was one of those classless bum fights going on at the time when he arrived. Large crowd, but don't worry, he got them all." <EOS>
<BOS> You reach for the blunderbuss and upon grasping it, the carriage hits a bump in the road, which temporarily causes you to teeter and sway. Unfortunately this is enough time to allow the driver to realize what you’re attempting to do. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, they are. What are you exactly proposing Heather?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well to be honest, if she IS planning that I can’t say as I’m too mad about it. I mean she’s pretty much doing the only thing she can in her position which admittedly better than most, but still a slave nonetheless.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I haven’t fucked her! In fact NOTHING has happened between us!” <EOS>
<BOS> You nod and soon the pair of you are in another carriage and heading over to your inn. You arrive at the Galloping Mare where Claire leads you to your room and you immediately head over to the bed and get some rest. You figure you won’t sleep too long since you already slept a little on the ride to Klyton. <EOS>
<BOS> You manage to avoid getting pelted by gore again by hiding behind an alchemical counter. <EOS>
<BOS> "Um, dunno much. I think her name's Annie and I do know she swears more than the three of us put together. She came down here to retrieve her brother a couple times and every other word that came out of her mouth was some variation of fuck." Vaughn says. <EOS>
<BOS> What gains your attention however is you recognize one of these people. It’s Annah! <EOS>
<BOS> “I swear I don’t really like you leaving our son with her.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Once again, glad that this is a joint effort though I don’t think it was necessary to bring as many people with you as you did. The orb is going to nullify all magic and when that happens, those Dornan priests aren’t going to be much match for us.” Gloom says. <EOS>
<BOS> Now Garrick lifts up the table and flips it at you. For an older guy, he’s certainly fit. <EOS>
<BOS> This is some fucked up shit and while you aren’t exactly sure what these fuckers are going to do to you, you are not going to just wait around to find out. <EOS>
<BOS> “Nah, I was visiting mom and dad recently and they said you wrote a letter to them a couple years ago saying you had a new job assisting the baroness here. Even showed it to me. I think they were both pretty skeptical, but I had to see for myself, so here I am!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmmm, I see where you’re going with this. You’re saying we wouldn’t have to rely on Jicol’s docks to trade with pirates, smugglers and some corrupt merchants if shit really went bad for us. Good idea, but I can’t imagine the government is going to just let us get away doing that.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What the hell are you doing? Are you trying to upset her and shorten your relative paradise? Just go with it, stupid!” you think to yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> You arrive just in time to see a crowd disperse before a group of musicians that apparently have just finished performing. Shame, from what little you heard, it sounded pretty good. You go and get yourself another drink and that’s when you start to feel a little odd. Whatever this stuff is, it’s apparently stronger than the taste would indicate. Still, it’s a party right? Might as well try to loosen up. <EOS>
<BOS> Gwen backs off and nods. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I’ll have more of the members brought here to protect the place.” Rook remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, so here’s the ultimate question. Why?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Niro took a step back as egg shucks fell towards him. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 34 <EOS>
<BOS> “I do too, because despite what you may have heard about us, you will soon see that if you’re in this line of work, joining the Ebony Claw really is the way of the future. As I’m sure you’re somewhat aware, you’ve come at an interesting time. There are some changes going on in this city. Rebellion in the air, rumors of demonic cultists, but none of that matters. Business is what matters. What matters is that WE come out on top when smoke clears. The best way we can do that, is by controlling as much of the criminal activity as possible. By uniting the Underworld under one organization we will be able to survive whatever chaos is to come. That is the goal of the Ebony Claw Syndicate…well at least one of the goals anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> This however you have no idea… <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, fake… youz really didn’t know?” <EOS>
<BOS> "They did come for you," he whispers. "I told them you'd been staying in Mandi and never came back. Made it look like you ran off with your camel into the night. They might figure out it's still around, when they do the inventory at the end of the trip, but for now you should be safe. Stay out of sight as much as you can. When we get to Disbrook, slip out before morning and get to the ferry for the first ride. Don't wait for the merchants, in case they think to check the ferry passengers. I'll meet you later, on the other side, at the Fat Cat Brewery." He clicks his tongue, and his camel moves forward before you can mouth more than a thank-you. <EOS>
<BOS> "Damn shame. I remember Tom saying the place was fairly nice back when Edmond ran the Talons out of there." <EOS>
<BOS> "Don't mind her." Ronin laughs, "she just worries. A lot. I just have a bit of a cold, nothing so serious." <EOS>
<BOS> “Sis! It’s damn good to see you after twenty years!” you say and immediately go to her and give her a hug. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, Virgil. When the hell was the last time you washed? You fucking smell worse than a troll’s ass. Granted I’ve never smelled a troll’s ass, but I think it’s a safe bet you smell worse than one.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> "He has the starsight! Let him be!" the Head Mage warns. "Brokolis, show us what he sees." <EOS>
<BOS> Getting Grayhaze’s supplies to her is also a concern, you’ll need to get those to her somehow and with the city locked down, the only option is to somehow sneak in which means either digging a tunnel and risking another flood, or taking a small boat and trying row around to one of the open areas where the sea and the city have no barrier, but that would be incredibly risky given the heightened security. Using swimmers would probably be less risky, but not much better. <EOS>
<BOS> While some of the other guards are chuckling and Clyde’s buddy is telling him to cease his almost rape like threats, Clyde isn’t even paying attention anymore, he HATES your dismissive tone and all he’s feeling is disrespect to his authority. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay then, but first.” You say and whistle for your people to come out of hiding. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t know! I guess I was pissed at you okay?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Basically.” You retort. <EOS>
<BOS> You immediately drop Virgil and try to run out the back way of the Welcome Mat, but the militia already has that covered as well when several of them bust in the back door. <EOS>
<BOS> You continue your search, but it’s been awhile since you’ve been stomping about in the wilderness and it’s soon apparent that you’re not exactly prepared since you get turned around several times. <EOS>
<BOS> You move into a jog, enjoying the feel of ground under your feet. Just a few farspans more, and you will be by Ivani's side! <EOS>
<BOS> You continue on foot. It's only a couple farspans to the Grove, now, and you can almost taste the electricity in the air. Ivani, what remains of her, is close, and your journey is near its end. <EOS>
<BOS> The screaming subsides into heavy sobs. <EOS>
<BOS> It is your most valued possession, the original stories your wife once inscribed and gave to you as a wedding present. Many of the stories have faded to near illegibility - the ones you have read the most, for all tales fade in the world now that the muses have gone, even ones like these written before the Sacrifice or written on Remembrance paper or carved into stone. They might not vanish immediately like spoken tales, never to be told again, but they still are powerless to last forever. But to lose the memory of them - that is what terrifies you, and what has driven you to take this Pilgrimage. <EOS>
<BOS> “And you trust this pirate?” <EOS>
<BOS> “What? I don’t have the damn keys and we don’t have time to search all these fuckers.” Tanya exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> “A fucking year huh? Mr. Scars overestimates this favor I owe him. Ah, all right, what the hell, things are pretty peaceful right now I guess I can spare some. The Ebony Claw will make sure you’re under our general protection, but remember, you ARE NOT one of us. That means if you severely fuck up or get in the way of our business, all bets are fucking off. Got me, pretty boy?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Half an admission of defeat, but probably the best I'm going to ever hear from you. I'll take it." You say smiling. <EOS>
<BOS> “Also she wants to leave the village like there’s something more out there for her! There’s nothing that she needs outside the village that I can’t provide! I mean…” <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm a wandering Pilgrim," you say, leaving out your destination and profession. "I seek answers - why have there been no dreams since the Sacrifice of Salvation? Why do stories always fade? And why - I hesitate to bring this up, lest I alarm you - why does it seem something is happening to memory?" <EOS>
<BOS> “What makes you think he won’t get sabotaged again by either group? I mean the Ebony Claw might not have a direct presence here, but they’re still making some coin from us. Same is somewhat true of the Felians, though different reasons. They’re allies with the ECS, so they tend to help them and it isn’t like the Felian Temple here is our enemy even if they aren’t aligned or in any position to do anything in the first place.” <EOS>
<BOS> “SHIT! IT’S A BLOOD STALKER! RUN! RUN!” he shouts and takes off ahead of you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit…you’re paying for that asshole!” he utters as you’re still shaking your hand from the pain of punching him. <EOS>
<BOS> “From what I can tell they see us as the biggest threat to control over the city. The spy admitted it and I mean their previous actions over the past few months have proven that due to all their attacks. Not to mention the Syndicate is allied with the Temple of Fel which is a rival god, so it makes perfect sense to take out two enemies so closely linked. And I suppose perhaps maybe I am to blame as well. The cult of Neroth and I have sort of a history and it probably doesn’t help the Syndicate that they have a personal vendetta against me. I still get the odd cultist trying to assassinate me every now and then.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Where’s your goblin friends?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> You attempt to run out the door, but before you even reach it, your whole body spontaneously combusts into flames. You scream in agony as the fire completely engulfs your body. <EOS>
<BOS> “And here I was just getting used to walking through shitty water.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Besides the fact that he moves around a lot, we’ve tried several times and we can’t get close enough. He’s also got some sort of magical protection that deflects projectiles of any kind. I suppose if we had more people maybe we could try to overwhelm him, but those damn Joachimites…they do not go down easy. Some of them rival a Karnite priest in their stubbornness to die and I should know because I’ve had to fight several of each. Yes, they are definitely not the peace and love pacifists they once were. I guess perhaps the Neroth cultists that were plaguing the city years ago lit that spark of hate back in them.” <EOS>
<BOS> The day of the attack within the first hour you wait anxiously for a report. With any luck Marco’s crew will manage to make it off their ship before they’re all slaughtered. <EOS>
<BOS> "Zal, this really is the less messy solution. If we're getting out like you wanted us to, we can't go around committing a mass murder that could potentially get one or more of us killed in the process. I mean how fucked up would it be if I died or worse, YOU died during the hit? Camid left with a little over half of the Talons, we would have been outnumbered. Let those militia assholes waste their lives. Better them than us, and as I said before, especially you." You say caressing the side of Zal's face. <EOS>
<BOS> “And after I actually have the baby? Again, it’s not going to be a problem. Even if we’re in the middle of a gang war, I’ll strap the little bugger on my back and fight off potential assassins if I have to. My point is, I’m in this with you all the way. Motherhood isn’t going to change me drastically.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmm, yeah.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Indeed we wouldn’t have risked leaving our small town sir, but…well you see we are in love and our parents didn’t approve. We had no choice but to flee and get married elsewhere. Klyton was the closest and safest place.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Good. Oh, word of advice, don’t go flashin’ dat shooty around unless you’re gonna use it. The guards don’t take kindly to folks just carrying those things around.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, you KNEW and didn’t fucking tell us?!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure, put one foot in front of the other and start walking. What? Did you think we’d give you a horse for killing a single orc that you apparently lead near here in the first place? I got more important matters to care of. Out.” <EOS>
<BOS> At this point you slam Vera against the wall and put your hand to her mouth. <EOS>
<BOS> Honestly, you aren’t even sure how or if you’d ever be able to approach the subject with Tanya. As far as you know she’s always been pretty dedicated to the Guild even if she’s aloof to most of the members. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you a member of the Spider Fangs?” <EOS>
<BOS> “And all I have to do is escort your assistant?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Doesn’t seem like nothing considering you’re disobeying orders. It seems to me you’re trying to figure out a way to take out Reginald directly. That’s why you’ve been spying on his house for the past few days.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You have anything magical on you?” Heather asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, Mr. Flynt asked you a question!” one of Flynt’s friends snaps. <EOS>
<BOS> "Definitely bigger than I thought it would be. I'm just wondering how the hell did I not notice all the dirt being hauled out and dumped from this endeavor. Apparently I wasn't as observant as I thought I was. Just as well I guess, since this is a nice surprise." You remark walking around and looking upward. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I’ve been reading about a couple of brutal murders in the paper that are thought to be the work of Neroth cultists. Actually, maybe that explains Yinen’s disappearance. He always was a little nervous when it came to anything relating to Neroth. Maybe he took off like Warts did.” <EOS>
<BOS> You drop instantly. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 27 <EOS>
<BOS> “None I suppose, though I was just trying to figure out what might have been the motivator to throw your lot in with trusting this sorceress and her adepts. But if you say it was purely a practical and strategic move for the good of the League, then that’s good enough for me.” <EOS>
<BOS> The waiting period for the execution is happily a lot swifter and by the time you walk to the chopping block; you’re ready to accept your fate. <EOS>
<BOS> “If you had been smart, you would have left long before this even happened rather than forming the JRC in the first place. Shit, I didn’t even know you were here until that happened. Why’d you bother? You usually always played things smart. Did revenge cloud your judgment?” <EOS>
<BOS> While Madeline has talked about her past, she still hasn’t mentioned too much about her family. Not even about her father who you know she isn’t fond of, but you don’t know why exactly. She just mentions she has no contact with her father other than him paying for her education. It’s never a topic she wishes to discuss; she just wants to focus on the future with you, which is fine as far as you’re concerned. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shut the fuck up kid and get the hell out of the…SHIT!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well it would be nice, but I understand if you need to think on it. Hessla isn’t a safe place and knowing your father, I’m sure he wanted better for you and you grew up in a protected environment and are probably less familiar with handling folks with a more criminal mentality.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I can’t help my feelings towards you! Oh I don’t understand why you can’t just kill Camid so we can be together!” Madeline exclaims and then hugs you tightly and trying not to cry. <EOS>
<BOS> “What happened between you and Garrick after the meeting?” Tanya asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well they’re a bunch of savages, and I’d watch Warts if I were you. Nothing worse than a mildly intelligent savage with delusions of grandeur.” <EOS>
<BOS> You leave Wendy's house and return to your sewer headquarters. You're starting to wonder if you shouldn't have just bought your family's old inn in the first place. At least it would have been big enough for you to make your home in. <EOS>
<BOS> In your haste to try to get your bearings, you’re slightly less observant of the little things and unfortunately for you that results in worse than just being lost. <EOS>
<BOS> “Come in, come in, I was just finishing up my latest sermon. Have my faithful been providing an adequate job with your extra security? There haven’t been any issues have there?” Gloom asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s why I’m going to meet her. If she’s everything Camid claims then we’ll proceed. If not, I can have Camid flogged for wasting my time and we’ll go back to picking one your people.” <EOS>
<BOS> "WEAK MINDED FOOLS!" You can hear Rifiv's muffled shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m here. What’s going on and who is this?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “HEY! The two of you stop fucking conspiring over there! In fact the pair of you need to shut the fuck up and just go to sleep because tomorrow you’ll both be going before the judge and sentenced for your crimes! Enjoy your last night of freedom criminal scum!” <EOS>
<BOS> You explain everything you’ve learned about Peter Varsakken’s invasion, which immediately catches Heather’s attention. You don’t go into detail about sending one of your people to meet with Peter, but you do ask the direct question if she’s supporting Ludmilla. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the…first of all I’m sick of these rumors about me and her when it wasn’t even like that! Second of all, I just said ONCE that our capers might run smoother if you had a better array of talents rather than just relying on your looks.” <EOS>
<BOS> “In any case, you’re in luck. Your old room is available, but I’ll be needing some rent for it. Business is a little slow what with not many folks coming to visit the city as much now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck. Look, here.” You say and hand him a shitload of coins and even a few gems you had. <EOS>
<BOS> The Crown Prize is a massive ship, but well appointed. Mahoghany banisters line the corridors, and free food just sits out on random tables. Besides tipping the servant who cleans your cabin, you shouldn't have to spend any extra coin during the trip. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, Red Nose Rob." Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I remember you too, you fucking whore. You can join your…Urk!” KF says before you interrupt him by stabbing him in the back. <EOS>
<BOS> “That doesn’t prove anything.” <EOS>
<BOS> Teklis laughs again. <EOS>
<BOS> "An inventor, and a patch of land in need of a purpose - these will do nicely, thank you!" <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose not, but still I thought for sure they would pay you a visit after they found out, the League’s only remaining holdings were in Jicol and under new management.” <EOS>
<BOS> “By the gods! What have you done!? What have you DONE?!” your mother shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> “Trust me, I’m starting to think that was a better idea right now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You have no ship. Are you saving coin to buy one?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I love you too…don’t stop.” She replies, followed by a pleasured moan. <EOS>
<BOS> "Actually she would be a real criminal if she was helping us in this capacity. Good to know about the price. I'll keep her in mind." <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m going to go in and getting the room, you grab the supplies from the carriage.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, I wouldn’t jump to that conclusion, but at least you can take comfort in the fact that IF you ever fail me, I’m not going to have you stripped naked and sell your ass to pirates.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Come on Jake, get off…” Vaughn says attempting to move Jake off of you. <EOS>
<BOS> In the meantime, Vera also springs some extra news on you that you weren’t expecting. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re coming to grips with your uncovered memories, Heather is done with this whole thing. <EOS>
<BOS> “Stop! He’s dead!” Annah says. <EOS>
<BOS> “You don’t know that.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, you wouldn’t be my type, but you do look dapper in that suit.” Vaughn says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh? No, not really. Just dumping out some qweepa bones. We usually keep them in these boxes until we kill ‘em.” The boy says. <EOS>
<BOS> If Ardan has plans on killing you, he doesn’t seem like he’d be averse to doing it right here if need be. If you need to run, better that you’re not in an enclosed space to more easily get away. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora at this point turns to leave for real this time and there’s a part of you that wants to stop her, even though you think it might be more trouble than its worth. <EOS>
<BOS> “You heard me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Leadership suits you,” Seth whispers, too soft for the others to hear. “You would have made a fine commander in the king’s army.” <EOS>
<BOS> Huh. You guess your father DID manage to save Annah. You’d show more expression of being happy to hear that, but you know you can’t right now. <EOS>
<BOS> The room isn’t the same luxury you had back home, but it isn’t bad considering the price. Between this room and the recent bribe however, you realize you’re going to have to start getting to work fairly soon because your money is already starting to run low. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because…because I really do care about you.” You say suddenly. <EOS>
<BOS> “How the hell did you not know, if you got that far?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 29 <EOS>
<BOS> “Ow! Your room?” you say and begin blocking her attacks. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 24 <EOS>
<BOS> With things going well you continue with your life a little more relaxed. And while you’re coming back from the university one night… <EOS>
<BOS> “Right. This coming from the woman who is sponging off some other woman who is sponging off her parents. Look, you got your way of doing things, I got mine. I once again thank you for your help, but we’re not fucking so I don’t have to listen to this…whatever this is.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> The rope begins to shake signaling your turn. You take a deep breath and begin to climb up. Your new life was about to begin. <EOS>
<BOS> You rub your hands on your head. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, you’ve done enough already and I never even asked for it. I see now that I probably should have though. I believe we can do this ourselves, however if you still wish to help, I will not turn it down.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya, you could have told me this! Why didn’t you? I could have…” Garrick starts to say before he’s interrupted. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? You can’t seriously be considering hiring more hobs.” <EOS>
<BOS> Suddenly Zal speaks up. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, I know you! You’re that shithead we spoke to earlier this week about not working on our turf. What the fuck are you doing here?” one of them says recognizing you as well. <EOS>
<BOS> And much like spiders of the smaller variety, it injects a poison, which paralyzes you, but it doesn’t bother wrapping you up and save you for later. It’s hungry now and just decides to eat you alive right then and there. <EOS>
<BOS> “WHAT?! How the hell did that happen?!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> By the time the tomorrow night rolls around, you’re sort of glad to meet up with the other Guild member since you’re hoping it will clear your mind. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re looking around for stairs to the cellar, you hear some thumping coming from the upstairs. Things have been more or less silent so far, so this it cause to give you alarm. <EOS>
<BOS> “You ain’t seen her yet? She’s even fancier than you are right now. If it gets anymore highbrow here, we’re gonna hafta forge all dat gold and silver we got inta fancy eatin’ utensils.” <EOS>
<BOS> Eyeing Lorthander cautiously, Prince Ragar takes the steps to the altar. He holds his sword in front of him, searching for signs of deception, ready to strike if Lorthander proves enemy. <EOS>
<BOS> “You got a way with words Zal. Well okay, I suppose this stuff isn’t really top secret or anything.” <EOS>
<BOS> You sit down on the bed and lie back trying to process all this. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya” takes off the hood and white wig revealing her natural brown hair. Now that you’ve got a full look at her, you recognize her, even if the voice wasn’t immediately familiar. <EOS>
<BOS> "I weave my tales with random things - people, place, objects. I ask the audience to propose at least one element. In this way, I do not risk important stories being lost, and the potential for new tales is near infinite." <EOS>
<BOS> “Kenzer’s huh? I just got done telling someone that the Klyton hospital has better security then most jewelry stores and of course now you’re telling me you’re hitting the one exception. Place might as well be a bank. In fact a bank might be easier. Still, you got my attention so you might as well come inside and tell me of this mad plan.” <EOS>
<BOS> “NO Clyde! STOP! Shit! Get Clyde off of him!” Clyde’s buddy shouts to everyone, as Clyde is kicking your head in. <EOS>
<BOS> “Can’t! My leg’s all twisted! You’ll have to carry me!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey I meant to ask you before you made your suggestion last night, as I was coming home yesterday, someone told me they thought they saw you coming out of my home with Ardan earlier.” Keira remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ll take that as a no. Do you know how to sail?” <EOS>
<BOS> You maintain a respectful attitude and listen to his lecture, until your Claw “liaison” comes to find you. <EOS>
<BOS> And you do, but no longer alive. You find the pair of them not far apart from each other. Their broken bodies are partially covered by several large stones, which you assume killed them instantly. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I’m coming with you. I really don’t want any trouble. When we get to Keira, you’ll see that nothing is going on.” You say and raise your hands up. <EOS>
<BOS> Before you can beg, fight back or attempt to talk your way out of this, Rook removes his eyepatch revealing a black gem in his eye socket. A solid black beam of dark energy emits from it and hits you in your head. <EOS>
<BOS> “I know that, I just mean…I thought you couldn’t get pregnant! Something about your lady innards being barren.” <EOS>
<BOS> As you walk to Vaughn's place you pass a couple of patrolling guards. You still remember when you first came to this city it still wasn't quite as restrictive as it is now. You guess it's good you got out of the life when you did. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya doesn’t answer you, but instead just gives a huffing growl. <EOS>
<BOS> After helping yourself to some of the gold, you walk out of the office and through the rest of building until you get to the courtyard where several of junkies are still lingering about despite all the gunshots. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora at first is shocked that you would say this to her, but then she chuckles. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, I’m not sure if this Reginald is ally material.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Take me there.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, you have to go right? I mean it’s the Baroness.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well why don’t we do that?” <EOS>
<BOS> “But what about me?! Don’t you think I’ll feel really bad about killing you?!” <EOS>
<BOS> Wasting no time, you leap halfway across Tom’s desk in an effort to stop him from pulling out a pistol. You were correct as you manage to grab his hand in the drawer and indeed see it grabbing a pistol. <EOS>
<BOS> You turn and see three people walking in the place, probably the travellers that you saw earlier. The speaker (and presumably leader of the group) is a man dressed in leather armor with a sword by his side. His two companions are dressed in a similar manner. <EOS>
<BOS> “And so am I. So now what? You brought me here to potentially join your little organization, but so far I’m not really impressed with the organization part. I thought you guys were supposed to be infamous or something.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Zapi Zap Zap!” it says, waving its little arms. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah, don’t flatter yourself. I just want a quick tumble and I don’t feel like finding myself some rent boy or dealing with Jake’s usual asshole behavior right now. Plus, you’re young and a lot less repulsive…hey are you a virgin?” Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well here I was worrying that my infernal influence was slowly turning you into my slave or something, but obviously I don’t have that much influence if you’re able to keep a pretty big secret like that from me.” <EOS>
<BOS> You suppose you could always ask him again later when he’s feeling less feisty. He will have likely forgotten all about your so-called insult later, of course he probably will have forgotten about the guy looking for you too. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, the doctor hired me. How long have I been asleep?” <EOS>
<BOS> “So if I go to talk with them, at best they’ll probably ignore me, at worst they’ll turn me into ash.” <EOS>
<BOS> The closer you get to the area of Dorna’s temple, the less people you see around in general. The force field that shimmers in and out of existence and surrounds the temple has certainly done its job in keeping everyone away. <EOS>
<BOS> You wait outside for a long time and eventually Tom exits the building. He says to you that you’ll speak when you get back to headquarters. You walk back in silence. <EOS>
<BOS> Elder Flynn motions you to take a seat and you do so before explaining “your tale” as it were. <EOS>
<BOS> “I can see that logic, but I still have concerns if allying with religious fanatics that participate in human sacrifice is a good idea. I mean hell, I’d rather temporarily ally with the Ebony Claw against the cultists at this point…” <EOS>
<BOS> The chipper voice is familiar and now when you get a good look at the figure so is the face, even if it is partially disfigured now on one side. The man places a small box on the table with a hand that has two missing fingers. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t ask, in fact after this is all over I might not even have one anymore. Anyway, let’s get on with this.” <EOS>
<BOS> So it's with a slight reluctance that you once again take Mr. Reynolds up on his offer... <EOS>
<BOS> “Well it’s true you asshole! You were my first love, I had fun with you! And I thought you felt the same! I figured the best way to get over you was to just do it, but you still lingered in my mind every once in awhile. THEN you suddenly show up at the university and stir all my shit up again! I go some nights feeling sick thinking about what went so wrong that caused us to break up.” Annah says getting emotional. <EOS>
<BOS> Outside the cave, the world darkens - the storm bringing on an early evening. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, I know this is a big change, but sometimes when big changes present themselves, your best bet is to embrace them. I know I haven’t known you long and maybe I’m over stepping a boundary here, but I think you’re meant for things outside of this simple village.” <EOS>
<BOS> Water fills your lungs, you struggle to breathe, death soon comes and so do you as the "hooked" mermaid at least has the decency to finish you off before everything goes black. <EOS>
<BOS> Your sister goes first and briefly goes into some of the places she's been. She says she actually passed through Holgard at one point, but apparently you must have just missed each other at the Baroness’ party! Apparently she was invited there by some aristocrat and was even playing somewhere in the palace, but left as soon as everyone got all grabby and she started feeling really weird. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh? Never known you two to talk. What did she say exactly?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m going to enter the Unarmed Combat competition,” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tan…(cough) (ack)” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm. Didn’t know that. Then again you lot are always insular so I just assumed you were being bookworms as usual and never leaving your temple. I’m surprised you told me that your temple isn’t as strong as it once was. Still, I would have thought the Felians would at least have knowledge of this and been all over it, but then they’re hardly the order they once were too.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, Yag certainly threw a seven for you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I will! Thank you for this boss!” Vera beams. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck, right. Hold on.” <EOS>
<BOS> What Peter may or may not do in the future is something you’ll just have to face then, but right now it’s probably best to make sure Ludmilla is still in power after all this. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m sure that’s where she is. Goodbye and again I’m glad you came. I’m just sorry we didn’t get a chance to talk more, but you know what? We should meet again sometime. Just us two. Talk about life and shit.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Vaughn's militia man. Got to admit, that's not a bad plan. Just...I dunno. Seems weird ratting them out like that to solve the issue." Zal remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> As you move as quickly as you can with a twisted ankle and sore feet, you spy out the corner of your eye, the crown laying in the grass by some bushes. Seeing as this is what got you into this in the first place, you figure you might as well retrieve it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Great, I’ll have to remember to go get my meat from elsewhere for the next month, because I know what the cheapskate owner’s going to do. Though I suppose things are tough all over…if you could, drag those bodies that ARE outside my shop in here. I’ll knock off a few coins for the book.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Hmm, I dunno. I still think my background isn't going to mesh well. I'm not really a slash and burn type. I'm more of a pick a lock and sneak out in the middle of the night kind of guy." <EOS>
<BOS> “What happened?” <EOS>
<BOS> “So, what a fine lad like you doing on this road by himself? Don’t you know there are bandits and worse about?” the merchant asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t need to kill you all, I’m just gonna kill you and I don’t need hobs to do my work.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck it, give me that egg.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> This of course isn’t appreciated and you soon receive another kick. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re not out of the fight yet though and you’ve been through two city upheavals already, you can easily survive a third as long as you’re smart about all this. You ran away from home once before, you’re not doing it again, especially not now when you’ve built a life here. Might not be ideal to most, but it’s yours. <EOS>
<BOS> "Where you see strength and beauty, I see weakness and pride. Now I have what they sought, but I have no use for these baubles." <EOS>
<BOS> “Well what does she do?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I’m afraid something is going to have to be done about him. You can’t just have a divided organization with half of it’s members calling themselves something else and primarily pledging allegiance to another leader.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Now Sneaks is totally confused. <EOS>
<BOS> “Clueless idiot. Vera’s been in cahoots with the Syndicate for a long time now. She was also in on the whole invasion. If anything I’m saving you time because if you got to Jicol, she would have only turned your ass in to the Syndicate herself.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So…are you coming with me?” you ask Zalmora. <EOS>
<BOS> “Just thinking about something.” You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, glad you listened, it got a little closer than I thought it would, but it’s all worked out now.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> You suddenly hear the sounds of multiple footsteps heading your direction and you immediately find an alcove to hide in and pull out your pistol. Warts of course crowds your hiding spot, you just hope the smell of the sewers masks his own odor from whoever is approaching. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hold on, hold on, stop.” You say one more time gently pushing her head away. <EOS>
<BOS> "Shit...my leg...my fucking leg...Vaughn I might need you to...Vaughn?" You say and slowly move yourself off of him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Can’t say as I blame them, I’ve been on the verge of puking since we entered your secret tunnel which you neglected to mention was actually a foul forgotten sewer drain entrance.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s my understanding that the Delantium Kingdom hasn’t exactly been in a big hurry to retake this place. I mean it’s been decades hasn’t it?” <EOS>
<BOS> She busies herself cleaning for a few minutes, also taking your cup before you have finished it, then exits through one of the only two doors in the cabin. You hope the other leads to a washroom. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually your body hangs limp and the Bloody Talons drop you to the ground. Then with a final killing blow, one of them jams the dagger into the back of your neck and leave your bloody body to be gnawed on by the alley rats until morning. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah! He visited his sister too and decided he liked the city so much that he took it in the name of the Delantium Kingdom!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well shit…” <EOS>
<BOS> They were coming. Seth ducks from an arrow fired towards his head. How did they know we were coming? His twin blades dance in unison, taking apart the feeble defense of the young-faced boy in front of him. One blade lands in the boy's stomach and the other finishes the job at his neck. <EOS>
<BOS> “There you go again putting me down! I don’t see you complaining about my talents when you’re having your five minutes of fun…” <EOS>
<BOS> You run past the crowds in the Laughing Devil which are cheering some bard on stage and go outside where you run into three tattooed androgynous looking elves with wild colored hair carrying instruments and exiting a nearby carriage. You’re guessing that this is Nature’s Revenge. <EOS>
<BOS> You make your way back to the inn where you’re supposed to be getting some rest like Tanya suggested, but after your encounter with Rook, you’re more wound up than ever. Eventually you do fall asleep and by the time you wake up, it’s night and you’re rushing to go meet Tanya. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well yeah boss, da whole cities goin’ ta shit again.” <EOS>
<BOS> You reach into your small bag still on your person and check to see if you’ve still got your water skin or food since you’re getting a little hungry and thirsty <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, when your agent came to the university asking questions and I caught wind of it, I was intrigued and then when I found out a little bit more of your situation in the letter I was even more interested. So hence why I’m here to meet you first. We can actually get started right away as long we aren’t going to be disturbed.” <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora nods at your words. <EOS>
<BOS> “Which now I guess means the next step is yours heartbreaker.” <EOS>
<BOS> Other footsteps run off, retreating from your position and you’re about to do the same when you suddenly feel a strong grip on your wrist and slamming your hand against the wall causing you to drop your pistol. You swing at your assailant, who you now can see is Percy, but your punch is blocked and you’re knocked to the floor. <EOS>
<BOS> “Jenny might come from money, but she’s a bit of a hording cheapskate, somewhat like you in that regard. As I said, under different circumstances, you’d probably get along with her.” Annah say with a chuckle. <EOS>
<BOS> You look and you see Tanya sitting on the ground with her knees tucked in and her head buried in her arms. <EOS>
<BOS> The mayor just looks at you with a continued defiance until a couple of your people bring a woman in her late middle age to you. She probably was prettier back when she was younger. Now the mayor’s eye betray him slightly as a glint of concern crosses his face before returning to defiance. <EOS>
<BOS> For a long time after your parting of ways with Tanya you didn’t even show much interest in other women. Indeed you felt a great loss as if she died and you were in mourning. <EOS>
<BOS> “Trust me. You came here because I could help you solve your problem. Maybe not the way you thought, but the job WILL get done. I promise.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m going to gore you with them if you don’t start taking this seriously! I mean I just killed Garrick and I don’t even feel that bad about it. I mean shouldn’t I feel something?” <EOS>
<BOS> You recognize it immediately; it’s the pet Zorch Rat of your village rival Ember. Ember and you have always been in competition with each other over one thing or another. Does this mean Ember is here at the tower? <EOS>
<BOS> Not that you have any loyalty to Warts and he’s been pretty snarky towards you in general, but he’s still your guide and if you don’t want to get lost… <EOS>
<BOS> “You really don’t judge do you?” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> Your mid to lower half is now covered in a mixture of blood and shit causing you to recoil in horror and disgust. You promptly scramble away from Vera and puke your own guts out, though fortunately in your case it isn’t blood. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay. Then what would make me worthy…in your eyes?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Driven to find something more, but unsure what, the princess took some clothes from the garden shed and disguised herself as a beekeeper one day. But before she could exit the gardens, she was seen, and brought along with the other beekeepers to the hives. There she tended to the bees, along with the other workers, and witnessed how content they were. Though they did not play, they were lively. Though they didn't dine on cream, their food was sweet. What they desired they worked towards, together, and the community grew richer. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah’s eyes widen. <EOS>
<BOS> Daylight. The rising sun peers over surrounding hills, sending its golden rays long on the green hilltops. You sit, cross-legged, waiting for the light to appear. Eventually, it rises high enough for the rays to land on your face, sending its warmth throughout your body. Off in the distance, a crow squawks, disturbed by another animal. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh yes of course! We’re the worshippers of Dorna! Goddess of not just magic but of knowledge! We try to make it a point of knowing everything and everyone that might be important for one never knows when the knowledge may come in handy.” <EOS>
<BOS> “The fuck you mean by that? I’m in no mood for your attitude today. I don’t even know why the hell you were even allowed in our organization after what you’ve done. You put several of my friends in the ground you fucker!” <EOS>
<BOS> Marco takes his leave and you begin to mentally make preparations of how you’re going to have to prepare your defenses. You figure you’ll have a few months before the Syndicate realizes something has happened to their people and get their shit together to send a force after you. <EOS>
<BOS> A couple days pass and that other business finally comes to pass and this is what you’ve been more concerned about. <EOS>
<BOS> “I know, just trying to help.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm. Is that supposed to mean something?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Dunno, I figured you’d hide some place familiar. This is the area where we first did it so I took a chance.” Annah says. <EOS>
<BOS> When you left a year ago, you figured it would be a couple months maybe. You didn't know how far away all these places you're raiding were going to be. <EOS>
<BOS> She’s of course on the rooftop where you were yesterday. <EOS>
<BOS> “Nobody has thought to look into this?” <EOS>
<BOS> “The medicine! What do I need exactly to cure my fucking dick?” <EOS>
<BOS> You can't go back to those "good old days" even though you might wish to. Really, the good old days were long over the day you got chased out of Teckleville, and perhaps they were over even before that when your sister left. You hope she's doing well. <EOS>
<BOS> “That it? Figured we’d go around a third time.” Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright! Alright! Just stop! We’ll build a damn fire. I think I got a tinderbox, never used it though since I didn’t exactly spend nights out in the wilderness, so you’re going to have to bear with me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s a possibility I considered long before you ever showed up. However, this isn’t business. This is personal.” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the fuc…shit!” <EOS>
<BOS> Then you see her fly in. <EOS>
<BOS> Balen meets you there, about four hours after you first arrived in Aselthorne. "You should be safe enough, now," he says over a pint you bought him, "they didn't even pin the spare camel as yours. But you should move on." <EOS>
<BOS> And then it hits you. You can’t even believe it. You recognize this man. Or at least you recognize his facial features and voice. The beard was throwing you before, but there can be no mistake. <EOS>
<BOS> You figure with as good of terms you’re on with her, by the time your reach Galpatolis the pair of you should have already consummated your relationship. A little on the optimistic side perhaps, but you really need to seal this deal because it’s not really your life you’re worried about anymore, it’s your entire lineage. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, yeah…look I don’t have much, but you can have what I…” you start to say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Nothing else, I swear!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hello sir. Your trip was without trouble I trust?” she asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Better one than you obviously, you can’t even pick the easy lock on your cage.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Nope. Not a peep from them. Guess they just don’t care about the League since it’s so small and not really a threat to them.” <EOS>
<BOS> With this new order Vaughn is of course totally compliant as usual and takes his leave. <EOS>
<BOS> Feeling in danger you immediately start firing at the students. A couple of them go down, cuasing the rest to scatter a bit and a few magic bolts go wild in your direction missing you. <EOS>
<BOS> When you get to the Cozy Krak Inn, you see a large decorated building, which wouldn’t be out of place in the richer areas of Klyton. It’s actually a little more creative looking since it has a whole sea theme complete with some wall murals of sailors battling a giant squid and the inn sign also being in the shape of a squid. <EOS>
<BOS> “So I take it you’re the head of the Ebony Claw?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well what about the other stuff?” <EOS>
<BOS> “He’s barely that, and if he does come in here, he can just step right back out, because he pissed me off recently anyway. I don’t want to talk about that though. Besides, nothing is happening between us anyway. I don’t just become involved with strange men I find in the wilderness, so let’s get you fixed up.” <EOS>
<BOS> The proprietor is a portly, balding man, but still younger than yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya doesn’t even address what you said she instead turns her attention back to Garrick. <EOS>
<BOS> "And in order to hire THAT guy again, I'm going to have to deal with Mr. Fucking Reynolds and who knows what damn price he's going to ask for." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Next to the hooded elder stands a man dressed in an armored dark red robe.The crimson robe is reinforced with light plate in several key areas. A sizeable, yet nimble, breastplate is attached to his front and back torso. His shoulders are protected by layered pieces of metal. There doesn’t appear to be any armor from his waist-down, with movement prioritized over raw protection. Two short swords hang on his back. Brother Samuel stands near the two. He notices your stare, and gives a friendly wink. <EOS>
<BOS> Yinen must have known the way out since the door is already open, or rather the hidden bookshelf door that was hiding the stairs to the cellar. From here, you both make your way out the house (And again, find the door already open) <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh sure, that’s why I had to help you last week distracting those idiots you were trying to pick pocket.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Never considered myself a warrior before, but I suppose I’ll take it as a compliment.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So...the Grand Melee is coming up. Do you know which event you’re entering?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, last year towards the end of it, before the Inquisitor was finally brought down by Ludmilla’s troops. I only heard about my parents a few months after everything had died down. I was a little pre-occupied with something else at the time, but I rushed back here to this accursed city as soon as possible to take care of various affairs.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, well you lot go down there and end it today then. Isn’t that why you’re here? I never said I was going to stand in your way.” <EOS>
<BOS> “A few weeks now.” Tanya remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t even start, where the hell is Vera, she’s the one that made a bigger deal of all this?” <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile, you still have to go stab the Felians in the back though you’re sort of wondering about still going through with that now what you’ve heard about Heather cozying up to the Baroness. <EOS>
<BOS> There once lived a stableman who loved to invent things. Rom was barely out of boyhood, a mere 21 years of age, and had three older brothers who also tended horses. One day, their mistress called all four of them together, and challenged them thus: <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, I know how you feel about this and back in Holgard it didn’t matter as much since it was a bigger city with more options, but here? We’re in a perfect position to take advantage of the thriving slave trade in this area.” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Suddenly Marco comes walking back in. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh sure, we understand. We’re going to be in Jicol for awhile so we can sort out details then. Honestly, I’d prefer to stay here in Nightfall closer to the temple, but Toz here is a little on the paranoid side and doesn’t wish to sleep in the heart of… let’s just say, an unproven ally’s home, but I’m sure that will change soon! Besides, Fel’s shadow is everywhere after all and his dark blessing is with his faithful always.” Percy remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “You a tour guide for Holgard now too? Well, I suppose after all the shit that happened during the invasion resulted in a lot of damage and rebuilding, so I’m almost betting my favorite tavern isn’t even standing anymore.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, so you’ve said. However, your island is becoming very popular in terms of the slave trade. It’s just one of the big reason why Hessla is so angry with you. The Syndicate has never relied on the slave trade as our main source of income, indeed for whatever reason it’s just never been a cornerstone. One of the few things we’re just dabblers in. We’re trying again however, and while Hessla in the past has always been a stubborn partner in such thing in the past, we’re hoping the League’s rising status in this part of the world will be more open in such matters.” <EOS>
<BOS> You return to Ren and hand him a gold coin for a room to which he just grunts and hands you a key. <EOS>
<BOS> Fights are pretty common, though they aren't necessarily always to the death like you'd expect. Just a lot of disagreement and drinking make for a rowdy town. So far you've avoided pissing anyone off and kept a low profile. You aren't sure if you're actually going to stay here long or not, but so far it's better than Klyton. <EOS>
<BOS> Well no point in arguing with her when she’s like this… <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmm, maybe I should go with him and try to meet with Peter. Feel him out and see if there is any potential there.” <EOS>
<BOS> You manage to see the glint of a blade in the darkness and then Percy drops hi knees in your stomach, knocking the air out of you and attempts to stab you. He’s quick, but despite your state of gasping for air you’re just quick enough to grab ahold of the knife-wielding arm from stabbing you in the face, though it’s now just inches from it. You attempt to roll and kick, but all of Percy’s weight is on you. <EOS>
<BOS> She’d want you to move on not give up and that’s what you’ll try to do. <EOS>
<BOS> This is enough time to distract Graham and allowing you to act. <EOS>
<BOS> You just sigh thinking that this was going so well too. <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose I did. I guess I always have taken the initiative in our relationship.” <EOS>
<BOS> You look over to your left and see Scully jump over the side of the ship. This is soon followed by the Captain coming out of his quarters. <EOS>
<BOS> "Did we really need another one?" Zal asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “There you are boss! We’ve been looking all over for ya!” one of them remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Even if he is a childhood friend of your father, you just don’t trust Tom enough to set him free. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck you!” Tom shouts, but instead of struggling for the pistol he instead grabs a sharp quill off his desk and stabs you deep in the eye with it. <EOS>
<BOS> “And maybe you need to learn your limitations.” she exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> You definitely didn’t sign up for this…however given what you’ve seen here, you’d be quite the heartless dick if you just left her here to this horrible fate. <EOS>
<BOS> “Now that’s not true. I told Vaughn to tell you to…” <EOS>
<BOS> You try to beg for her to listen one last time. <EOS>
<BOS> "Can we help at all?" The woman in pink asks. <EOS>
<BOS> She has truly become a very bitter woman. You’re a little concerned about her talking so freely killing the baroness. Not really because you have some great love of serving the baroness, but more the fact that such talk and your knowledge of it without doing anything about it could potentially get you in trouble if it somehow got overheard by someone else. Not to mention her general more miserable attitude nowadays puts you on less comfortable footing with her. Nothing worse than a cranky wizard. <EOS>
<BOS> You grimace a bit, thinking that this plan of yours probably didn’t work, but apparently Fel indulged the boy anyway explaining the benefits of such a thing, oddly he also explained the benefits of staying here too. Then he told Kol that if he was really serious, he should contact a well dressed man with a thin mustache and he will be able to get him off the island before anyone figures it out since he knows what to do already. <EOS>
<BOS> “So how is the halfbreed anyway?” <EOS>
<BOS> Now, he’s given himself a nickname, gone on to call his group the Bloody Smiles and doesn’t report back to Tom for months. When he does, he just sends one of the newer Talons with some goods and loot. While Tom as usual is taking a laid back approach to this figuring as long as he’s still sending shit back then everything is good, you question whether Jake is even thinking about the Talons anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh don’t worry. It’s just me and I’m not here to harm you. I doubt if I would be in any condition to do so anymore even with my magic now. Couldn’t even sneak up on you.” The man says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well since I know your name and reputation mean a lot to you, I’m going to go ahead and believe you, so how much is all this going to cost?” <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re getting undressed, Heather briefly says that she’d like to be on top during all this. You see no reason to disagree since it’s all going to get the job done and you figure maybe it eases her mind that she at least is going to have some “control” over the situation. (Or maybe she’s just more comfortable that way) <EOS>
<BOS> The sheriff is so flustered he can’t even be bothered to yell at you anymore. He just says you’re going to get yours and soon before leaving. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fair enough, I can respect that, but let me ask you this…are you REALLY willing to go through hell for her son? Now I want you to think VERY carefully before answering. Because IF you are willing to go all in on proving how much you actually do love my daughter, then I need that answer now.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Your guy would be very expensive and I'm trying to keep the costs down as much as I can. If it looks like things are going to shit, well then I'll consider your guy again." <EOS>
<BOS> You head straight to Yinen who assumes you’re to meet him for business as usual. <EOS>
<BOS> “They didn’t just dig a tunnel into the Yellow Devil Den. They’ve dug tunnels all over the sewers. Mostly under them. Made it easier for them to get around without having to walk about in the actual sewers. They may have also dug some tunnels near your old head quarters…you know, you look very peaceful when you sleep…” Madeline says looking directly at you. <EOS>
<BOS> “What madness is this?” you hear Seth’s voice speak. <EOS>
<BOS> “In simple terms basically, but they’re much more than that. They’re actually much more intelligent than the average rat. They aren’t even native to the continent, but a lot of them over the years have undoubtedly snuck aboard Hessla pirate ships and now they’re slowly starting to gain a foothold as a pest on the coast. One can only imagine how far they will have spread in another ten years.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It was a risk, I suppose. Then again they might have fucked with us anyway. At least now we’re a little stronger. Speaking of which, maybe we should get some of Gloom’s people here tonight as extra security until this visit is over. Might as well put that alliance we have to good use.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, seeing as my students held their own against a trained diabolist I’d hope they’d be able to handle some mundane orcs.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I’ll be waiting then.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I see. I did not know that such a meeting had been arranged.” The man says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Little late for that.” You reply reloading your pistol. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re telling them to shut the hell up and focus, you notice that Tom is getting something out of his desk. It’s probably going to be a flintlock pistol. <EOS>
<BOS> Still there are times when you wonder "what if" on certain events that you experienced during your life. You often keep such scenarios to yourself and quickly dismiss them however since in the scheme of things you have a good life and you worry that you might con yourself into believing that you missed out on some grand adventure. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well, I guess we better make sure our aim is true shouldn't we then? Look, if this is going to be a concern, we could always go get some of those repeating crossbows. They cost a damn fortune, but..." <EOS>
<BOS> When I reflect upon my childhood, mixed emotions rise. On one hand, I appreciate the strict devotion of the monks. They knew who they were, which is more than could be said for the average person. On the other hand, a sinister, underlying ideology tainted their religion; the monks would only accept infants without any worldly or familial experience. <EOS>
<BOS> "You see..." the man begins again, "there isn't any other choice. It isn't your fault, not your fault - the academy has been forced into this!" He sighs, the others nodding. "The remains of the muses are feeding off the stories you and others tell to stay alive." <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m guessing you’re just looking on me with distain of how weak of a human I am right about now.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> As the graduates are called on stage, your mind begins to get foggy and your lids get even heavier. You manage to just barely see Madeline accept her diploma before everything goes black. <EOS>
<BOS> “Decided to lay low huh? Looks more like you lot stayed down here, had a party, got liquored up and forgot about me!” Tom remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> The next day you head to the Temple of Fel. Several Felians don’t even seem to be bothered by your intrusion, which would be a much different story if Shade or his predecessors were running things. <EOS>
<BOS> "First of all, you don't know shit about his glory, so don't think to say shit to me about it. Second of all, some of that is going to his church so at least some good can come out of this wickedness." <EOS>
<BOS> You shake your head no. The mage looks disappointed, but shrugs after a moment. "Your loss, I suppose." <EOS>
<BOS> “Nothing, but I have no idea if that thing strips magic ability permanently or what. For all I know Flynn is setting us all up.” <EOS>
<BOS> Mr. Reynolds is giving off an aura that puts you completely on the edge terror. This isn’t just a normal threat. You’re seeing something new. Something less human, less mortal even. A faint scent also hits your nose, it’s brimstone. <EOS>
<BOS> “No. No I suppose I wouldn’t. But…I’m sure you wouldn’t really want us as enemies.” Heather says, <EOS>
<BOS> You see his face darken, even more than the surrounding monks who were off to battle. <EOS>
<BOS> The second thing you can think of is what the sergeant said. Something about the Ebony Claw Syndicate. You can make an educated guess that Flynt and his friends were part of this organization. Maybe if you told them everything that transpired at the inn, they would let you go. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t want to think about it and make haste out of this “inn.” Even when you killed Klint there was at least some justification, but you’re seriously wondering what the hell you just allowed to happen. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait a minute. What do you mean you sent them away when they told you were coming? How did they even know, we haven’t seen any of them.” Zal asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait a second, you’re making a lot of assumptions here. I haven’t agreed to this little plan of yours and I’m not sure what makes you think that I’m going to.” Zamed remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Just wondering if you really think you're going to be getting away with pilfering things forever in this town." He says. <EOS>
<BOS> “We’ll sleep on the ground, but we’re not starting a damn fire! Last thing we need to attract possible attention of Teckleville locals looking for me, or monsters or bandits…you know the ones that apparently just love to rape you in every scenario? If you’re cold, well you’ll just have to be satisfied with my body heat and cuddle up against me.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, well if it keeps you...I mean us safe, it's a good investment." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, as I told your wife before, I came from a large family and my one of my younger brothers became a Felian priest. Oscar displayed similar signs of having shadow magic abilities, as he grew older. Bit more of a late bloomer than your son though, but they were still present. He of course went to the temple in Holgard, where they started training him immediately, but I guess he was really showing some talent because he ended up getting transferred to the main temple in the Delantium Kingdom. Haven’t really spoken to him since, but I always figured that didn’t hurt my own standing in the ECS at the time seeing as the two organizations were allies.” <EOS>
<BOS> “A tree? I’m not sleeping in a tree! It sounds uncomfortable and I could fall out and break my neck!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well stop talking lover and just do it…ulp…yeah…just like that…” <EOS>
<BOS> To the north, the nightingale flew on, past the borders of the kingdom. As it grew dark and he grew weary, he alighted on the branches of a frozen tree to rest. Here he sang, whistling and crooning to the last rays of the setting sun. It is said that his music thawed the heart of Willow, Muse of Tragedy, and she gave him the warmth needed to complete his final song. <EOS>
<BOS> “Guess we’ll find out together. In the meantime, clean this place up and sell off whatever remaining slaves you have. If we do get back into that business, it’ll have to be done elsewhere. In any case, expect me and a bunch of others to be moving in here by the weekend. I suggest you take second best room you can. That’s it for now, but before I go, I need to take something first.” <EOS>
<BOS> “That sounds good.” <EOS>
<BOS> The entire temple to on alert anyway, so you should be getting reinforcements soon. While your ring might not seem like it’s helping, you’re actually moving at your own speed rather than suffering from whatever slow effects that were cast. <EOS>
<BOS> You open the door and immediately you see a familiar face staring at you and before you can do anything a blade strikes quickly across your throat. You manage to raise your pistol before Percy easily grabs it from your hand as you fall to the floor choking on your own blood. <EOS>
<BOS> With as much force as you can muster, you punch Lou in the side of the face while his attention is divided and take off running. This is soon followed by shouts calling for you to be stopped. <EOS>
<BOS> “I mean just to be really sure I actually saw a physician in Jicol and he pretty much confirmed it.” <EOS>
<BOS> Yep, their ranks definitely need to be whittled down severely. You’re just hoping the Dornans will help. That’s what you’re most concerned about, because if you don’t get their help in some meaningful way, you know full well you’ll be taking some losses if it turns into a straight up fight with the Joachimites. <EOS>
<BOS> "Even better. Been fucking dwarves. Grahk Kazek is the one that comes to mind." <EOS>
<BOS> “Us? No. I don’t see why they would. Why do you ask?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well done, kid. Glad you’re on our side.” <EOS>
<BOS> Flameflower grabs the pack from Lou and looks inside with a nod. <EOS>
<BOS> “I should cut yer tongue out for saying such lies, ya pointy eared boy lover!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah. Depends on your viewpoint I suppose. I know you’re the one that so rudely broke into my home and stole that girl years ago. We were a little pre-occupied in nabbing you before and you seem to be skilled enough to fight off our recent attempts. However when you walked in here of your own accord, and with that infernal spawn…well that almost makes up for all the years you were able to go on breathing.” <EOS>
<BOS> Changing the subject you ask, “How’d you get so good with your forms?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, that makes me feel even better. You got it from one of his lessers. To be honest, IF this IS indeed the powerful item you believe it to be, I’m a little leery that you’re so freely giving it to me, rather than keeping it for yourself.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What? Then where the hell am I supposed to be?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t…I didn’t mean…” is all he stutters. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well, I’m sure you’ll get by. Bye Vaughn.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes they’re fine…wait. You know about our new brother don’t you?” <EOS>
<BOS> Not too silly though since despite the deplorable state the Crimson Talons are in, you sort of wonder about the potential. Before you though maybe if you joined such an organization, you’d probably be considered just another low ranking flunky. However through barely any effort on your part, you may have just secured a high ranking position in the organization by helping out the new leader of it. You think if you joined and made a go of it, you’d at least have a lot of input. Who knows, maybe the organization will get back on its feet. If it did, you’d be even better off. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Vera starts unbuttoning her shirt and unsuccessfully attempting to walk seductively towards you and stumbling in the process. It’s pretty embarrassing. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, I know how YOU really want to celebrate…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah, there you are, if you two can get undressed and get in that circle, you can commence with the consummation.” Flynn says. <EOS>
<BOS> In the keep’s courtyard, rows of soldiers are lined up in perfect unison. At your presence, they drop to their knee as one. Dead men from the siege line the courtyard walls, creating a second inner wall built from mangled bodies and fallen soldiers. It’s then that you notice the soldiers in line are both from your army and the defending Imperial force. A subtle, raven-colored mark appears above their eyebrow, the mark of the Unbroken. <EOS>
<BOS> You quickly run to the now ownerless horse and clumsily get on. You’re a bit vulnerable for a few seconds, but fortunately the bandits seem to now think you’re on their side and don’t focus on you (and the remaining mercs have their hands full) <EOS>
<BOS> “Boring huh? I suppose stability would be a little dull to some, still there are benefits. So is that why you’re going around stealing and killing people? Running away from your boring small town and heading to the big city? Is this your form of rebellion?” <EOS>
<BOS> Sometimes you startle and launch into a tale of daring, or tragedy, or woe. Other times, you stare for hours into the heavens, as if hoping to see something beyond the stars. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, glad someone does, because nobody in Teckleville certainly did at the time, except for maybe for me and my sister. Okay, I guess there’s more than a few stories I haven’t told yet…” <EOS>
<BOS> The rest of the caravan ride passes with relative ease, minus a sunburn which took a few days to heal, and you even make a bit more coins drumming up rare shades of red like cerise and carmine, and telling stories to your caravan mates. Even if your legs are sore, it's an enjoyable way to travel. You check with the caravan master, and he assures you that if you should ever come back this way, you'll be welcome in the Imperial Caravan. <EOS>
<BOS> “You giving me lip boy? I’m asking the questions here! We don’t need anymore scum like you in this city!” the guard says and pushes you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. They think I’m some big dealer and part of the Ebony Claw Syndicate too, but I’m not either of those things.” <EOS>
<BOS> “In a manner of speaking,” the wisp replies. “Approach the middle pedestal.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” <EOS>
<BOS> Also unlike Holgard there are a lot more carriages not only going in and out of the city, but also within it. Public transportation was never a high priority in Holgard for various reasons, you’re wondering though if it should start. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah! A filthy greenskin! Probably a scout! Kill him!” one of the bandits shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, you’re in a big city now. All you have to do now is figure out how to thrive here. <EOS>
<BOS> “In fact Mr. Dream said he wouldn’t have known if you hadn’t caved in to take a hit of Blue Dream on a dare two years ago when you were getting the take and they dared you to try a hit of Blue Dream. You ended up caving in and got so high you started bragging to him and Dreamweaver about your genius system. Where upon they blackmailed you into giving them a cut…” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s a bit of a longer than average hug and it’s pretty obvious that there has always been a little something there between the two of you, but thanks to your curse you’ve never tried to pursue it. Vera herself probably believes that you’re just not interested in her that way at this point. <EOS>
<BOS> “Uh, yeah I know, but I was afraid if you thought everything went completely well, you would have sent us out again.” <EOS>
<BOS> The trip to Hessla is surprisingly uneventful. You half figured you'd at least run into a few idiots trying to rob you on the road, but other than travellers, and a few merchants, you don't encounter anyone else on it. <EOS>
<BOS> One is quite young - a little girl who mostly keeps to her room drawing pictures, pictures that shimmer and grow thin until she must replace them. She likes your stories though, and sometimes draws a picture for you that you duly hang up in your room until it vanishes. Did pictures always disappear? You can't remember. <EOS>
<BOS> “But getting back to the murder. While tragic, I have to weigh all arguments. We all know that Klint himself was no angel. I’m sorry to say that in front of his parents, but it’s true. This was a case of the stupid antics of youth getting way out of hand. And as much as I dislike this budding criminal in front of me, I truly don’t believe he killed Klint out of malice. <EOS>
<BOS> You can't believe this. You knew you should have gotten a divorce a long time ago. You just kept putting it off for other things you thought were more important at the time. You didn't think about the potential consequences. <EOS>
<BOS> “Mm, that’s always a possibility. Though our own information says Peter’s come to some sort of understanding with them this time and they won’t interfere, however that doesn’t matter. Peter’s invasion isn’t going to succeed.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So you just got boxes of tame qweepas in there?” <EOS>
<BOS> You slowly walk into the dimly lit foyer with your weapon drawn. You search the downstairs cautiously and methodically, but don’t find any one. In the back of your mind you wish this was just a simple breaking and entering job because you’re seeing a lot fancy decoration and you’re sure Reginald has more portable valuables laying around in a safe or something somewhere. <EOS>
<BOS> “Curse my parents for some of their morality getting through…” you say and head over to the cage. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? No! I don’t want to get rid of it!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad to see you’re finally thinking rationally. Okay, let’s not waste anymore time, I’m going to have my acolytes prepare the summoning room. Heather can take you to it in about ten minutes or so. Since she’s going to be directly involved in this ritual, I would recommend that you take that time to start getting yourself ready. I trust you like girls and I assume that Heather is attractive enough for you. However, I understand if these conditions are making you feel a little under pressure so if Heather’s physical charms aren’t enough, we can resort to magic means if necessary. I’d rather we didn’t though since these types of things always work better under natural conditions.” Elder Flynn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I’m going to use it to try to convince Scales to assassinate Jake. Tom said Ed used to do it all the time.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> “Me?” You blurt out, “But why don’t you deal with him if you know so much? You’re the great wizard who has watched over our village for so long!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that answers one obvious question, but why other one would be why? I mean not that I particularly care I suppose, but I was under the impression you were somewhat friends with this girl.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh yes. When I was shopping around for potential places. Your children...Um...Carl and Anika..." <EOS>
<BOS> "Disgusting is right, the little shit tried to grab my ass once and made a bunch of stupid sexual innuendo. He's lucky I didn't cut his dick off and only stabbed his hand." Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit…was that really necessary?” you ask rubbing the back of your head. <EOS>
<BOS> “You ever thought about working for me directly?” <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t sure about Vera’s feelings towards you or her slave trading, but you can address those later when you get there. The first major step is negotiating with the Syndicate since you aren’t sure if they’re actually going to let you walk away or not. If they don’t, well that might put a crimp in your plans. <EOS>
<BOS> "I don't need any of this," the slug said, "although this seashell is quite pretty." He slimed over to a spiral shell with beautiful markings. "If I had a shady home like this, I wouldn't need to fear the sun so much." <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…but no…but I got some (hic) news…” Virgil answers. <EOS>
<BOS> “Actually might be time to get you a ring, however maybe not right away. Tell me more about Fel son. How is he exactly towards you? Does he scare you?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Is it? Think about it. Wasn’t Peter’s fleet just a little bigger than you planned despite all of Vera’s promises that she was going to convince Hessla pirates otherwise?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wha fuck!” he utters before you go crashing into him. <EOS>
<BOS> The pair of the them begin to calm down and cease crying while you’re coming up with a risky idea. <EOS>
<BOS> You smile. “All right, then. A story set on a frigid, wintery day – in a courtyard, where a sundial stands to mark the time.” <EOS>
<BOS> Year 26 <EOS>
<BOS> “No, it’s Randi. I got some information that you might want to know.” A woman’s voice says <EOS>
<BOS> “Well geez son, don’t sound so enthusiastic. Last year you kept asking me if you were any closer to getting into the Guild headquarters.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It doesn’t really work that way.” <EOS>
<BOS> Now that you're rethinking this, the less paper work the better and you are probably going to be better off located in the poorer area of the city too. <EOS>
<BOS> "Really?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, this isn’t exactly how I expected to start out here in this city, but I’d be a fool to dismiss the potential help. I could probably learn a few things while I’m here. In fact I’m used to working with a partner anyway.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “You okay?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t understand.” <EOS>
<BOS> As you down the water, Tanya cuddles up next to you lovingly. <EOS>
<BOS> "I recommend you worry about yourself, first," he warns. "You seem like a nice enough guy, like my grandpa. Just go back to bed and forget about this." <EOS>
<BOS> Luckily you manage to arrive unaccosted by anyone, the law or otherwise. Now you’re just hoping you find Tanya before the fun begins. <EOS>
<BOS> “And I intend to keep it that way.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You should have thought about that before you decided to move in on my woman.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I won't let them destroy you," you promise, "there must be a better way to save memory. And to bring you back! I know I am old, that things cannot return to the way they once were, but I can't imagine the world going on without you. Is there any way to save you?" <EOS>
<BOS> Just as one of the slack jawed dead eyed corpses gets within reach of you, you’re suddenly floating upward! After lingering in the air for a moment, you slowly start floating over the street causing the rest of the corpses to follow and go right over the side of the building. It’s fascinating and scary as hell at the same time since you could easily be dropping to your own death right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Then the next day you do it all over again. It truly is a wonderful thing to be free! <EOS>
<BOS> Looks like she took Wart’s suggestion to heart. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, well that’ll be where you’re heading if you have ill intent in this city. And that’s if you’re lucky.” <EOS>
<BOS> The woman tells you her name is Keira and her village is Tarvo. She goes on about how it was absorbed by the Empire decades ago and how they used to even have a sizable amount of soldiers there, but eventually they realized the village was never going to be a problem as far as rebellions go. As it stands there are only a few soldiers and a single Galpatis official who probably got sent there because he pissed someone off. As a result he doesn’t really enforce many official Galpatian laws other than something obvious like murder or rape and allows everyone to go about their normal lives. <EOS>
<BOS> Cautiously, you return to the Grove. The million whispers are quieter, now, the calls less strong, as if whatever is reaching out to you has realized you are not interested. <EOS>
<BOS> If you ever get back to Hessla, you swear to the gods that you're leaving and never setting foot on a ship again. <EOS>
<BOS> As you start to head in, the lead Shadow Blade grabs your shoulder and whispers to you. <EOS>
<BOS> Groaning in pain, you fumble to grab your pistol. You manage to turn over and get off a shot, dropping one of your assailants, but the other quickly wrestles the weapon from you and begins beating you in the face with it. Your attempts to struggle soon come to an end as he begins destroying your nose along with the rest of your face with it. <EOS>
<BOS> You and Heather follow Elder Flynn into his chambers which contains a lot of tables filled with bottles, jars, and other laboratory equipment. More books of course and several strange markings on the floor. <EOS>
<BOS> In other words, a woman of quality. <EOS>
<BOS> “It may, because for all we know you might have some hidden agenda.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So…it was a kindness. I mean it’s a little unorthodox, and granted I’m certainly not shedding any tears, but it wasn’t like you killed him in cold blood.” <EOS>
<BOS> "You're running for the Klyton Council? Why now?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Couldn’t leave it like that. You deserve a proper goodbye.” Tanya says still looking at the ocean. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course despite all this AND the fact that she tried to kill you today, you still go to sleep dreaming about her. <EOS>
<BOS> "Who's that?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> "There you are. You didn't happen to see this morning's paper did you?" Mr. Reynolds asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit. You ARE having a hard time. Well hell, come on let’s put that to good use.” <EOS>
<BOS> "You're right, it couldn't be worse than this. Come back, I forgive you." You suddenly hear a voice say that sounds exactly like Zalmora. <EOS>
<BOS> “Continue to…nevermind. Let me just disarm this and we can get the fuck out of here. And pay attention to what I’m doing!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Let me guess, everyone got all friendly?” <EOS>
<BOS> The more you think about it, you’re starting to wonder about what the hell you’re doing with your own life and it isn’t exactly as good as it could be. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh you didn’t kill all of them.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What are you lot doing? Don’t tell me you finished them off already.” The Watchman captain remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> You almost wonder if you should just run for your life. As strange as it is, you haven’t been in a real life or death fight in years since you’ve been here. You’re probably a little rusty. There’s also the fact that most of the people you ever fought with were other humans. Orcs are a whole different story. Especially this blood thirsty looking lot. <EOS>
<BOS> “Didn’t think you were the settling down type, but I imagine unconditional obsession wrapped in that package is a bit hard to turn down. Must be nice to be loved so unconditionally.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, but I’m establishing how things are going to work already. THEY will wait for ME. They’re at my beck and call, not the other way around.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> Several hours into a bumpy and uncomfortable ride on a stubborn donkey, the journey starts to feel more real to you. Dreaming forest is just a verdant line in the distance behind you, Dreaming Village not even visible. Far to the east and west are mountains, the western ones volcanic, and between them lie the wide, ashy plains you ride through. <EOS>
<BOS> “No…well partly that, but I was thinking more of how this was where we spent our first time of intimacy together. That was such a special moment for me, in more ways than one I think.” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> As soon as she steps out of the inn, you sit there in a daze for a while, but then you suddenly snap out of it. <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t unconscious for long as Tanya soon slaps you awake. <EOS>
<BOS> This all of course has alerted the other bandit who doesn’t waste anytime in attacking you. He starts off by kicking his buddy who you’re still holding to. The dead weight of a dying man being pushed hard in your direction is enough to cause you to lose balance and fall backwards with a body on top of you. <EOS>
<BOS> With a few gruff orders, you and Mr. Scars are both taken to a nearby tree and tied to it securely with a rope while the rest of the soldiers make camp. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re not quite sure why she still hangs around. She doesn’t do poetry anymore and you’re fairly certain she’s not still fucking him either. She’s not even a junkie. As near as you can figure, she’s just living here for free and helping out with keeping the inn running so it doesn’t get shut down and she’s living on the streets. <EOS>
<BOS> Gloom and his people will be a little more difficult, but the pair of you come up with something that should work. It’ll just require a little bullshit on your part, but you’ve been doing that for so long that you’re definitely an expert in it. In any event, you’re going to go meet with Gloom while Heather plans to ambush Percy. <EOS>
<BOS> Marco turns to you and speaks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah, so you’re TRYING to fuck her.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh don’t worry son, we’re not soldiers for the Delantium Kingdom or any other law men if that’s what you’re worried about. I just get a vibe from you, that you might be…shall I say skilled in the less than legal endeavors. I’m usually good at judging people with only a bit of observation…so am I right?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Surprised nobody’s tried to kill him and take power from him.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, what the hell do these folks expect? If they want outlandish theatrics they can pay out the ass to watch a Klyton Gladiator match where the minimum bets are much higher. At least here we have fights where we’ll accept a five copper bet.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> While Lloyd pours himself a glass of some sort of liquor and sits down, Rook steps out from behind his desk and approaches you. <EOS>
<BOS> “You expect me to believe you stole this for me?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…(hic) Yeah, this big guy. I mean not like ogre big, but just human big ya know? Old guy too. (hic) I mean not as old as that asshole who own this place, but probably around my age.” Virgil says. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, but I doubt that they’re going very far. We’ll get the rest of them later.” You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit.” You exclaim and realize that Randi has left you a reminder of your good time with her. You really should have known better you suppose, but you’re still angry. And you don’t feel any less angry when you bump into her in the hallway. <EOS>
<BOS> In fact, you've actually gotten very paranoid recently that maybe it isn't something of this world doing this, but maybe, just maybe Wendy's warning was right... <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I suppose you would know about that. You never told me all this about having a family and shit.” <EOS>
<BOS> “The gods are truly merciful this night! I knew your father! You look a lot like him when he was young. My name’s Tom and I used to go to school with your father!” <EOS>
<BOS> She moves her head back enough and looks at you with tears in her eyes. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well you and Warts are the closest thing I have to seconds and I doubt if Warts wants the commitment. So you’re the obvious choice.” <EOS>
<BOS> Tom’s head drops down briefly with a deep sigh and then he looks up. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s Tanya and her transformation is now complete. Gone are any vestiges of “modesty” as she’s completely naked. Her skin has become a deep red, she has shiny black wings, and her horns are certainly prominent through her long white hair. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re going over some of your expenses, you hear a knock at your office door. <EOS>
<BOS> Your arms are feeling like anchors, but you continue to swim with a fish bitch on your back. Your head is filled with a haunting chorus that you're desperately trying to drown out with nonsensical shouting. <EOS>
<BOS> “I trust you know to keep your mouth shut about this.” You say to Layla. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well yes, but that’s mainly because your conscious mind came to the conclusion that I must have put a curse on you so you used THAT as an excuse to not get involved with another woman again. Even this Vera woman, that you obviously had a lot of affection for. I dare say if you had actually given it a chance you might have even broke the cycle. Enough time had passed between us by then and your feelings for Vera were much stronger than they were for the other women. But your love for me just proved too strong. Think about it. Even though she betrayed you, you could have just killed her or even forgave her if you so desired. Instead, you sacrificed her to summon me.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Get him some," the captain snaps. "The Cavendish brute is worth more alive than dead." <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh trust me, I want nothing more than to get you on all fours and thrust into you until you’re crying from so much pleasure.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I got business there. I’d really appreciate it if you could tell me how I could get there from here.” You say walking towards her, but then you experience a moment of fatigue and your legs give out causing you to partially collapse to the ground. The woman goes to help you up. <EOS>
<BOS> Then again, Hessla might not be that bad, if you already had a bit of coin to throw around while you assessed the opportunities there. You think that there is probably a good amount of supplies here on the carriage you could sell. Let alone the horses and carriage themselves. The driver doesn’t exactly look like a fighter and might even have a few coins to his name. <EOS>
<BOS> You are dismissed and the Claw member who took you to see Ponyride escorts you away and then leaves you to your own devices. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thanks boss, I’ll see you later.” Vera says and suddenly kisses you on the cheek before walking off to enjoy living the “high society life” for a little longer. <EOS>
<BOS> "Satisfied?" <EOS>
<BOS> As you row away from the burning, sinking, and sometimes still exploding ship, you can still hear the mermaid song and it feels like it's getting through now. You can't think of anything else to do, so you start shouting nonsense at the top of your lungs. <EOS>
<BOS> "Knowledge is priceless," the first woman says. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s no secret that Annah was certainly drawn to you because she’s a little on the wild side and doesn’t have the best of reputations herself. While she certainly lets you do things to her that are a lot of fun, she’s not the partner in crime that your sister was and she certainly complains a lot more. A LOT more. <EOS>
<BOS> When your feet finally hit the ground, you breathe a sigh of relief. You take a brief glance at the rocky pathway. The castle is a tiny dot in the distance, barely visible through the sunlight. A crumpled body lies not 20 feet from where you're standing. A victim of the climb down, his body looks freshly dead, though it's harder to tell with several bones sticking out from the skin. The man's face is unrecognizable. You search his body for anything useful and come up empty. Whatever things he was carrying is long gone. A few broken branches alert you of activity in the area. Upon closer inspection, the grass is smashed in the same area. It had to be the raiding party. You take off in the forest towards the tracks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well you may be right, but come on, don’t you think we’re at least above that sort of guileless criminal activity? Besides, you send some of these people out there to do that and it isn’t like you can keep as good of an eye on them. If they get successful enough, they may just decide to keep everything and fuck off elsewhere leaving us with nothing.” <EOS>
<BOS> Well that command couldn’t be much clearer. <EOS>
<BOS> You head to the large back room of the inn, where you’re met by several criminal types. A lot of them have already been drinking heavily. Some nod at you with respect, while others not so much. <EOS>
<BOS> You grab your walking staff, and rise. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good, we can start on the way there then.” Annah says. <EOS>
<BOS> Someone, not very far away, is in bitter agony. You can't understand most of the words he pleads in between cries, but you recognize a few as the names of Cavindish gods. Someone from the far south, then - hardy folk, but generally not prone to travel. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good! I knew you would! You didn’t get where you are by being an idiot! Now that business is over, I’m going to be in the city a few more days before coming to see you again for the first payment. Now I know you’re a busy man with busy people, so I don’t expect you lot to see to me and I’m more than capable of protecting myself. However, I would like some suggestions on where all the good spots to have fun and unwind are here.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Well, after working for so many other people, I've sort of come to the conclusion that I'd like to try to work for myself for a change. I was sort of inspired by the old family business and I've done a lot of research on the matter along with asking my parents questions of course. I got quite a bit of money saved up from over the years and I was looking for a place to buy and get a business started. I thought your tavern would be a good place." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> A month passes and she does indeed make it back of which you’re most relieved. <EOS>
<BOS> When you finally get back to the neighborhood, you revert back your cautious ways until you finally enter the Welcome Mat and your room. You manage to make it without being accosted by any of its denizens this time. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not that it’s any of your business, but no.” <EOS>
<BOS> Still, you really don’t want to be here all night. You made your appearance and now you’d like nothing more than to leave. Vera however looks like she’s having a good time and to be honest you don’t want to ruin that. She does help you a lot with the League. <EOS>
<BOS> “Just one of the perks of being allied with the temple of Fel I suppose. Gloom had one of his members deliver this letter to me a week ago. Apparently Baroness Ludmilla has heard interesting things about me and would like me to show up at her party so she can see for herself.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes, Empress," you bow, then take your appointed place before the assembly, "Empress, Officials, members of the Imperial Court, and distinguished guests, hear my tale! This is the story of the Clever Stableman." <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I guess you’re right.” <EOS>
<BOS> Your balls still ache, the top of your head is sore, your foot hurts like hell and you’re pretty sure you’ve got a bone fragment in it, but Reginald is currently choking on his own blood and struggling to breath with a mashed up nose and broken jaw so you’re currently doing much better than he is. <EOS>
<BOS> “You seem very sure and very well informed on this. Have you increased your telepathic powers or something?” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I’m good really. Shit…I just need to rest for awhile. Gather my strength again.” Dusk replies. <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t do anything! But Annah is severely wounded, you gotta help her. She’s got a knife in her stomach and she’s over by Jasmine’s shop! Please! You have to hurry!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “Geez, Vaugh you’re really behind aren’t you? Our glorious leader here turned down her advances a few weeks ago. Surprised the hell out of me too, but messing with another man’s girlfriend isn’t one of the vices he has apparently. It appears though school girl figured out a loop hole and took matters into her own hands.” Zal explains. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually Warts returns with Dusk who indeed looks very battle worn. The robe he wears is in tatters making him look more like a begger and his skin that’s exposed is obviously burned. His face even has several fresh wounds on it. <EOS>
<BOS> As you go to get another you bump into a couple that are making out. <EOS>
<BOS> “Argh! Fuck!” you exclaim waking up. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh?” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I’m not having my son joining a bunch of fanatics.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> The cliff’s edge becomes crowded as the mountain’s inhabitants rush for a viewing spot. From within the monastery's eastern wall, a pillar of smoke rises through the air. Like ants spewing from an anthill, soldiers pour over the surrounding hills charging towards the monastery. Large flaming projectiles fly in the air, their siege constructs hidden by the hills. <EOS>
<BOS> You need to just get the hell out of here, because staying is surely going to doom someone. <EOS>
<BOS> “Believe what you wish, the point is that it’s yours now my dear.” You say and put the necklace in her hand. Tanya looks at the necklace in disbelief, and addresses you again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Actually I was wondering if you’d be interested in doing a job with me. I’m well aware of your skills and I think it would go a lot easier with your assistance.” <EOS>
<BOS> “This idea that we’ll just pick up everything after everything is over is laughable, because there won’t be that much left and what IS left, Peter Varsakken is going to be establishing order over, and I’m telling you right now, whether he’s as corrupt as the rest of his family or not isn’t the issue. The issue is, we DON’T have a good working relationship with him like we do with his sister. Shit like that takes time and trust, both of which we are in short supply of. And to top it all off the ECS is going to still be breathing down our necks telling us we better pay up by the end of the month. How are we going to fucking do that if all of our income has turned to fucking rubble? Is ANY of this getting through or am I talking to a bunch of fucking retards?” <EOS>
<BOS> “While this isn’t as delicate as one might think, still be careful with it. You sure about this? I mean I still don’t think this thing with Jake is that serious.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I would like to speak to the Captain soon," you tell Spryce, "if it's all right." <EOS>
<BOS> “What do you mean? Isn’t this city her home?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Heh, if I thought that might help, I might suggest it, but even if that was successful, you’re still kicking a hell of a lot of coin to not just the Holgard government in bribes, but to the ECS for their cut as well. And that will be true even if Peter doesn’t invade Holgard or fails.” <EOS>
<BOS> Fuck this inn, fuck the Crimson Talons, fuck this city and fuck your fake marriage. You've had enough of all of it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Pfft, not much worse.” Tom says. <EOS>
<BOS> Infernal influence or not, you’re not going to let her go into this alone. Besides you wouldn’t mind taking out that one eyed asshole, or at least that fucker that keeps shoving a crossbow in your back. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, well boyfriend then.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yep. Hey look I gotta get back to work or my dad will hide me.” The little boy says and goes back inside. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, at least it makes the trip not boring and they aren’t questioning why you’re carrying a box full of big rats. (Which you have to keep from escaping every now and then) <EOS>
<BOS> Actually he’s got a bit of a point. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well as I said, I’m not here for potions, I’m here to see if you can assist me with my son’s condition which I doubt if any potion is going to cure and a doctor isn’t going to be able to help either.” <EOS>
<BOS> “But you’re the boss, can’t you just do what you want?” <EOS>
<BOS> You thought he was bad on Numb, but ever since you had to start stealing a poor substitute used mainly on people with the plague, he’s gotten a lot worse. He even offered to blow you for a fix once. It was pretty pathetic. <EOS>
<BOS> Looks like you’ll be going to war with the ECS and you’ll be firing the first shot. Really wish you could have avoided this, but that’s no other way. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Zalmora, Vaughn and a couple of the ex-Talons on your side begin to yell, but you calm everyone down. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not this far out. For the moment they seem content staying to the roads. I fear that won’t be the case once the castle falls. Ah, here we are.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh shit.” You mutter as you ponder this new possibility. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well the bodies aren’t exactly outside your front door, more like just near your shop. One of them is just outside the butcher’s shop a few doors down though.” <EOS>
<BOS> Vera at this point goes on about how she’s glad that you’re doing this. She also apologizes if she over stepped a boundary by touching your hand the way she did since she’s aware of your whole “not fucking co-workers” policy. She goes on to say that she just sometimes feels very close to you and probably due to not seeing you for awhile combined with all the mess that’s been going on caused her to briefly display greater affection. She says it won’t happen again. <EOS>
<BOS> You attempt to pass the soldiers in front of you and are met by their spears. To their credit, they actually do try to subdue you first by slamming you to the ground, but when you continue to struggle and kick, one of the less patient ones skewers you in the side which is then followed by another spear to your chest. You bleed out like the proverbial stuck pig and wheeze like one as breathing becomes more difficult. <EOS>
<BOS> “I was waiting for your caravan.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> In fact it gets to a point where the Baroness demands that ALL hostilities between the religious factions come to a halt or she’ll be sending in soldiers to deal with everyone involved. This goes about as well as you might expect. <EOS>
<BOS> “But I have no money,” you reply, a little disappointed that he won’t help you free of charge. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, you don’t want to get too far ahead. If Zal did come to help, the least you can do is wait for her. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, you must be Annie. Where's your slug of a brother?" <EOS>
<BOS> You practically leap over the bar to embrace her. This is definitely a reunion you never thought would come. Your employees never see you act this way normally, so they're a little surprised, but go about their work. <EOS>
<BOS> The pair of them were rogues through and through and as they got older it was apparent they had no desire to change. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, why?” <EOS>
<BOS> "We should burn it all down now," another suggested, "we already have the order to destroy it." <EOS>
<BOS> “I can see how a flying demon might very well attract attention in a civilized area.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Since your garments are mostly blue, this gains you nods from the one side and glares from the other. You learn quickly not to even enter a shop of the owner has hund a gold ribbon from the frame. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the hell have you been doing with these elves, Halford? They look like shit and nobody wants elven bitches that look like shit, they want them to look like they just came out of the fairy kingdom farting rainbows and sunshine.” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “What do you mean?” <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re trying to leave the inn, you bump into Randi, the red headed whore that lives in the building. Better than that drunk Joachim priest Virgil asking for a donation again you suppose. <EOS>
<BOS> Rook might be testing you to see if you’ll lie to him or not. You’d rather not take that chance so you better just come clean now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fire! Captain! We’re under attack!” <EOS>
<BOS> "It's all right, I won't turn you in. You aren't the typical homeless bum palming corny fables for drink money." <EOS>
<BOS> “Perhaps in some ways, but its all been worth it. No point in wondering what if. In fact, given where I was mentally before we actually got together, I’m glad this is where choices led me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “This isn’t a game mayor, but I think we’re about to see one. Marco! You’re back with Zamed and whoever these other people are.” You say turning your attention away from the mayor and the woman for a moment. <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, he was okay at first, but now....well I find him…limited. I’d rather be with you. I like the way I feel when you’re around encouraging me. Camid doesn’t understand anything that I talk about. He just stares at my tits and wants to fuck.” <EOS>
<BOS> The power enables you to speak, you, not the merely the voice within. “Here I thought to use your power for myself, a tool to be used and discarded. In reality, it was the other way around. Were you always destined to be reborn through me?” <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm sorry for your loss," he says after a moment. "I have no objection to sharing a room." <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh? I…I live…um…in Teckleville.” You say desperately trying to find the words to get out of this. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I just joined so you better watch out.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah. You didn’t know that? His buddy David used to tell stories about her and make jokes all the time back when he was still alive. She used to work as a miner and had a girlfriend who Tom always insisted was just her roommate even though they slept in the same bed. Still in denial about it, though he might actually be that clueless. Y’know, I don’t think he ever knew who his father was. Now that I think about it, I’m sort of wondering how Tom was even conceived in the first place considering from what I heard his mother was firmly into pussy.” <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya picks you up by the other good arm and dangles you above the ground like a slab of meat. You look into her one good eye and see a fury that isn’t just one of normal hate or even demonic rage. It’s the stare of one who has been betrayed by their one true love. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I mean I’m not sure, I suppose, but look I gotta get outta here!” you say and push both of your parents out of the way to go gather a few things from your room. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I certainly understand sir.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck you. I’ll have you know I’m in my forties…I think…yeah…” <EOS>
<BOS> Samuel takes a seat at the center table. He’d been standing too long without his cane. He breathes out an exhausted breath. “Because I’ve checked. I’ve spent years carefully working through all the volumes we have in the library. It’s not there.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey look, I’m not proud. If I gotta suck your dick in order to convince you to set up a new slave market here and make me head slaver, then that’s what I’ll fucking do.” <EOS>
<BOS> Vera goes over to the door and locks it, which immediately causes you to draw on her. <EOS>
<BOS> “No problem, but I’m going to warn you once now. I certainly HOPE if you’re sticking around the city, that you have every intention of being a productive citizens. Because if you don’t, well…let’s just say we don’t take kindly to crime around here. I trust you saw all those cages down the road.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno. I know you have a lucky habit of getting over on the Syndicate, but I feel like this is pushing it. I have to think they must know something, but they’re biding their time to lull you into a false sense of security before they strike.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Do not even fucking think about it sweetheart. I will fucking shoot you in both tits and then after I’m done killing the rest of these sorry excuses for Syndicate members, I will violate your dying body and the last thing you’re going to feel before you leave this shitty earth is me coming inside your ass and laughing while doing it.” You threaten. <EOS>
<BOS> As you drift off to sleep, your thoughts go to your sister. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, well we probably should start gathering them too in time, but we’ll deal with the Black Hooks first. <EOS>
<BOS> "I thought that was complete?" <EOS>
<BOS> “You hate cuddling. You always say it feels like you’re being confined.” Annah replies. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re guessing she’s been lying about being in college, but it has to be more than that if she’s actually living in one of the dorms. You remember your dad saying he lived in one for a while and how it was a big hassle to get a room in one. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, how elven. Alright when’s the soonest you can get all this done?” <EOS>
<BOS> By the time you get settled your first night in Jicol, your dreams are back to normal and you hope they stay that way. <EOS>
<BOS> The donkey doesn't much like being shoved into the small shed, but it's either that or the ash. You can't imagine he'll sell for much after this trip. <EOS>
<BOS> The Inquisitor starts screaming prayers to Joachim, but nothing happens, the rest of his people seem confused by this sudden “disappearance” of their divine weapon, but you’re not confused and you urge your people to press the advantage since Shade is obviously no longer in any shape to do so. <EOS>
<BOS> “Annah, okay THAT is not even true. I don’t have any control over how you…” <EOS>
<BOS> Vera approaches you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well what if we were fucking?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, well in any case, I’m still going to try to speed this up with the Syndicate. After that, then I can get the hell out of this city.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s okay, I’ve got something that’s going to make magic in general completely useless to everyone.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> The watering hole was an unlikely place for treasure - too crowded, anyone could stumble across it. And the clearing would have few places to hide, unless it was buried - but there, too, it was crowded. So, the slug decided to try the tree first, as it was near sacred and barely visited save for the Festival of the Tree. <EOS>
<BOS> “What’s the point of stealing shit, if we’re not going to have fun with it?! I’m tired of eating low class food and never getting to wear any of the shinies we take. If I wanted that life, I would have stayed in Teckleville.” <EOS>
<BOS> You look to your right and see a large humanoid in an oversized chair, arms folded and snoring heavily. You wonder if this must be Olaf. He’s certainly big and ugly enough to be an ogre, though in this state he almost looks peaceful rather than the menacing brute you heard about. <EOS>
<BOS> Stone City is not the place you expected. It isn't just that public storytelling is, once again, banned. It isn't the stiff, imposing buildings of stone crowding in on each other. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh trust me, ever since I stepped foot into this city, I’ve been on my guard constantly. Don’t really know any other way to live at this point. However I’m going to soon be hiring a lot of cheap muscle in the form of all the hobgoblins, so I’m slightly less concerned about the Syndicate.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m actually no stranger to being stealthy myself when I have to be.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, I think that was their old name. Heard something about a change in leadership and apparently the new leader is some sort of psycho. Nearly got into it with a few of them two days ago saying that I better not be working on their turf. Which apparently is practically most of the city according to them.” <EOS>
<BOS> Sighing, you return to the directory. From this side, you can see the back of it which is plastered with posters. Two, in particular, catch your eye: <EOS>
<BOS> “Grm, well lyin’ will serve you well in Holgard. The city has a lotz o’ opportunities, for someone like you.” <EOS>
<BOS> Now this really sounds like a trick. <EOS>
<BOS> And here it comes… <EOS>
<BOS> "A TOWN?!" They exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “What in Dorna’s name is going on here?” a voice shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> “How the hell you know this?” <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya suddenly gets back up and even with one eye left and a broken horn from your bullets, she flat out ignores the pain of having a hole burned straight through her armor and body as Gwen attempts to stop her second charge at her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, I knew it.” You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> "Dustan Palmer," Kemris introduces you. "A storyteller from Dreaming Forest. He's on a pilgrimage to the Grove of Muses." <EOS>
<BOS> It’s going to be one of those days… <EOS>
<BOS> She tells you that you were right all along and that siding with Peter isn’t the best way to go on this based on the meeting she had. Vera tells you that his terms weren’t even very good, just basic amnesty for anything done before he takes back the city and perhaps a bit of leniency on softer criminal activity, but not continued free reign like you have now. <EOS>
<BOS> Scully seems to be a bit lost in thought when he mentions the mermaids. Looks like they really had an effect on him, but he doesn't seem shaken by the experience. The opposite actually, like he vaguely seems disappointed that you probably won't be encountering them on this trip. <EOS>
<BOS> "Sir." you address the mage, "would you share a room with me?" <EOS>
<BOS> Before you can even answer, Annah speaks up. <EOS>
<BOS> “Worried? Hmm…perhaps a little cautious, but the situation isn’t nearly as grim as your sources told you which you said was from a pirate captain he hired?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Let’s go some place else to discuss this. Probably not at the Guild headquarters or Hell’s Own, though, um…let’s go the Lighthouse.” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> The carriage makes its way through Hessla, which is definitely not how you expected it look. You imagined pirates and vagabonds of all types getting into fights and drinking in the streets, but just like the driver said, it isn’t actually all that bad. <EOS>
<BOS> “Do you know of a cheap place to sleep for the night?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, it was just a question. Sheesh…that’s some girl you got there son. Good luck to ya with that one.” The man says in a way that sounds sympathic. <EOS>
<BOS> “As I said, she’s been a fucking bitch and even if I wasn’t leaving the city, I’d probably be moving out soon anyway. Trust me, she’s got this coming.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I know, but I truly think this is going to be for the best in the long run." <EOS>
<BOS> “Halt, you two don’t look like merchants or anyone else that has a real job. In fact you both look a bit suspicious sneaking about the city at this time of night.” One of the guards says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hate waiting, but fine. I suppose in the meantime I’ll start getting shit ready on our side of things, since even if Zamed falls through, we’re still doing this. Guess I better inform Marco that his days at sea aren’t quite finished yet since he’ll be the one to take the merchant ship seeing as he’s got the most experience with it and nobody else here is much of a sailor.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I mean you invited me over, you’re showing off your big house and you’re plying me with alcohol. You don’t need to wait until I pass out, I’m more than willing right now.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Still at it?" Spryce asks form the ladder. "Guess he's still alive, for now. Anyway, Brost wants to see you. We make port in an hour." <EOS>
<BOS> Two thousand years ago, the mages and the muses fought a bitter war over the fate of several lesser, fledgling human civilizations. The muses wished to inspire the humans to greatness, gently guiding them from behind the scenes to raise kingdoms of their own and chart the lands of Sandrella, even if it would be a long and thankless commitment. The mages wished to guide the humans through more overt and forceful means, subjugating them, ruling them as colonies until such they were mature enough to live independently, but also giving them knowledge in exchange. The mages thought the muses were being foolish, and feared the humans would turn on them. The muses accused the mages of cruelty and power-seeking, and feared the humans would be enslaved by them. <EOS>
<BOS> From what little you now know of this Reginald, this guy is into some dark shit. Everything about this makes you want to just get the hell out right now, but you’re already here now and you’d hate to just leave with wine bottles. <EOS>
<BOS> "Wait, he burned everyone?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh ‘ere he is. Fuckin’ thought you’d never show up.” One says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, before we moved in, hasn’t that temple been abandoned for at least over a couple hundred years?” <EOS>
<BOS> You force yourself to watch this brutal spectacle and you even shed a few tears thinking that maybe she didn’t deserve this. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, yeah, so Teckleville huh? Hmm….wait a minute!” <EOS>
<BOS> With the immediate threat over with, you and Heather head back down the ladder where thankfully there aren’t anymore walking dead lurking about. Heather’s students soon meet up with the both of you. They look even more tired than she does and you notice there are significantly less of them than the last time you remember. <EOS>
<BOS> “Face it, you never got over me.” <EOS>
<BOS> As the two of you eat, you turn the conversation back to the muses. "There's a blockade," you say, dropping your voice, "half the forest is blocked off. I'd hoped to visit the Grove while I am here." <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well I can’t backstab everyone, it might hurt my reputation.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I love you…” she says. <EOS>
<BOS> When you get back you inform Tom, who doesn’t seem at all concerned, just a little surprised that it isn’t Olaf, but he has confidence in Mr. Reynold’s choice of assassin and is sure it will be worth it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Is it contraband, sir?” one of them asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Finally got your ass! It’s like they always say, you want something done right, ya gotta do it yourself. So you think you can just get away with shooting our members like some cowardly sonofabitch?” the shadow magic wielder remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> You head upstairs feeling a little weird about all this, while you’re waiting you almost have second thoughts, then the girl comes in. <EOS>
<BOS> “He hasn’t been bothering me Garrick, if anything he’s been honoring my wishes. He’s been a perfect fucking gentleman…or at least as close as he can get to one.” <EOS>
<BOS> Of course as soon as you come in, your mother sees you covered in blood and demands to know what is going on. <EOS>
<BOS> Garrick is pointing the pistol right at you and ready to fire. You might be quick enough to stop him, or you might not. Tanya looks like she might do something, but who knows? <EOS>
<BOS> “I can’t even be bothered to go through this shit right now.” Rook says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, so what message did you want to send?” Marco asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because obviously I’m still an optimistic idiot.” <EOS>
<BOS> Rook, nowadays rarely leaves his mansion. You aren’t sure who had it before he did, but you do know he just took it over soon after the Guild was wiped out. You’re stopped at the front gate by one of the Ebony Claw members. <EOS>
<BOS> “I was about to send some people to Jicol to go after you guys. What’s this around Kol’s neck?” Vera says as she takes Kol from you. <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve never told anyone this, but you’re convinced that having sex results in your partner’s death. Not instantly, but there’s been too many incidences for it to be a coincidence. <EOS>
<BOS> Well now you really do feel like an asshole. You actually figured if Annah did have any strong feelings for you, she had gotten over them fairly quickly. <EOS>
<BOS> Such blank pages also quite rare, considering most people who buy them quickly use them to write down stories heard long ago from now-dead grandparents, or to pen letters to their wives or mistresses without the more fictional elements of their professions of love fading upon the recipient reading their words. The merchant would likely know many potential buyers for such a prize, and even if what he gave you would be a fraction of what he might eventually sell it for, the money you could get for a single page would be more than enough to fund the beginning of your journey.You wait an hour until the morning visitors to the garden look a bit tired of walking, then set up by one of the fountains that has viewing benches around it. The traveling merchant, seeing an opportunity, points you out to the individuals and groups, herding the small crowd your way. You see why he is so enthusiastic about pointing out the storyteller to the others, as he pulls out hot thermoses and sweet treats, selling them snacks and drinks as they sit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yinen? Yeah I know him! He was a fence for the Thieves Guild. Well for the Syndicate too really, maybe that’s why the name sounds familar, but in any case the last time I saw him was when I rescued him from a Neroth torture cell. Never did know what happened to him either, where the hell has he been?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Will you listen?! You asked me to explain, so I’m trying to! It’s not that sort of curse anyway. It’s on my dick and that’s why I kept pushing you away.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m sure it would, but I don’t partner with anyone.” <EOS>
<BOS> It's a risk either way, but you figure owning the business outright at least makes you less concerned about somebody else fucking things up, plus you can fix things up the way you want a lot quicker. <EOS>
<BOS> He peers at you over his wine glass. "You feel it? I wonder, I even wondered back on the boat - you might have some latent magic of your own." <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. Well apologies then. So can you please spare any water, I’m dying of thirst over here.” <EOS>
<BOS> Prince Ragar, realizing Lorthander’s message speaks, “Am I destined to forever be a prince, always at my father’s heel? It’s not right. It’s not natural.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I didn't know there would be a storm." You gasp, breathing deep for the first time in an hour. "I'm a storyteller, and just started a Pilgrimage." <EOS>
<BOS> “What does that mean exactly?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why do you stop me mortal?! Do you love this woman?” Tanya asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I knew it! You blame me for everything! You always blame me for everything that goes wrong! All I fucking did was try to help you when Klint was kicking your ass too! (Sob!) You’re right, I DON’T have to be out here, but I’m out here because I fucking love you okay? (Sob!) I don’t even know why, because you’re a fucking ungrateful asshole!” Annah cries and then runs off to a nearby tree to continue sobbing. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, no. I gotta go.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I also really thought we could win. Wasn’t like you were the ECS after all.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I remind you, that if I hadn’t been so much of a fanatic, I would have killed you a long time ago. However, you are right of course unfortunately. Lately I’ve been wondering if all of this that has happened is Fel’s way of punishing me for my hubris and past transgressions. I suppose it is equally amusing that my own rigid fanaticism caused my temple’s downfall, while that same rigid fanaticism is causing the Joachimites’ churches resurgence. Their god has been blessing them not just in the martial ways, but of magic as well. Our own shadow magic is practically rendered useless when faced with their light magic. Can’t even get anyone close enough to stealthily assassinate their known top priests. Let alone the one who’s actually leading them.” <EOS>
<BOS> Peter nods. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah just sniffs at you with a scowl while petting Checkers in her arms. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wha…what’s going on…is it morning all…ULP!” you utter. <EOS>
<BOS> “STOP THAT FUCKER! HE JUST TRIED TO KILL ME!” he shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’d stay away from Garth if I were you,” she says suddenly. “I think he has it out for you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “How iz things dere anyway?” <EOS>
<BOS> “He’s really not going to do anything. He’s just whining in the hopes to prove to his people that he’s still got some balls.” Vera adds. <EOS>
<BOS> “I still can’t believe the Felians are gone completely. I mean I just remember them always being here. Then again, so were a lot of groups I suppose. Still, sort of surprised you managed to gain an alliance with the Dornans.” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good idea, again thanks. I really appreciate this.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, he told me. He told me everything. I always knew you loved me! And now that you’re conscious again, we can have a bit of fun. And I need to have some fun right now.” Madeline says and rushes over to lie next to you in the bed and kisses you. You suddenly feel the force holding you down lifted. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay…if it makes you feel any better, perhaps I AM to blame indirectly. Obviously you didn’t get over me the way I told you too and were still obsessed with my magnificence. I suppose I can’t fault you, after all a mere mortal woman would pale in comparison. But those women? I had no direct hand in causing their deaths. That was ALL you. Even now I can see it in your mind.” <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do… <EOS>
<BOS> “Well then you’re shit at picking a partner and I question your wisdom.” <EOS>
<BOS> It takes a bit of stealth and hiding on your part (along with distancing yourself from Teckleville) but eventually as the sky goes dark, you’re fairly certain nobody from the town is still chasing you, or if they are, they might have made camp for the night. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I know son and I won’t let anyone take you away. But this is just pretend and I want you to ask Fel anyway okay?” <EOS>
<BOS> Now you’re really surprised. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, they put some sort of fucked up drug in the drinks. I was glad I got out of there myself.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> The breeze whispered to Ekk’a. Soft voices, more of a lightless murmur, carried on the wind. His footsteps took him from the warmth of the sunlight into the chilling shade of the open archway. Despite the chill, Ekk’a felt a bead of sweat run down the side of his face. Still holding the bow ready, he wiped the sweat with the back of his forearm. He was almost there. His hunt would be complete. <EOS>
<BOS> You stagger as fast as you can out of the dorm, but thanks to the blow to your head, you’re feeling pretty dizzy. Annah’s shouting also drew the attention of the few others that were currently in the dorm. The fact that she screamed rape doesn’t help as now every other woman in the place is screaming too. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora sighs at you. <EOS>
<BOS> You get out of the carriage with the intent of just running off into the woods, but then you might get lost. It occurs to you that you do have an advantage that will allow you get away a lot faster and still stay on your course. <EOS>
<BOS> “Me too. But he can get away with a lot more than me,” you say. “Hey, I didn’t see you training with us. How’d you get away with that?” <EOS>
<BOS> Your underling instinctively starts swinging his torch at them, but qweepas tend to be a bit more fearless than normal rats especially in a large pack like this and merely just avoid the flames by running around his swing radius. Doesn’t take long before one of them has managed to get to his legs and bite him. He shouts in pain and slips down the stairs. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, that. Yeah, this big guy. I mean not like ogre big, but just human big ya know? Old guy too. (hic) I mean not as old as that asshole who own this place, but probably around my age.” <EOS>
<BOS> Although... <EOS>
<BOS> “Told you the plan would work as long as you got them in here.” Heather remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> ... <EOS>
<BOS> “Thirty gold pieces upon completion.” Dr. Gossey replies. <EOS>
<BOS> Even if she doesn’t necessarily believe everything she’s saying and is just hedging her bets that you aren’t cursed, she must REALLY be into you if she’s risking potential death. <EOS>
<BOS> While nobody is staring at you, you still feel a little out of place. You just never thought you’d be at a place of higher learning and attending someone’s graduation ceremony. <EOS>
<BOS> “FOUL FOLLOWERS OF FEL! LET TONIGHT BE YOUR LAST!” his voice booms and then suddenly several beams of light from the sky seem to target every Felian in the street, as soon as you see this, you tell your own people to find cover wherever they can. <EOS>
<BOS> You explain to Tom in greater detail about how this could be beneficial. Tom is still reluctant on this idea, but as Zal has mentioned several time before, Tom seems to like and trust you so he agrees to your plan. <EOS>
<BOS> “And that one’s Dreamweaver! He fucking killed them!” another exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> "Aw hell...you're right. She probably hasn't gone too far yet. Vaughn can you... What the hell is going on out there?!" You say suddenly hearing a bunch of noise outside the office. <EOS>
<BOS> “Will this suffice?” you reply and show him a few platinum coins. <EOS>
<BOS> While the Current Asset is the shadiest looking boat at the dock, you decide you cannot afford to sail on the Whisper at Dawn. Every coin will be needed for the journey ahead. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, this is the girl you chose, so if this is how you’re going out then so be it. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t usually, but let’s just say Jenny’s willing to go that extra step sometimes to gain access to the inaccessible. Under certain circumstances, you’d probably like her.” <EOS>
<BOS> She looks up at you with eyes mixed with hope and sadness. There’s probably a tinge of madness in those eyes as well. And from there your face moves in towards hers for the kiss and you shortly after that you finally consummate this relationship. <EOS>
<BOS> You have toured Inrit a few times just to see the sculpted gardens and the creatures that inhabit it, as it too was a place touched by your wife, but its beauty had been tamed and controlled, so it did not hold the solace you hoped. Still, it might be a good place to visit, now, as nobles have deeper pockets than the common man. While it might be harder to get noticed or draw a crowd in a place like Inrit Gardens, they would likely be willing to pay a lot more for an hour's entertainment. <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t sure if they’re going to regroup later, but there probably isn’t enough for them to do so at this point. Peter will probably have to abandon his plans of retaking his “birthright” and try again another day. Hopefully not anytime soon. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 33 <EOS>
<BOS> Normally you probably wouldn’t give Randi a second look, but it’s not like you have anything better to do and she’s probably going to be cheaper than a girl at an established brothel. <EOS>
<BOS> “You think it’s the Ebony Claw Syndicate?” <EOS>
<BOS> "This one does. Or at least he did before he retired. He makes a monthly trip from the Cloudpeake Mountains to Klyton because he REALLY likes the pastries from Stovo's Bakery. Buys up a bunch then goes back home. That's where we met actually." <EOS>
<BOS> He clumsily punches at you by flailing his arms backwards and even hits you in the face, but you don’t stop, you pull out the dagger and stab him again. <EOS>
<BOS> In some ways, it's a bit surprising that his plan works, and that you aren't caught. In others, it makes sense. It seems the merchants are not after you directly, per se, but that a few among them are drawn by the promise of coin from the mages in return for handing over the storyteller. They are trying to be as discreet about their planned crime as you are to escape it. <EOS>
<BOS> I do not expect you to discern. Instead, I will show you. <EOS>
<BOS> As you attempt to get up, Captain Rifiv is doing his best to hobble over in your direction. <EOS>
<BOS> “Guess I have.” Ardan answers. <EOS>
<BOS> When you arrive at the university you don’t have too difficult of a time finding where the ceremony is taking place. The university is very clean and orderly, you briefly imagine your father walking around this place back when he was going here. <EOS>
<BOS> And every single one of them died. <EOS>
<BOS> This is the man that was looking for you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Exactly. And if left unchecked who is to say they won’t find this place? Not to mention these assholes worship a dark god. The last thing we need is for them to do is gather enough power to start summoning shit. Last thing we need is demons running around down here.” You add. <EOS>
<BOS> “What do you know of the voice?” <EOS>
<BOS> Seth’s eyes narrow, gauging yours. “So it’s true then. You’ve returned. I wasn’t sure I’d be able to do it, but seeing you now, I know I must...for the sake of the man I once knew.” <EOS>
<BOS> After following the Shadow Blade through a series of halls and eventually to Rook’s office. He sits behind a desk with Bolt on his right side and slightly behind his chair. Rook is talking with another skinny man off to the side that you’ve never seen before, but judging by all the books on the desk, you guess that he might be some beancounter that tracks the accounts and such. <EOS>
<BOS> "Get out? Now? You're joking." <EOS>
<BOS> You didn’t plan on this, but it would probably be better if you didn’t cause a scene, so you, Garrick and his quiet friend all sit at table. <EOS>
<BOS> When you enter his simple place of business, you see a well dressed man with a goatee standing just inside the entrance flipping a knife into the air and catching it by the handle every time. He begins staring at you, but never stops flipping and catching his knife. <EOS>
<BOS> “Didn’t think you needed any help in that department.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Up? You’re already getting free fucking room and board!” <EOS>
<BOS> Seeing as you have nothing else to do today you decide to go relax for a few hours at the Unwavering Unicorn which is the only known tavern in Holgard that has managed to survive every form of major strife that’s occurred in this city. It wasn’t actually called that though until after this latest attack though. You guess the owner decided a name modification was in order. Makes a change from picking the usual unwelcoming violent names like Bloodbath Inn though. <EOS>
<BOS> “No? No what?” you reply. <EOS>
<BOS> So much for Empire territory being safe everywhere. Granted you are currently closer to one of its borders, but you’d think that would just mean they’d protect it a hell of a lot better. <EOS>
<BOS> “Great.” <EOS>
<BOS> So you’re not doing this for various reasons. Still, you have your concerns about getting out of here so you calm yourself down and address Flynn in a civil manner again. <EOS>
<BOS> “However I think you shall find that your prayers will go unanswered here. Neroth holds complete sway as he soon will over this city and eventually the world!” <EOS>
<BOS> As he gets towards the end of his tale he starts to sound a little better. <EOS>
<BOS> No sooner has Gloom made his announcement, a white light washes over the room and suddenly all of Gloom’s previously shadow cloaked people are now visible. Naturally Gloom just assumes this is just the effects of the orb, but he’s soon very surprised to learn that the Dornans have not lost any of their magic abilities at all. <EOS>
<BOS> “What did he do?” <EOS>
<BOS> The more you think about it, the more this makes sense in a ruthless pragmatic sort of way. <EOS>
<BOS> "Who's the stranger?" a priestess asks. <EOS>
<BOS> His lover put a hand on his arm. “Is it not for the best?” she asked. “Why seek to hold what should by nature be free?” <EOS>
<BOS> Whatever the reason, the mermaids are winning this one. You can't fight an underwater blowjob along with everything else. <EOS>
<BOS> “You don’t know shit kid. Staying on Reynolds’ good side is…” Tom starts to say before you’re interrupted. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure, what’s the catch?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well sis, whether things are working out for you or not right now, at least your exit wasn’t like this.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad to hear it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Not at all. You’re here so I figure you have something to say. Perhaps you can convince me of your worth.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you get the place you were going to meet you find that she’s not there. You wait around for awhile, but still no sign of her. You wonder if she changed her mind, then you wonder if she went in already because you also noticed that Reginald’s house doesn’t have the extra Holgard Watch security around it. (Rook was true to his word) <EOS>
<BOS> After a big of retracing and thinking, you and your people eventually remember the way back to Jicol and you’re breathing a sigh of relief since it truly would have been a silly thing to get yourself lost and killed in the wilderness. <EOS>
<BOS> “Marco actually.” <EOS>
<BOS> You silently acknowledge Rook’s words. While this is certainly going to help you out, you’re not sure if you’re going to be able to afford all these “favors” when it comes time to pay up. <EOS>
<BOS> This is probably the biggest risk that you are EVER going to take, or at least one of the most questionable ones. You can’t even believe you’re considering it, but given that Gert and the rest have the drop on you, it might be your only chance. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not give….argh.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Never,” you reply, still holding your defensive posture. <EOS>
<BOS> "A giant egg!" Ronin offers, then claps a hand over his mouth and continues in a whisper, "one covered in moss. And it glows." <EOS>
<BOS> What matters is Henry keeps his promise of enjoying sending you to a dark place because he keeps you alive a whole three days torturing the shit out of you before your body just gives out. <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, I guess because when I did it before I was really good at it.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm still boss of this inn and I'm boss of your fine ass." You say slapping Zal on the ass. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, the repulsive guy in charge of Yellow Devil creation and distribution and stinks of Yellow Devil fumes most of the time? There are already rumors going on about you fucking schoolgirl, I can’t imagine Camid is happy about that, still being her boyfriend and all. I’ve seen this happen before and it never ends well. So if you don’t want a knife suddenly in your back, like I said, you better straighten out this misunderstanding…or at least tell a convincing lie.” <EOS>
<BOS> You think again back to just a few years ago and the fact that you were part of not one but two criminal organizations. You didn’t give it too much thought at the time, mainly because you were thinking more about Tanya, but sometimes you wondered what it would be like to be running said organizations. <EOS>
<BOS> "Okay...so are we moving everything there then?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah, there you are. I was waiting for you and didn’t want to just surprise you by waiting inside your room. You know, you really should get better locks on the door. I’d think someone like you would know better.” The woman remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “How would you know? You’ve never left this town either!” your sister points out. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well I’m offerin’ anyway. I don’t even want dat big of a cut…” <EOS>
<BOS> "Heh, glad she survived. What about mom and dad?" <EOS>
<BOS> You leave Vaughn and head to the surface. You’re not going to walk all the damn way to the university though, so you pay for a horse and buggy to take you there. As you ride, you realize you haven’t really travelled around the city as much since you took control of the Crimson Talons. You’ve mostly been stuck underground most of the time. <EOS>
<BOS> "This inn that we run makes us a pretty good living and that's even before all the illegal shit like providing whores for the traveling merchants or running gambling games in the back. I mean aren't you getting tired of all this? Getting tired of looking over your shoulder thinking the Klyton militia is going to raid the place at any moment?" Zalmora asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Ludmilla’s palace might as well be impregnable. She’s using her own elite troops and magic to protect it, which is probably a mix of shadow and whatever she managed to learn from the Dornans before they got wiped out. <EOS>
<BOS> “Outlaw?” you question. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Mermaids." He mutters, but doesn't elaborate and just tells you he's got work to do. <EOS>
<BOS> The 75 silver to buy a horse when you land is a steeper cost, but one you are willing to pay. You stay the night in a simple Inn, and in the morning you are off again. <EOS>
<BOS> You try to keep an ear out for anyone that might be walk around, but it’s nothing but silence. You start to wonder if she came and left already or maybe this was all Sneaks idea of a practical joke. Wouldn’t be the first time. <EOS>
<BOS> “Perhaps, but you know those type tend to be very eager to prove themselves.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wha…how the hell did you even find me anyway?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> "You really made things interesting." <EOS>
<BOS> “Lady are you alright? We were watching over there and saw him getting too rough!” someone says, meanwhile someone else is still kicking you. <EOS>
<BOS> You can imagine his superiors are going to be upset, but it won’t be at you, it’ll be at him for fucking up a deal that they’re stuck with now. Well at least you hope they won’t try to re-negotiate immediately. You’ve bought yourself a little more time at least. <EOS>
<BOS> Everyone seems lost in their own world – unlike what would be typical in the town, no one is really greeting each other or even acknowledging that there are others there besides their own people. At points, it seems they are actively avoiding any interaction, crossing over to other paths or suddenly feigning interest in a plant or fish as another person walks by. It might be difficult to draw a crowd in such a place, even if you could compete with the exotic surroundings. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually though Ludmilla tells the pair of you that while she was pleased to meet you both, she has other guests to see, even though they probably won’t be as interesting you are. <EOS>
<BOS> Leave them to me. <EOS>
<BOS> She probably came back to help you, you can’t just leave her to struggle. <EOS>
<BOS> You get a few blocks away and sure enough, you hear her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…you might be right. Maybe we’ll be taking something else along with what’s in your pack.” <EOS>
<BOS> Expand outside Holgard <EOS>
<BOS> “AGH! Shit! Get off!” Klint’s father shouts as Annah’s dog has once again proven to be a vicious ankle biter. <EOS>
<BOS> “While I’m impressed that you’re thinking a lot more about this shit than most people here, I’m of the mind that for now, we should play more on our current strengths. We can diversify again later.” Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> “I could always cut your head off and let you decide.” <EOS>
<BOS> And if this man is indeed some ancestor of yours that means Keira is also! (You feel a little weird being naked in front of her now) It makes sense; she has similar traits that your sister has. Hell, now that you’re thinking about it, Keira does have a similar nose as her. <EOS>
<BOS> You wake up in a few hours and fortunately its still light outside. Probably afternoon by now though. After preparing yourself, you leave your room and find Claire downstairs having a drink with some merchant type. When she sees you approach she excuses herself and immediately goes to see you. <EOS>
<BOS> Despite the fact that death is most likely imminent, you’ve still got this unnatural attraction to Tanya, or rather genuine attraction, but unnatural due to the situation at hand. <EOS>
<BOS> Hank looks a little surprised by your hardened approach on this. You’re not sure why, it’s not like you two are good buddies or something. You’re his fucking dealer and he’s hooked on the shit you can easily get for him. <EOS>
<BOS> "Sure. Sure. Take all the preparations you need, we'll be here. And as usual, it's been a pleasure doing business with you." Mr. Reynolds says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, I am from a small town, but I may have had a little more fortune than I let on when we first met. Not much more though.” <EOS>
<BOS> After a few more moments of Grayhaze explaining when Kol should probably start actively training from the book and how you can assist in this manner, you take your leave. <EOS>
<BOS> “I sure hope so.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Naji.” <EOS>
<BOS> You watch a little boy play, a child you never had, trying to capture a frog in a jar. But then the boy grows older, and tips a hundred jars of frogs out as he laughs. The frogs mutate into giant chimeras, lion, crow, frog, and snake all mixed together. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay. Um, is there any transportation from here to Arcanius?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, we’ve been taking the fight to them, but the rumors are that they’re getting reinforcements from the Delantium Kingdom. Also, we’ve been having problems with cultists running around in the sewers.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm a servant of Peliandra and the wandering gods," the mage offers as you unpack. "She has blessed me with the Astral Arcanum." <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, that’s a bit surprising about Annah. She knows you better than you thought AND she’s still trying in her own way to defend you. <EOS>
<BOS> “What is your real name?” <EOS>
<BOS> You are then marched inside the prison where upon you and the rest are striped, hosed down, checked and given prison apparel. Your new “name” according to the prison is now 97P904. <EOS>
<BOS> “Should he have training so he doesn’t accidently blow something up?” <EOS>
<BOS> “What about dat magic girl I thought you waz with?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure you do, just not the one you want. Look, I get that this is going to be the hardest for you since you’re in a leadership position and you probably don’t like people telling you what to do and all I can say to that is well tough shit. You’re either going to have to suck it up or as I said, get the hell out of my way. Now if it’ll lessen the sting to your pride, I can say, you may retain some of your leadership role in a limited capacity. I’m going to need help in assimilating the rest of your people and the smoother this goes down, the better off we’ll ALL be.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well you can send your underlings to do it for all I care, but what I want is a free lifetime supply of alchemy supplies and the like. I know you’re a man of means so should be pretty easy for you. Again, I don’t care where you get them from, but I’m going to make a list and that’s what I want. And when I run out or need something else, I’m going to want you to provide it for free.” <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t sure what a blood stalker is and you still don’t even hear anything, but Warts never stops shouting about running for your life. He even turns his head to see if you’re still following and that’s when he takes a fall over something on the ground. <EOS>
<BOS> “No shit.” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh hello. Not many people even walk this way anymore let alone get this close. Last ones who tried were those silly Joachimites. They learned the hard way of course. So anyway, my name is Heather and what brings the leader of the infamous Nocturnal League here?” she says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Heh, well gotta say, I’m not used to this sort of professional courtesy from anyone before, let alone anyone from the Talons who were often telling ME to get the fuck off their territory whether I was working there or not. In any case, you’ll get no issues from me. Though I’d be careful fucking around in there.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Ah, quite a few of them I see. Henry really should have taken this job, he would have loved it, but there's no getting through to the boy at times. (Sigh) Anyway, yes Junior will have no problems with this. Probably can get it done tonight. Come back tomorrow and we'll have proof." <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” you ask slowly looking up. <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t even run as there is a barrier of fire blocking the exit. The best you can do is get off one more shot before Tanya is upon you and breaks your arm in two and then ripping part of it off. The physical pain is unlike anything you’ve ever experienced before, but perhaps it still pales in comparison to the inner you still have for a love that could never be and is now gone forever. <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sigh) Yeah sometimes spontaneity happens in magic. Look, just grab that top book on the table, turn to page thirteen and recite the words when I give you the signal. You won’t have much to do and it’s a simple enough task even for you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What?!” <EOS>
<BOS> A lifted stage lies in the center of the plateau. The structure is built to be a little smaller than the practice room mats. The stage stands several feet from the ground and has no railing. In each of the melee’s categories, if you fall, you’re automatically disqualified. You stand next to Kassi in the ready room, although it’s more a roped-off enclosure than room. <EOS>
<BOS> You walk down a street catching a lot of glances. Most of the inhabitants of this city are human (Though you’re seeing a couple of races that you’ve never even seen before) so you’re not standing out so much on that aspect, but the way you’re dressed is definitely cause for intrigue. <EOS>
<BOS> “It ends today and the faith of Fel will rule supreme in the city at last!” Gloom shouts and throws down the orb. A bit more dramatic than you’d expect from a Felian, but then Gloom’s whole attack tonight is a bit more theatrical than a typical Felian would go about this. Good thing too, since if he behaved more like his predecessors he wouldn’t be going in so recklessly like this. <EOS>
<BOS> You shake your head and move towards the group. <EOS>
<BOS> “Let me just cast a minor healing spell, you look like you could use it. Were you fighting before you got here?” Gwen remarks and starts casting something over you. <EOS>
<BOS> Later… <EOS>
<BOS> You briefly struggle with Rook and put another bullet in him, this time to his face, which certainly kills him this time. However your victory is short lived since it gave Bolt just enough time to reload and run over to your location and put a bolt through the back of your neck. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’d prefer it if you took less risks, besides if anyone was going to challenge your position you’d be dead before you even knew what was going on since I’d just poison your food and the shit would be over with.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You didn’t! I knew it! You’ve never supported me! Well as you can see I’m doing just fine without you, better in fact!” <EOS>
<BOS> That’s going to have to be a concern for later though. You can always steal more coin. You’ve had to start over again before, you can do it again if need be. <EOS>
<BOS> "Ivani?!" You clasp her stony hand. "Are you there, somewhere, inside? Should I have come before this?" <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” <EOS>
<BOS> In the months to follow, the Black Hooks do indeed fall in line and you’ve expanded the League greatly as far as membership is concerned. Of course there’s a lot of training involved, but thankfully many of them are quick learners after all. It’s also one of the major competitors out of the way and when you get better consolidated you’ll be able to move on to the independent folks as well. <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera, you need to seriously stop!” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> But you’ll never be free if you hang on to the idea of a relationship that can never be. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s not good.” You say and get the hell out of the Galpatis exhibit room. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! You know how I get! Please just don’t hurt me!” Annah begs and starts to tear up again. <EOS>
<BOS> You tell Shade that you’re going to try to meet with the Dornans. Shade sounds a bit surprised when you tell him but agrees that it is worth a try along with saying that they probably won’t kill you just for asking for an audience. (You sure hope he’s right.) <EOS>
<BOS> Finally, the officials announce the end of the Open Audience, and the Empress calls you forward once more. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why not? They’ll actually be perfect for this. Most of them either come here just itching to break someone’s legs or they go join the fight arena. Though a few odd ones join the Holgard Watch instead, go figure.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I couldn’t have done it without you, Seth. Your guidance kept me on the path, even when victory felt far away. I have no illusion that your part is equally, if not more, instrumental in the Empire’s defeat.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit! Get out of here!” you say, though your eyes are already drawn to this woman’s body, which is still covered up, but only by a very colorful form-fitting outfit. <EOS>
<BOS> "Fine job!" <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, that’s not happening.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What the fuck, Metzger. I thought you said this was an easy one.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I wasn’t even thinking about that…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Heh, suspicious type aren’t you? That’s a good quality. Smart. Yes, I may indeed have an ulterior motive…but let me ask you this first. Are you familiar with the shadowy arts?” <EOS>
<BOS> After finishing the bloody deed, you take a moment to catch your breath. You finally get a chance to be more aware of your surroundings and see Tanya has been making short work of the remaining cultists that have still stuck around. After finishing off the last cultist she turns to face you and once again you’re still a little concerned about as you have no idea if she’s actually still on your side again or she just decided to go on killing rampage. <EOS>
<BOS> The way you see it, you can either climb up the building to try to help Heather or try to help her students. <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re picking up what looks to be a flute sitting on a small table by her bed, you hear footsteps behind you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, this is something that’s been a long time coming and nobody who is a true follower of Fel should miss out on. Honestly, it was foolish to believe they wouldn’t be a problem. Shadow Master Shade warned me to always watch them you know, just before he died. A few of his interpretations of the faith may have been a bit too restrictive, but he had his own wisdom on practical matters.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya…” <EOS>
<BOS> “You okay?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Something like that…ouch!” you say feeling the aches and pains in your body. <EOS>
<BOS> So much so that you waste no time in standing up and pulling out your pistol with every intention of shooting Percy in the back. You know you’re going to be hunted forever by the ECS after this, but you don’t even care. They were imposing so much on your life anyway, you feel you have nothing to lose. <EOS>
<BOS> “The physical deformities you see and even the some you don’t pale in comparison to the mental scars I have along with the ongoing headaches and nightmares thanks to you and your wizard bitch. The Ebony Claw leadership in conjunction with the Temple of Fel spent months probing and prodding my brain to learn what exactly happened to me during my first trip here. I wish every fucking day they had just killed me for incompetence. At least then I would have died in ignorance. But hey, I’m not bitter and it’s all in the past.” <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you get to a big open field area with several seats and a stage set up. Others are already seated so you find yourself a chair in the back. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, that’s what I thought. Twenty years at Dreadcage. Next.” The judge remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m afraid so,” Kragan replies, “but all is not lost. Only half of the villagers are in the village. I believe that Mad Merodatch has taken the rest captive.” <EOS>
<BOS> Whether or not you can strike a good deal with Peter or not, there is one very personal reason you’d prefer to stay loyal to your current allies and that’s the fact that so far Heather is your only sure lead on getting fixed from your curse. If you backstab them and live, you’re still fucked because there goes a potential cure. It’s selfish, but it’s a pretty strong motivator. <EOS>
<BOS> “Looks like. If I was by myself, I’d probably just rest up here at the edge of these woods and walk through the night so as to continue the low profile…but since I know you’re pretty eager to get the hell out of nature’s embrace, we’ll continue along.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Go away!" <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh that. Well I haven’t made up my mind on that exactly yet. Don’t worry though, I have no intention on insisting that you teach me or any Nocturnal League members shadow magic or otherwise intertwine our two organizations. All I ask for is if there comes a day where I need a really need a big favor, I expect you to honor it.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “And as I said, stick with me and you’ll get richer than you are, now don’t anyone fucking interrupt again. As I was saying, I was having a discussion with a group that might be less willing to see reason than you lot, so I took it upon myself to take matters into my own hands. Hope none of you were into slaves, because the market might be closed for awhile.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Garrick, I’m not even arguing with you and I’ll be more than happy to leave this shitty Guild, but I’ve got to speak to Tanya first.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm. I think I understand your position now. You’re using this opportunity to ply your desired trade. That’s actually a reasonable mindset, if an unconventional way to go about it. I still have a few more concerns, but you can tell me more, just let me get my layout plans of what I’m envisioning.” <EOS>
<BOS> Zal smirks at your request. <EOS>
<BOS> Hours pass and when you wake up you find that it’s night time, still too early though. You stay your room a bit going over all your tools and equipment and making sure everything is in order. Eventually you decide that you’re going to be as ready as you’re going to be and leave. <EOS>
<BOS> To top everything off, you now have to abandon what you got going on here! <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay then, my fellows and I are going to finish our drinks and then get back on our way. Unlike you, we don’t have the luxury of an unknown reputation. Such is our burden in life. I trust you’ll want to get some rest for your journey tomorrow. Perhaps we’ll meet again in the future.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh right. That was a concern. Yeah I’m going, I’ll be there later. Don’t bother forwarding my arrival though; it’ll be a nice surprise for anyone I find slacking.” <EOS>
<BOS> You may have to, especially now, though your mind certainly went to a dark place during that time. <EOS>
<BOS> You try to shut your thoughts down and float after the dream. Elephants, madmen, monsters, and planets swirl past you as you dive. But the dream is broken. No matter how much you pursue it, it just goes deeper and deeper, until it's weaving its way through memories of your own life. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, well let me go address this new change to everyone.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Geez, didn’t expect dat.” Wartz says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sellin these figures. Found ‘em in da woods with a bunch of broken boxes. Probably somethin off a Caravan that bandits were tryin to steal from. Dunno why dey didn’t take these. Tried to use dem for barter with Spiderfangs, but dey dumb. Think these things iz cursed. Superstitious idjits.” Warts remarks and hands five figurines to Yinen who takes them. <EOS>
<BOS> “Go ahead, take some of that and celebrate with Naji or something. My cousin’s actually been missing you at the brothel. I dare say I think the girl had a genuine crush on you. Maybe you can get a new girlfriend to replace your demonkin one, but you know what they say, you can’t turn a whore into a housewife. Hah!” He says before dismissing you. <EOS>
<BOS> That’s all he gets out before you shove a dagger in his throat and kick him to the ground again. You don’t bother to retrieve the dagger as you see orcs quickly swaming the area, you just get on the horse and gallop away. <EOS>
<BOS> “True, but I remember something you said. We could all die randomly at anytime, but it doesn’t necessarily mean there’s any curse or greater reason behind it. Just means shit happens.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I detect no curses. Infernal or otherwise.” <EOS>
<BOS> At first you think one of your people saved you, but then the torches suddenly light again and there you see standing over you and Percy’s corpse is Toz in the process of removing his blade from Percy’s neck. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, let’s talk plain then. I’m handing over Holgard and ALL its holdings to you directly. That means you can take all the profits from here, influence shit how you see fit and probably do a much better job than I ever could. In exchange, you leave Jicol to the Nocturnal League.” <EOS>
<BOS> You get an idea. <EOS>
<BOS> “I see. Well that is a very important bit of information. I thank you for telling me, though it would have been more impressive if I didn’t have to initially pull it from you. No matter, give me the details and how you’re involved exactly.” <EOS>
<BOS> By this point Tanya has recovered and with how pissed she looks right now Reginald may be right on that last part. <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Simple question. Do you think you could take them both? I mean I’m not counting those idiots at the gate, they wouldn’t get to the fight in time before you or the other two were dead anyway. But without us here, it would be a perfect opportunity to assassinate them. True, they both weld a bit of shadow magic, but let’s be honest…they pale in comparison to a true follower of Fel. And if anything this life has taught me, it’s that anyone can be killed at anytime by anyone. Just need the right combination and the perfect time to strike.” <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, she’s apparently got a sweet set up for however long it lasts. Sort of wish you’d thought of something like that. You guess you under-estimated her resourcefulness. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s been awhile, but it’s good to see Vera again even if she’s just here for a visit. She’s got some strong opinions on some of the changes that have happened recently though. <EOS>
<BOS> “The Thieves Guild is one of the chief obstacles that stands in the way of my task. This relic of the past still holds on to their shortsighted archaic ideas and morals. Their antics bring unnecessary chaos, which is certainly something we don’t need more of in this city. Still, they aren’t complete fools as they have managed to hide within the city and we still can’t locate their hideout. Surprisingly even the ones we’ve captured have either managed to kill themselves or been dedicated enough that they have not revealed its location. I also am working with less than ideal resources available. If things were different…but…ah I get off topic. In any case, I am looking for alternative solutions. One of these involves you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “How did you know?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, you know. Singing tales, telling stories and getting into adventures…” <EOS>
<BOS> For whatever reason Tanya keeps popping up in your head. Actually more frequently that she has in quite awhile. Like when you weren’t with anyone you only thought about her briefly once every month or so. Now? She’s passing through your mind at least once a day. Sometimes more. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ve served under bad leadership, leadership that doesn’t listen or take advice from others. I promised myself I would be different.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Weren’t you the one that once told me once to forget about her?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Cursed? How?” <EOS>
<BOS> Honestly, you don’t know much about Dusk other than he’s significantly younger than both of his predecessors that took power. When he arrives you intend on expanding your knowledge on him and what his temple has been up to lately. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh well la de da, if it ain’t da duke of da undaworld.” Warts say. <EOS>
<BOS> You clutch at your throat and fall backwards off the carriage. You don’t even die right away, you gag, cough blood and convulse a bit. You even manage an attempt to get back up, but by the time Elana drags herself out of the carriage, you’re a corpse. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes, yes, of course I was. Sheesh, you act like this I'm some damn neophyte at this. I'm not worried about the fucking militia." <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, a Syndicate member paid me a visit recently. Said you’ve been dealing with them. Said you’ve been dealing with them for awhile now.” <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya must have ripped it out while you had your eyes closed from after she pulled the bolt from your back. You never felt her put anything in your bag though, then again you weren’t exactly paying attention. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fine. Get out of here. Go on back to your village or wherever you come from bard. And remember to sing the song of Peter Varsakken’s glorious victory here today!” the man shouts and give you one last shove before moving on. <EOS>
<BOS> Lorthander grips the staff and walks towards an angelic statue. Every other step sends an echo in the room, caused by the staff hitting the floor. Prince Ragar walks closely behind. At one marble sculpture of a seraph, Lorthander closes his eyes and speaks words of the incantation. The wings of the seraph, stretched out, close in as if preparing for take-off. The sculpture fades into nonexistence, revealing the staircase underneath. Lorthander motions for Prince Ragar to descend, and the prince confidently steps down first. <EOS>
<BOS> Whenever night starts to fall you temporarily get off the road and sleep in the fields behind whatever cover you can find though you never really sleep easily and are constantly waking up at various sounds. <EOS>
<BOS> You already know what Vera is suggesting. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re right. Let’s not worry about it. I said I’d go through hell for you…and well here I am and I love you for saving my soul.” You say and then lean in and turn Madeline’s head to kiss her on the lips. <EOS>
<BOS> Wendy isn't quite finished yet though and she grabs your arm before you leave. <EOS>
<BOS> "What else? Without stories, the hope is they will not persist, and will completely fade. Then dreams will return, and people can tell their tales again." <EOS>
<BOS> You begin cursing as your two underlings try not to anger you any further by staying silent. As you’re still wandering through the jungle you stumble upon a ruined structure. Looks like a temple and by its design it looks like one dedicated to Fel. <EOS>
<BOS> “But it’s our duty.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Uh, no not today. I wanted to speak with you about another matter…it’s about Jake.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course most of them just eat their off spring as soon as they give birth to them, but I told that bitch, no daughter of mine was going to be a snack. I’ll admit, I wasn’t the best father probably, but I think between me or being breakfast, well I think I’ll be vindicated once Madeline finds out the truth about herself.” Mr. Reynolds says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Agreed," you nod, understanding that there is no option to disagree that ends in survival. <EOS>
<BOS> “And I’ll just bet he wants you to go to sleep without the medallion. Tell you what, when you go to sleep tonight don’t wear the medallion.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So take off like a thief in the night then, I suppose I can do that. This is actually starting to sound easier and easier now. I’m just hoping that my meeting with the Syndicate goes well.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I wish you had shot at me instead, then you would have ended both of our torment when I ripped you apart for breaking my heart.” <EOS>
<BOS> The two knights beside him point their spears in your direction for emphasis. You eye them for a moment, then wave your hand. Dark missiles fire from your open palm, bursting through the heavily plated knights. They crumple to the ground with a clash of metal brought on by their armor. Their spears roll harmlessly on the ground away from their limp hands. <EOS>
<BOS> “Warts, they didn’t even see you, they only saw me, and I figured you’d be fine anyway. And look, I was right, you’re here to bitch at me.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> The ancient wizard Kragan Firehand stands under the painting of Medusa on a raised dais, while an equally ancient-looking butler sits at a desk to one side, consulting a strange compass and writing results in a huge ledger of some sort. Directly across the butler’s desk on the opposite side of the room, sits a beautiful young woman in small cushioned chair.  She seems indifferent to the meeting itself, quietly fussing over her nails with a small file. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thought that MAYBE I could even get some redemption for at least not dying with my friends years ago. Guess I finally get to make good on that now…unless you’re planning on selling me into slavery like you have with so many others.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So that’s the average Syndicate member, boss?” Marco asks. <EOS>
<BOS> When you finally get to Hessla, its actually a little nicer looking than you thought it was going to look. You expected it to be filled with run down homes with unsavory types located on every corner. If anything, the town has locations that are fancier looking than some of the better parts of Klyton. <EOS>
<BOS> “Won’t one of these divine beings eventually punish Ludmillia for her fickle nature?” you say mildly jokingly. <EOS>
<BOS> As for you, you decide to just look around to waste time. You grab another drink and try to stick to less “populated” areas of the palace. Though obviously you’re still limited to where you’re allowed to go. Guards standby keeping an eye on everything. <EOS>
<BOS> But first things first and that’s preparing for this invasion and how you’re going to go about it. <EOS>
<BOS> "A slug?" a boy next to her laughs. "How can a little, slimy slug find a treasure?" <EOS>
<BOS> "Have you been on any adventures?" <EOS>
<BOS> “You could have what Garrick? Tried to make everything better like you always think you can? This is what I was talking about earlier, you CAN’T FUCKING HELP ME! Nobody can! I mean just look at what’s occurred…I’m meeting this infatuated loser in his dreams and telling him my whole life story and I was only barely aware of some of it! How long before I have complete control over it? My infernal nature is coming out and it can’t be stopped. Stop trying to fucking save me because I’m NEVER going to love you Garrick or at least not in the way YOU want.” Tanya shouts <EOS>
<BOS> She nods and leaves the kitchen. Brother Samuel places his empty mug on the counter and heads to the outside door. This time, he walks upright without the use of the cane. The open night air stings Brother Samuel’s wrinkled skin. The full moon illuminates the surrounding grassy hilltops. Trees sprinkled on the slopes cast dark shadows, creating pockets of darkness. No bandit had come close to the monastery in years. Even criminals were smart enough to keep their distance. If they weren’t, they learned quickly. Subtle movement on the hill catches his eye. The night air suddenly felt much colder. <EOS>
<BOS> Wendy mentions your father's name and squints a bit as she looks closer at you. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, you’re not taking any chances. You need to get the hell out now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah. Interesting. I suppose divine beings go by many names though. Glad to know you weren’t one of those silly people that worships the emperor though I didn’t think you were really from Galpatolis since you don’t look like you are.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Well okay, but how are we going to do it? Camid just left with a little more than half the old gang. Besides us three, we only got a couple guys left and honestly I don't really have confidence in them if it's going to be a knock down drag out fight." <EOS>
<BOS> “You didn’t? But that’s what you told me to tell that big guy looking for you.” <EOS>
<BOS> "(Sigh) You know what the fuck I mean! All that high priced shit is easily accessible for the rich folks, but WE cater to the poor and who needs affordable distraction more than they do?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Probably in a couple days. You’re at the Laughing Devil right? We’ll just show up on the weekend. Tell your inn owner to be prepared for a large crowd. Larger than that place has ever seen.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Grm. Didn’t think so. You wouldn’t last in a real fight without dat shooter.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re half way down the stairs with footsteps and yelling not far behind. You then suddenly feel a force of a person grabbing and tackling you with abandon. The pair of you goes rolling down the stairs and don’t stop until you hit the bottom. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, that’s far enough. Who are you?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, unless you willingly do what she asks,” the wizard replies. <EOS>
<BOS> You and Vera spend a bit of time just looking around until Vera wonders if you should start actively mingling with some of the other guests. You’re of course against this idea, but you soon are forced into doing so anyway by someone you weren’t expecting to talk to, or at least not so early. <EOS>
<BOS> “She? Oh wait….” Rook chuckles. “Of course. It’s her isn’t it? Garrick’s little demonkin. This explains everything! Did you fall in love with her?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I have a realistic understanding of my abilities,” you answer. “Though I’m not prideful or short-sighted enough to believe I cannot be beaten. No man is untouchable, not me, not the Emperor.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Nah, Annie spoke to me about a few days before she stopped coming in. She didn't give that impression. The opposite actually." Zalmora remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> In between your new job and your concerns about your past comrade. You’ve also been thinking a lot about your family. <EOS>
<BOS> “…you…you…I…” Tayna starts to say. <EOS>
<BOS> As Vera sets out to follow your orders, you decide to go visit Yinen now while you’ve got the time. You’re sort of wondering what Yinen’s meeting is all about. Last time you saw him, it wasn’t under the best circumstances and he was ranting like a madman after his torture by the Neroth cult. Hopefully he’s gotten over all that. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’ll want to know then.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Um…I hadn’t planned to. I mean it sounds like you’ve got this under control on what to discuss. I think me being there is just going to look like we’re ganging up on him.” Vaughn says. <EOS>
<BOS> Sneaks snorts and chuckles. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah? Well they don’t need to like me, they just need to fear and believe in me. You forget, I was known as a Claw killer before I joined. I mean that should still count as a serious reputation.” <EOS>
<BOS> “They did with the inn. Actually I even worked for the man briefly before I joined the Talons, but that’s ancient history. Olaf is a big ass ogre who pretty much retired undefeated during his fighting pit days. He’s older of course now, but I don’t doubt that he couldn’t take care of Jake and scare everyone else into submission. Hell, he probably could scare Jake into submission too. He’d probably even do it for free or at the least very cheap. He really likes hurting people.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I'd heard there was trouble with the fire -" <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh you’re finally up sleepyhead. Given how long you slept, guessing you haven’t had that sort of loving in a long time. Not surprised.” Annah says. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re smart enough not to start a fight with an armored guard, but you’re starting to wonder if you’re going to even get in the city. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, not really boss. You know the Felians, they’re a pretty secretive bunch. In fact, don’t even know where they’re all holding out at actually now ever since their temple was directly attacked and partially destroyed.” <EOS>
<BOS> You consider your resources and options. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey handsome, you interested in another date with me? I’ll even give you another discount, you look like you’re still in pain.” Randi says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well you said you wanted to make sure the slaves we assigned there were being carefully supervised and all security measures were in place.” <EOS>
<BOS> "This is my final story, all I have. I give it to you all." <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t kill him, this infidel must be properly sacrificed! <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, so big guy in his forties was looking for me. What did he want?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Warts, you do what you gotta do, but I’m gonna do what I gotta do. Just remember whether the Nocturnal League survives or not, I’m still going to be here if you want to work with me again the future.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Is this the ‘protection’ King Aeric offers?” one of the younger members questions. <EOS>
<BOS> You open the door and you both enter where after mentioning something about your room, she goes into detail about the plan. <EOS>
<BOS> The crown’s been nothing but trouble and you’re likely just going to suffer more by keeping the damn thing. Not to mention you don’t really want to put up with its scolding advice again. <EOS>
<BOS> You now relax a little. Your worst fears are now over though Percy still hasn’t finished his story of revenge so you know SOMETHING bad must still be coming. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> You feel a punch to the face sending to back to the ground, but fortunately away from the pair of them. The two thugs ignore their companion still screaming with a dagger in his leg and advance on you again. <EOS>
<BOS> “So is the Baroness, though there is that bullshit rumor that she’s a vampire. She’s not though she just uses shadow magic to keep herself younger looking. If Heather hadn’t been such a purist for Dorna, she could have done that instead.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, well we've been through a lot together." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? Wait, you don’t have the fucking crotch rot do you?” she asks. <EOS>
<BOS> She also says that she will watch out for the ECS and will visit Holgard as soon as she is able and wishes you well in your new position. Nothing else is said. No personal thoughts on the new situation, just facts and explanations. <EOS>
<BOS> “I have to say, I wasn’t quite sure what to expect when the Syndicate sent me here, but I am a little impressed with what your organization has accomplished in such a short amount of time. You certainly have not just carved out this little island for yourself, but much of sea paths on this side of the world. You’re practically like your own nation.” Percy remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 28 <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m more concerned by financial losses, but better to take a big loss now than a complete loss later if we don’t help at all. Just wish there was another way rather than the slog that’s going to ensue. If we could take out this Inquisitor leader immediately, I would imagine the rest might lose some of their fight.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I already know about Joachim’s blessed light. You tried to tell me about it the first time I came here and you nearly threw up on me in the process.” <EOS>
<BOS> KILL THEM ALL <EOS>
<BOS> “Trust me, if THAT was your problem, you wouldn’t even be here right now.” <EOS>
<BOS> Instead of slamming you into the floor or something similar she instead throws you at Reginald who is taken completely off guard by this. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey Bruno, I’ll have a room. My old one if it’s currently available.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> the more likely Rook’s going to figure out why you’re really here. <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose in some ways I am.” <EOS>
<BOS> “…the Baron…was looking for all the allies he could get in his quest to take back what was rightfully stolen from him.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t know that,” you comment. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well for one thing, you’re Camid’s girlfriend and people are already whispering untrue rumors about us. I mean if you were just some whore, it probably wouldn’t be a big deal because…well whores are a whores and everyone is supposed to be fucking them. But you’re not a whore and you’re in a real relationship with another Crimson Talon. Stealing someone else’s girlfriend is just bad for business. It creates hard feelings and much worse.” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s funny how you never really used to think that far ahead before, but you suppose you’ve seen and done a lot since your simple days in Teckleville. <EOS>
<BOS> When the sound of snoring reaches you, the boy speaks again. "Hey, you still awake?" <EOS>
<BOS> You look around at the destruction of the brothel you’re currently in and try to temporarily ignore the loud chaos going on outside as you gather your thoughts on what to do next. <EOS>
<BOS> “Jicol is a port city on an island west of Hessla. They’ve got a large enough navy to fend off pirates, but as far as I know, they don’t really focus on their land based security as much.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey Annah I…” you start to say before being interrupted again. <EOS>
<BOS> You make your way to the Poison Blade Inn and along the way, you soon start getting hostile stares at various people. You’re definitely not in a friendly neighborhood. <EOS>
<BOS> “I can already tell how that’s going to go. A lot of attempts by the one in charge trying to convince me that they are an upstanding place of learning when it’s probably going to consist of a group little more than organized hedge mages or a large coven.” <EOS>
<BOS> They may be a small group, but this temple is where their magic is the most powerful. <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad you could make it,” Seth whispers. “There’s a window of sorts that’s our way out. Hope you enjoy a good climb.” <EOS>
<BOS> You and Zal wander around a bit looking at the inn. Eventually you go upstairs and find Zal looking through one of the rooms you believe is where your father and grandparents lived. There's even still a bed and some furniture still here. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya turns to you. <EOS>
<BOS> Since you didn’t even get paired up with a full fledged Guild member, you suppose you could just go gather a few associates to help you, though you believe you’re probably more than capable of performing the task yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> "I do not know. I only feel - I feel the stories and dreams rejuvenate me, little by little. Even your own tales, at times. Sometimes, a memory not my own will pass over me and refresh me like water. If we are to blame for this, then perhaps it would be better to destroy us than to let us continue in this limbo." <EOS>
<BOS> “Be that as it may, I know something is wrong.” <EOS>
<BOS> “History will not forget you, the fool who believed himself capable of possessing my power,” the Unbroken speaks. “I will make them remember as a cautionary tale. You may have convinced the people, but once they see me, and the true power I hold, they will discard you. You will become nothing. All this you built? It’s fucking mine.” <EOS>
<BOS> People have been suggesting it for years, but Jicol is finally under the grip of the Nocturnal League, meaning this entire island is under your control. If the Ebony Claw Syndicate sets foot on here now, you’ll be in a stronger position to deal with them. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fucking great. Your first words. Look, if we both get out of this alive, never tell your mother about this.” You say, and kiss his forehead. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t finish that sentence!” you shout. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s not what Mr. Dream said. He said you’ve been ripping off the Syndicate for years and just shuffling the book around or whatever it is you do. I don’t quite understand all that mathy stuff myself, but I guess you’re good at it, if you got away with it for so long…” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I thought they were the Crimson Talons.” Annah says. <EOS>
<BOS> You eventually get the story of a failed attempt at robbing the store in the night and apparently the one involved died in the explosion. Burned body parts were found amongst the destruction. You can only guess that was Zalmora. <EOS>
<BOS> You return to Vaughn with your decision. <EOS>
<BOS> Now, do you like riddles? I have three; each progressively more challenging than the last. If you’re game, you can try to answer them to win a Potion of Healing, a Shortsword, and a suit of Leather Armor respectively. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I’m fine son. And you don’t need to worry anymore either.” You reply and give him a pat on the head. <EOS>
<BOS> Zal and Vaughn walk off, leaving you alone for the rest of the night. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey cut out the noise! What the fuck are you degenerates doing over….oh what the fuck?!” Trobart says as he stands in the hallway just outside your door as you trying to exit the room. <EOS>
<BOS> Keira also tells you how to get to Arcanius though she doesn’t ask why you’re going again. Going by her directions, it’s going to still be a long ass trip, especially with no horse or other mode of transportation now. You don’t even have any supplies for such a journey though maybe Keira will give you some before you leave. <EOS>
<BOS> Your parents differed on speaking about their old home to you and your sister. Your mother sometimes would talk about fond memories in Klyton, but your father not so much. As far as he was concerned the best thing about the city was meeting your mother. <EOS>
<BOS> You start to wonder if you should have just left him! <EOS>
<BOS> “Sir. I understand your issues. Look, if you come here first thing in the morning, you can be one of the first to get served.” <EOS>
<BOS> You shoulder your pack and follow him back up to the deck. It's a chill night, made even colder by the mist from the sea. Clouds obscure much of the moon and stars. Even Sandman's shining trail is dimmed, tonight, and the only constellation that can be seen in full is the Maw, a dozen stars set in a diamond pattern, two bright ones near the top, with a fuzzy red nebulae between them all. It represents the throat and teeth of a dragon's mouth, and is generally considered an omen of ill-fortune when it is the most prominent constellation in the sky. <EOS>
<BOS> You hear a snort of laughter when you mention the ECS. <EOS>
<BOS> Surprisingly the inside of the building (which you think is Holgard’s hall of records. Some sort of government building anyway, you have no idea, never been here or paid attention to it before) isn’t too torn up by the fighting, though it looks like the people hiding here didn’t fair too well since you’re seeing a lot of dead bodies that look like they have the life drained out of them. <EOS>
<BOS> Reginald motions the two large men to open the cell door. You back up ready to fight, though Reginald shakes his head and makes some gestures with his hand and your body completely tenses up like you’re paralyzed. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hope its better than ass rape.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I hope so. Lastly I don’t give a shit what you your feelings were for your ex, you NEED to remember that she’s a fucking demon. So don’t fucking listen to ANY thing she says. You just let me take care of her.” <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Percy leaves the table and doesn’t pay any more attention to you. You can’t believe what just happened. EVERYTHING has just been stripped away from you and worse. This isn’t what you wanted and you all you can feel is that frustration and anger Percy referenced earlier. <EOS>
<BOS> “I know. We can talk about the next phase of the plan later, right now let us just spend relaxing time together. I know, tell me more about the little village you came from.” <EOS>
<BOS> About ten minutes in, you've worked yourself up into a frenzy. <EOS>
<BOS> It's hot, and dusty, even this early in the morning. You decide a change of garb is in order for the more tropical stretch of the journey. It's a bit of work to find a second-hand store, but finally you find a shop that lets you resupply on the cheap and trade in your own sorely used clothes. You step over to a dusty mirror to look over the new you. A simple blue linen tunic, with only a couple inconpicuous patches; light pants; serviceable sandals; a turban, an ikat pattern in indigo on white, possible turtles; and a buttery yellow long scarf, to keep dust and sand out, do little to hide that the reflected face has sagging brows and parchment skin. <EOS>
<BOS> “Is that right? I don’t see anyone else stepping up to do this fucking job!” <EOS>
<BOS> Two months later... <EOS>
<BOS> “Grhm. So youz tryin’ to get to Holgard?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wha…what?! That’s absurd!” Lloyd says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Heeeeey you…” Virgil starts to say. <EOS>
<BOS> The hat is – woefully light. 5 silver coins isn’t what you were hoping for. <EOS>
<BOS> "Very useful, keeping them alive so they can be used again." <EOS>
<BOS> As much as you might feel the urge to do so, you resist starting a fistfight. With a guy like Jake, it’s likely to turn into something a little more fatal and this isn’t like the situation with Klint. Jake isn’t just some loudmouth bully with a chip on his shoulder. He’s a real violent criminal and has loads more skill than you in a street fight. <EOS>
<BOS> You rise early, as you do most days. The castle is ablaze with news of Seth’s rogue party. They still haven’t returned, despite the sun starting to rise. Late raiding parties are never a good sign. A typical raid needs to hit hard and hit fast; a prolonged skirmish hardly ever works out for a raiding party. While you’re sitting cross-legged cooling down from your practice, a group of soldiers march into the training grounds. They part, allowing Mordecai to walk through. <EOS>
<BOS> “Annah!” you exclaim and walk over to her. <EOS>
<BOS> She sees you and she looks a bit surprised, but not overly so. <EOS>
<BOS> “My work for your father revealed another ritual, one that could give you the edge. Your blood, prince, the power within is not fully realized. I can unlock that power for you. Your father, the false king refused it. You are far more understanding than him.” <EOS>
<BOS> You will not lose sight of your goal! Ivani spoke to you. You have finally reached her, after all this time. How can you let her go again? <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, you run that new gang called the Nocturnal League.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Speak, vessel. You are not without value,” it commands. <EOS>
<BOS> The bandits take away all your weapons and your pack. When one of them opens it up, they’re thrilled with what they see. <EOS>
<BOS> “You got more than enough coin to buy all the nice things you ever wanted, and I know you have just enough skill to get by. It’s been fun and I’ll always remember the good times. Bye Annah.” You say and you shove Annah out the door. <EOS>
<BOS> “In any case, killing your parents that you never seemed to give a shit about and some old ex that you fucked as a teenager hardly seemed like revenge at that point and certainly wouldn’t have meant much to you. Now your sister on the other hand was a slightly different story. It would appear that you got along very well with her since most from Teckleville said as much. Partners in crime during your youth from what I heard.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I’m quite aware. <EOS>
<BOS> “No! Sheesh, you can’t tell that the kid looks like you? My eyesight is shit and even I see the resemblance. I’m saying Fel just provided a little magical or in this case divine assistance as far as the baby process is concerned. Your intimacy caught Fel’s attention since it probably was the first time in decades anything like that went on in the place. Why you might ask? Well because it’s a little known fact that Fel gets bored very easily and he probably did it just to amuse himself. Seriously, if most of the Felians knew what Fel was REALLY like, that would change the whole damn religion forever. Or maybe some of them do, but don’t care since it’s convenient to keep the hierarchy structure in place.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck it, you’ve been one of the few that’s actually been useful to me. How do you feel about starting something new?” Rook asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hi Gwen, ah no healing today, but I really do need to see Heather, is she around?” <EOS>
<BOS> Layla who has been standing nearby silently the whole time walks forward towards Kol who again doesn’t seem enthused until she takes his hand and smiles at him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why would that be the case? You’re rich aren’t you? Surely you can get some strings pulled and you could work anywhere.” You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, that’s what I said. Where do you see yourself and your gang in that time? What’s the plan? Do you have a plan?” <EOS>
<BOS> “You greatly overestimate my ambition and motivation to take on an organization such as the Syndicate.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you get down to the lower passages, you can sort of see their complaints, considering it’s like a maze down here. You nearly trip some of the traps yourself, but thanks to your years of skill, you avoid any injury (and impress some of these ex-Hooks all the more) <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well it certainly is a better reason than anything else I could come up with, and I’m not totally convinced that goal isn’t at least as possible as wiping out the ECS as a force in this city.” You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, a few sadly succeed. But I promised her mother long ago that if Madeline ever started to bloom that I would do everything possible to help that process along.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So what is it that the Syndicate wishes of the Nocturnal League?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> After spending a few more days in Holgard, Vera finally takes her leave and she’s gone again. You’ll definitely miss her being around, you hope the next time you see her it’ll be under better circumstances. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…I figured it might be getting close to dealing with that situation. Trust me, I HAVE been giving some thought to it, even though I’d rather not.” Tom says. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ll tell you what, you don’t need to be walking around here anymore period. You’re out of the Guild! You’ve been nothing a headache since I allowed you in here! I can’t believe I was so blind to think you would be an asset in the first place!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Mmmm…yes…I do…give it to me hard lover.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ay, I gotz a lotta people here. Aren’t ya comin ta make a speech ‘bout a glorious future or sumthin?” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Camid, I want every able body we have to look for Vaughn AND Zalmora! They didn't just fucking disappear and if the militia pinched them we would have known about it! I dunno what the fuck's going on, but if we got some rival organization like the Ebony Claw Syndicate setting up shop here, we need to get on this quick!" You shout. <EOS>
<BOS> He's practically an old man who is having a hard time walking with a cane. He's dressed better than everyone else on the ship, but that isn't saying much since even his fancy overcoat has patches sewn on it. <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re putting a vase aside, you suddenly hear something and you draw your pistol. <EOS>
<BOS> “We’re mounting an attack on the Neroth cultists because they’ve been fucking with us. More specifically, we’re mounting an attack on the Neroth cultists and going to make it look like Syndicate did it. We’re also going try to ally with them, though to be honest that’s the shit part of the plan.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm. I’m also still a little concerned about what you did with the Syndicate though. Might have been better in the long run to just pay their price.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure you are. And that’s why you’re here wondering what I might have to say to help quicken that wait time.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well I guess I’ll have to deal with that when it comes to pass.” <EOS>
<BOS> You wait until he’s almost upon you. The commander’s sword is arced back, ready to strike the killing blow for his leader. You stand, unmoving, at the threat in front of you, so long that the commander actually believes his blade will strike true. At the last moment, you spin to your right and swipe your sword out in the his path. His charge takes him full force into your sword, separating his upper half from lower. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes, yes," she waves airily, "but a storyteller, you say? Entertain us with a tale." <EOS>
<BOS> Still at a heightened state of alert, you stab at whoever it is behind you, and just manage to nick their arm with your own dagger before twisting away. <EOS>
<BOS> Gertrude breathes a sigh of relief and starts talking. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you secretly a son of Yag or just permanently blessed by him? Because there is no way one person can be so fucking lucky!” he exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well in any case, I gotta get the supplies to Grayhaze. Last thing I need is to piss off an old witch on top of everything.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, for all the good it’s going to do. Oh well, I’m at least getting out of here in one piece, and I’m sure you’re glad you don’t have to fuck a complete stranger.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Uh, no not really.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, well I guess better that she’s friendly now.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually after wandering a bit, you stumble into an area that seems more promising. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Luck? Got dat shit in abundance as long as I keep Yag’s faith. I suggest you do the same. An’ I’d also suggest dat youz just leave and not tell anyone else when da time comes.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Really?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well you always were an expert on shit Warts.” <EOS>
<BOS> This is going to be a mess hunting Sneaks and whoever else down here. In fact, you’re starting to wonder if Vera was right and you shouldn’t even bother being here. Especially with the Jicol Watch being involved as well. <EOS>
<BOS> No, the best thing to do is to keep a low profile and make your own way for now. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m sorry, but the fact you got caught like that is just hilarious.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well as usual, you can always leave Zalmora. You’re always bitching about what I do or don’t do. As a matter of fact, I’ll make the decision for you since you seem to be unable to. Get the hell out, you’re not a Talon anymore.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I’m not your dad, but here’s the thing, I AM in charge. From now on, the Nocturnal League is taking over everything and you can either be part of that, or you can get the hell out of the way. The choice is yours. What you don’t want is to be IN our way. Now I’m telling you lot this first because you’re closest thing to an organization in this city so you’re officially the biggest competition, as laughable as that is. You’re also getting the chance to join a REAL one along with better training for all your youthful activity that the law disapproves of. So, you with me or not?” <EOS>
<BOS> Of course they do. It would certainly be a strange break in the "theme" if they didn't. The drug bit concerns you though. <EOS>
<BOS> “Your son? When the hell did you have a kid?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re realizing this isn’t going well. Percy happily takes his drink from the barmaid. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thanks sis. And again, I’ve really missed you. Wasn’t sure if I’d ever see you again either. I mean I know I wasn’t…we both weren’t Joachim saints, but I think you can see I moved on to some rather hardcore shit. Compared to the simple pickpocketing and thievery I was doing before.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You think so? Either he has or hasn’t.” <EOS>
<BOS> "But I thought the whole point was to get away from doing shit like that. I mean I'm with you guys on going legit, but if we start making exceptions, we're not really changing are we?" Vaughn says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yinen?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “I guess not. Look I was told that you might be willing to let Olaf do some work for the Talons.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, must have been High Mage Thomas. He tends to like to speak for the rest of us whether we want him too or not. The man for some reason believes magic should mainly be used for altruistic reasons. The man might as well be a Joachimite Priest if he’s going to believe such nonsense.” The grumpy wizard says, but puts down his hands. <EOS>
<BOS> “What about you?” Seth asks. “Answer quickly, we haven’t much time.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Tell me a story," he begs. "Mum's asleep." <EOS>
<BOS> You never thought about it at the time, but only now do you remember Wendy mentioned she had three children. <EOS>
<BOS> And it’s not just one either, it’s a whole group of them. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well it’s a damn good thing that YOU don’t have to make the fucking decisions isn’t it then?!” <EOS>
<BOS> You take a suggestion from what Mr. Scars said earlier and try to imply you’re just a poor dumb kid that did something really stupid. The judge doesn’t look impressed. <EOS>
<BOS> Since it’s in your interest to not have Peter win, you’ve ordered Dusk and his friends to take out Peter’s wizards. With them out of the way things can go back to normal or as normal as they get here. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thanks, but I’m really okay.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “You seem surprised to see me, you were expecting me correct?” Teklis says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Hey boss, I just want you to know I'm not judging you if you did. We all have our own carnal desires and I know you seem to like the older ladies. I mean between Annie and Zal..." Vaughn starts to say. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, that’s retarded for different reasons. I’m going with my own idea. We’re going to hold underground gladiator matches.” <EOS>
<BOS> Several groups of the city’s watch attempt to stop you, but they give less of a fight than the Imperial soldiers. There is little resistance up until the keep. The main gate into the fortress is shut, and you can see lines of soldiers standing at the ready within the courtyard. Archers stand overlooking the fortress’ walls, firing down on your force as you draw close. You order your men to scatter into nearby streets to avoid being freely fired upon. <EOS>
<BOS> “Got dat right. Barely wanna do the shit I hafta.” Warts interjects. <EOS>
<BOS> A few more months pass and so far there haven’t been any issues with your arrangement and business is doing fine. The religious faction war is still going on, but you’re still keeping out of that one. <EOS>
<BOS> Warts begins to walk and you follow close behind. Several times you get the impression he’s going to try to run off, but it seems like he’s so reconciled to his fate. Almost like this has happened to him before. <EOS>
<BOS> “Could have settled this a lot easier, but take solace that your bad choices will not affect your son.” <EOS>
<BOS> "That should be fine - it isn't blockaded from this side. We can rent horses, if you like, and I'll go with you as far as the middle forest. I probably shouldn't be around much today, just in case the other merchants ask questions." <EOS>
<BOS> “We came to an understanding, yes.” <EOS>
<BOS> This is a shitty situation. You don’t want to leave Madeline, but you also don’t want to be on the wrong end of a bunch of violent demons. You aren’t equipped to handle it even with the resources you have at your disposal and you question if any of them would be of any real help if it came down to it anyway. (Besides Vaughn maybe) <EOS>
<BOS> “Why are you so interested in partnering up with me? I mean I get some of the reasons that you’ve explained, but this is still pretty damn sudden. I mean there’s still a trust issue here.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Again, I didn’t move in on her!” <EOS>
<BOS> This might even be more dangerous than trying to take out Rook directly, but you still think it’s your best shot. You probably still got time since for all her changes you know that Tanya’s probably still considering your last statement to her. Which means she probably isn’t going to attack Rook immediately giving you a bit of time to form a plan. <EOS>
<BOS> The torches go out leaving you in complete darkness again. You instinctively duck down and sure enough you hear the whizzing of several things, followed by the gurgling of the men near you in the corridor. One of them falls on you as you try to fire blindly in the dark towards the direction behind you. <EOS>
<BOS> The session is quite unlike anything you’ve ever experienced. It’s raw; it’s passionate and practically animalistic. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ll bet. So is there any place you wanted to go first?” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, this guy said his name was Yinen. Said he used to do some business with you…name sounds familiar.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You haven’t been here long. Don’t worry, he only takes the top warrior. You’ll be with us for life,” she answers. <EOS>
<BOS> You look at her dead serious when you say this. You actually don’t even know where all this is coming from honestly. It’s almost like you’re under a spell. The hooded woman doesn’t even acknowledge what you’re saying. <EOS>
<BOS> “I might as well tell you too, that Helena is also gone. Died in a house fire yesterday. I tell you, it’s been a tough time for this place lately, but hey we’re always here to please and there are still many lovely girls here. Hey did you want to see Naji? She’s free this time and it’s been years since you indulged in her services. I bet she’d love to see you again. Always said you used to be the best customer she ever had.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Heh, smart girl. In any case, I never saw in your mind that you killed her, so who knows, maybe if you ever meet her again you should hang on to her, she might just be the one that allows you to get over me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Heard ya yellin’ about a blood stalker. You still usin’ dat ol’ lie?” The hobgoblin asks. <EOS>
<BOS> The promise of loot is always a helpful push in any direction. <EOS>
<BOS> One is quite young - a little girl who mostly keeps to her room drawing pictures, pictures that shimmer and grow thin until she must replace them. She likes your stories though, and sometimes draws a picture for you that you duly hang up in your room until it vanishes. Did pictures always disappear? You can't remember. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not the average. They wouldn’t send their average. They send their more threatening to talk to someone like me. They also sent an extra one, which I guess means I’m really special. Lucky me.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> "How the hell do you even know her?" <EOS>
<BOS> “It is.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So where did you go?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Well, we could have use for that too. I remember once we raided a town that actually had a very tough safe that none of us knew how to crack. We couldn't even blow it open until we hauled one of the cannons off the ship and dragged it to the location. By the time we did get it open, the valuable contents inside were destroyed and the town had called for help from a more militaristic city that sent a strong force that chased us back to the ship. Could have all been avoided with someone like you aboard." <EOS>
<BOS> You wander the village a bit and are mostly met with stares, but nothing more. A few people actually have heard about you since news spread in this village fairly quickly. It’s mostly positive, since killing an orc is something to be celebrated here. In fact a few people are so nice they actually give you some free food. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, you never in any true danger. Even if you had gotten wounded we could have easily fixed you up with healing magic.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’ve been busy during your stay here in Holgard. Pick pocketing, burglary, and all those other activities that are frowned upon by the law. Not to mention all the Ebony Claw members you’ve been murdering. So tell me, do you feel that you can just rob this city blind and do as you please?” Rook asks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, too bad I'm not on good terms with my dad. I'd actually send a letter home to thank him for being such a good guy. Have no idea how the hell we're related sometimes." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You close your eyes and draw your sword, shouting and hacking wildly. <EOS>
<BOS> It's all the excuse the militia needs to start running you through repeatedly with their spears and swords and stomping your head into mush. You're a holey bloody mess by the time they're through. It isn't exactly the most pleasant death, but at least it eliminates all the waiting. <EOS>
<BOS> “WHAT?!” you exclaim causing Layla to cringe in her chair, but your attention is towards Kol. You immediately start interrogating the boy and her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Didn’t think you’d be interested given how youz got yer mind on other things. Got a daughter too, Zuggins. Twins actually. That’s another reason why Snuffit wuz so pissed at me. Hey, didn’t youz say you were a twin?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sounds like you’ve got that under control. Um, can I stay here the night and look over these plans and this map of the sewers? I really want to get started on working on designing a new layout and where the best location would be for your headquarters.” <EOS>
<BOS> Fights are pretty common, though they aren't necessarily always to the death like you'd expect. Just a lot of disagreement and drinking make for a rowdy town. So far you've avoided pissing anyone off and kept a low profile. At first you aren't sure if you're actually going to stay here for long or not, but on your fifth night you have another dream of Madeline. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why not? What else are we going to do, get real jobs? Besides, things are actually going a little bit better than they were with Edmond. Tom’s not likely to start executing folks over small mistakes at least. Plus in this line of work it’s a lot better to have a few people watching your back. Now how about we stop all this talking and go to your room where you can watch my back up close?” <EOS>
<BOS> "I am glad to see you again, as well," he says. "Order anything you like, my treat. I won't have many expenses for a while, now that my official enrollment has been accepted." <EOS>
<BOS> “An howzat workin’ out? Doesn’t look like yer doin’ all that well if yer still livin’ here. If I had ta guess, youz still small time.” <EOS>
<BOS> Of course as soon as you come in, your mother sees you with blood on your clothes and demands to know what is going on. <EOS>
<BOS> “If he is, I hope he does better than he did for his loyal worshippers. Just wish I had something more than this pair of dried unicorn balls as a possible offering...Warts are you even sure this shit is magical?” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> The odor of Virgil’s rancid breath hits you full force. You immediately cover your nose and mouth. <EOS>
<BOS> “You don’t! But if you don’t start talking, I’m going to keep you alive for years to torture on general principle! Each day will be a living hell and you’ll be praying to ALL the gods for the merciful release of death!” <EOS>
<BOS> You turn your attention to Toz. <EOS>
<BOS> It finally happened. It was only a matter of time. King Aeric’s castle was finally taken by the Emperor. The rumors speak of a squadron of wyverns leading the assault. Wyverns! They were supposed to be extinct. The Empire is a great beast and nothing is out of her reach. Seth was right. If you had stayed in the castle, you would be dead along with King Aeric and his men. Not that you had a choice in the matter -- Aeric had banished you, after all. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh no, not me! Never would I challenge your insurmountable wisdom boss. Obviously you’ve got things under control more than little ol’ me could ever handle.” Zal says with obvious sarcasm in her voice. <EOS>
<BOS> “It is?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh he's doing well. He's a doctor with his own practice in a smaller town, but he's happy." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> The staff burns warms in your hands, burning to be used. You try to fight its pull, but your resistance is half-hearted. Even Ivani, your precious love, has told you what must be done. <EOS>
<BOS> Suddenly Teklis waves his hand and everything seems to slow to a crawl and the room begins to darken. You instinctively go for your pistol, but every move you make is a snails pace compared to Teklis who is now directing his hands towards you. <EOS>
<BOS> Two men enter the room wearing mage garb. One wears the crest of a Master Mage, the other a Journeyman. "He's awake," the master says, "bring him below." <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe not, but I can’t take this feeling any longer. My plan was similar to yours, but apparently that hasn’t worked for you either. We might as well alleviate the pressure and have some fun. And at least I’m not going to feel too bad about fucking a complete stranger as long as it’s a one on one deal.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe my feelings are genuine, you ever think of that?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh yeah. Eh, I think maybe we should stay married for now, just in case something pops up. We can always do it later, right now there's other stuff that takes priority." <EOS>
<BOS> “So you’re saying we need more protection on all of our interests. Well that’s great and all, but we don’t exactly have that many more people. Any extra we do have are protecting this place.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You know me. I like my rest,” Seth answers. “What of the shaman? Is he dead?” <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re mentally preparing yourself for this assault in your head, Warts is still around asking you questions. <EOS>
<BOS> You immediately leave and call for Marco who arrives shortly. <EOS>
<BOS> Niro fled as the eggs were crushed, following an inner scream through the trees, scrambling up the rock and soil and underbrush to a boulder overlooking. They were setting the Court on fire, the magical place was burning! <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, I’m not the one you have to convince. I’ll leave you to it boss man, I mean we all know you’re the one who runs everything here.” Zal says and leaves. <EOS>
<BOS> “There’s no time to argue, girl! Let’s go!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Heather, what the fuck! This is really fucking hurting! Get the hell off me! FLYNN!” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m sure he’s not invulnerable. Peel away all that protection and I’m sure he bleeds like everyone else. It’s just getting through it, that’s all. As much as I’m loathed to admit, your help WOULD probably go a long way in the Joachimites’ eventual defeat. For one thing they aren’t expecting an attack from your group. Set it up right and you could probably do a lot of damage with your first attack. Be prepared for the retaliation though, because it will be fierce. Hope you’re ready to take some personnel losses.” Shade says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, sure it’s just past those buildings over there.” Someone answers. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re the boss.” She says and leaves. Vaughn just wishes you good luck with your meeting with Madeline and follows Zal. <EOS>
<BOS> "But it's millions of stories," she says, "and memories, and magic, and art, and dreams. Where will it end?" <EOS>
<BOS> It’s unwise to attack your healer. <EOS>
<BOS> “You need medical attention or something? I thin we’ve got someone with some minor skills in that field around here.” You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> You stand up. <EOS>
<BOS> “Trust me m’boy if you had demon crotch rot, you would know immediately and we wouldn’t be having this pleasant conversation. No, you don’t have anything. I mean I can’t explain why those women died after you had sex with them. Maybe it was just bad coincidence and you jumped to conclusions because somewhere in your mind you missed Tanya so much and it was easier for you not to pursue someone else. If you got a curse, it’s just the one you made up in your mind.” <EOS>
<BOS> And at least you haven't encountered any mermaids you guess. <EOS>
<BOS> “You will not take everything I’ve built! I created the Empire and it’s only through me the free lands have been conquered,” the voice behind the mask shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> “Who?” <EOS>
<BOS> "How is your schedule?" asks the other. <EOS>
<BOS> You run over to the captain and block the charmed crewman's sword with your own, then you follow up with a thrust with your dagger that's in your other hand. It sinks deep into the assailant's chest and as he slumps to the deck, you help the captain up. <EOS>
<BOS> Business is going well now thanks to your better locations. More people seem to prefer gambling in an area that smells tolerable for one thing. Madeline also had the goblins build a hidden entrance way topside so folks can now enter directly and not have to muck about through the sewers. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, you mean the one about creating a new criminal empire and joining you? Uh…well do I really have a choice?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, I figured while the Syndicate isn’t making a direct threatening presence, I figure they might still be snooping about and trying to stir up animosity between allies.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Where will we go?" you wonder aloud. "Anywhere in the world we please, I suppose." <EOS>
<BOS> You look at Kol and you look at Grayhaze and you can’t help but have more questions. <EOS>
<BOS> “I trust you realize that I was just defending myself during the chaos.” Toz says. <EOS>
<BOS> While most of your small town is fully aware of your roguish ways, you’re fortunate that you’re both still young and your father is a good doctor and has some measure of influence in keeping you out of the local jail. Plus, it helps that you long since stopped stealing from the town itself and focused on stealing from people passing through Teckleville instead. <EOS>
<BOS> His chariot crashes spectacularly into the shield wall, breaking through and trampling several of the soldiers. The boars and chariot aren’t in the best of shape either of course, but that doesn’t matter since the leader has already jumped off it and begin chopping people up directly with a huge axe. <EOS>
<BOS> When that day comes, the rep doesn’t give you much argument about it and states that he will report this to his superiors immediately since he’s sure that they will be very interested. He anticipates that you will probably get a message for a meeting time soon after he reports to them. <EOS>
<BOS> Well that’s the ideal plan anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> “Magic is a very handy thing to be skilled in when locating someone. I’ve been meaning to see you for a while now. In fact I was coming to see you today and I’m glad I caught you when I did since it seems like you’ve been meeting with others. Like that man from the Syndicate.” Heather remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “You deserve this.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> After forty five minutes of observing the chaos around you and waiting, eventually the Mayor of Jicol is presented before you. He’s about as unimpressive as his title. An overweight older man with spectacles. On the paler side of things, which makes sense given how reclusive he was. Obviously more of a planner and bureaucrat than any sort of fighting ruler. <EOS>
<BOS> “Checkers attack!” you hear and this is followed by growling. <EOS>
<BOS> “No I can’t imagine we will be. Do we need to clear furniture for you to make a circle on the floor or something?” <EOS>
<BOS> “We have! Um, we’ve managed to save couple of our brothels from getting too fucked up. We’ve also been having people take the whores back to headquarters and stay there until it’s safe.” <EOS>
<BOS> You point your pistol right at Sneak’s forhead as he looks up at you. <EOS>
<BOS> And at least you haven't encountered any mermaids you guess. <EOS>
<BOS> Another false king sits on the throne. The Emperor has spread rumors that he is Unbroken. He’s not, I can assure you of that, even if he desperately wants to be. I am bound to the throne. I am bound to you, the true ruler. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t even want to hear it.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. Just tell them to come to the Blackheart Inn, where I’m currently staying by the weekend. That should give you enough time to scout the streets, taverns, and wherever else. Oh and let them know that the drinks will be on me, so that should help entice them as well.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Hm, well I suppose if he gives us any shit, we know who he's already afraid of. You said he had a sibling, what's the story on that one?" <EOS>
<BOS> You return to the cabin, and the woman opens the door for you this time, practically yanking you inside. <EOS>
<BOS> “He’s fucking dead?” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> The Stronghold was built and used by dwarves long before men came into the area, but was abandoned when the dwarves migrated deeper into the mountains. It is an ancient place, but very well built, and easily defended. This is where I sense the power of The Oblitterum Nomeno and where Mad Merodatch would have taken any surviving villagers. You’ll find them there. <EOS>
<BOS> And then you get the idea. <EOS>
<BOS> Might have been one of those Bloody Talon assholes, though honestly you’re a bit surprised that they haven’t shown up here before. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya, wha…” you utter and then get another fist in the face causing you to crumple. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well gee boss, why don’t you get your precious hobs to fucking do all this shit?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, she’s been taking her self appointed title of Countess a little too seriously lately. Acts like she was born in a palace made of gold with only the finest silk to wipe her ass with. I still love her all the same mind you.” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> “Will you keep your fucking voice down? There are soldiers crawling all over the sewers right now and you’re calling attention to our location! And as I said, I don’t have anything else to say to you. It’s obvious you’ve never appreciated my advice, so I don’t see why I should waste anymore time with you.” Vera snaps. <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re telling the story, the sergeant begins to look a little concerned. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, you still don’t look that great. Look, you’re barely in any condition to walk anywhere let along travelling all the way to Arcanius. Why don’t you come back with me where you can at least rest and heal up? I mean as I said, you did help me kill the orc. My village isn’t that far away.” <EOS>
<BOS> Seth’s right fist meets the Captain’s jaw. The woman screams, revealing the fact that she knows Wren. <EOS>
<BOS> “So, you were sent by the Fel leadership to deal with yet another criminal group. Yeah, I can see where that would piss you off.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Do you know where I could get some qweepas?” you suddenly ask the barkeep. <EOS>
<BOS> “I need someone to go into Hessla or around that area with my assistant and get me some live specimens. About ten should do. Like I said, I’d send my assistant alone, but I know how dangerous Hessla is especially for a single female, so it would be better if someone went with her.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Mad…” you start to utter before she puts a talon to your lips. <EOS>
<BOS> Warts gives you some directions and then says it probably would be best to meet him there around midnight since he says he’s seen this Reginald person leave at night and stay out until dawn. Sounds more like something you do, but if he’s not going to be there then that’s when you need to be there. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well that's tough shit." <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” <EOS>
<BOS> You can imagine that if this was anyone else but the baroness, Heather would be igniting her on fire for her words since Ludmilla’s coming off like she’s just as knowledgable about magic as Heather is. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not sure about Vera, but Kol is definitely safe.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh definitely. She'd feel like she would be a real criminal working for a dangerous organization and all. She'd do it for free too, not like she needs the money." <EOS>
<BOS> For now though you decide to get some sleep after your long night of thievery. As your lids get heavier, you think on where you could ply your trade with a little more ease and a lot more loot. The rich areas are well patrolled, the government district is well patrolled, the merchant district is well patrolled and has Bloody Talons running about, and the poor areas are definitely Bloody Talon territory and the folks don’t have shit. <EOS>
<BOS> The next morning you wake up and you head over to Mr. Reynolds' place. You notice a lot of Klyton militia patrolling about. You also come across a young boy with a bunch of papers shouting about a vigilante. <EOS>
<BOS> Right now, the most pressing concern is gaining coin for your journey. A typical crowd haul of five or ten silver isn’t going to contribute much, but the stranger looks like she has a deeper purse to pull from. <EOS>
<BOS> Then again you did throw her out… <EOS>
<BOS> “You were just what? What were you doing Warts? Fixing the table leg? Counting the number of nails in the wood? Having an out of body experience and travelling a different plane of existence? You talked me into doing this job and now I find you in no condition to do anything.” <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t sure if you should be talking, so you don’t say anything. <EOS>
<BOS> When you open the door, the room is nothing special. It’s not bad, just nothing that would stand out to think this is a good one. Still, if this is the best room, it’s a good thing you didn’t get one of the lesser ones. <EOS>
<BOS> You probably would have broken your neck had Vaughn not been in the way to break your fall. Of course you probably surprised the hell out of him as he was climbing down the ladder. <EOS>
<BOS> After getting something to drink, you muster up as much energy you can to get around to dictating orders for everyone today, though you end up letting Vera taking over those duties for the most part today while you’re still recovering from yesterday. (Which she’s happy to do) <EOS>
<BOS> You stand up in the cart at which point several soldiers tell you to sit back down and begin pointing their spears in your direction and closing the gap. Mr. Scars just smiles a bit sensing what you’re going to do. <EOS>
<BOS> But where is Ivani? <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh? Oh yeah! Yes, it was good. There were definitely times where I thought I was with…well someone else.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re not kidding. I mean I’ve always been a bit of a free spirit, but I like them one at a time, not as a mass of bodies.” Your sister says with a bit of a chuckle. <EOS>
<BOS> “Mm, I like to think at least ONE of us would stop her before it got that far. Look, I think you might be overreacting, but I suppose it’s always better to be a little cautious on these thing, so I’ll have a talk with Kol later about Layla and explain how things need to be. Don’t reassign her though, I mean she’s still doing a good job otherwise.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Dunno, some humie bandit that attacked and tried to rut with her in the forest. Me mum said it was dark and he seemed pretty surprised when he realized she wasn’t another human. Mentioned he tasted like cheap beer after she was done wit him, so I guess he liked to drink.” <EOS>
<BOS> It's a bit macabre for your tastes, but why not? The feast has put you in a good mood. "Thank you," you say, unsure how one accepts such an offer, if it can be called that, and gently slice your palm with your knife. A bit of your blood pools, drops, and hisses into the wine. <EOS>
<BOS> "If she enjoys the story, I will be sure to mention you all," you nod, and spend the next ten minutes thinking on the story itself. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, you might be surprised how dull day to day life can still be for a tyrant. Still, I’m sure there will be more than a few bits that will interest you. Some of which happened before I became one. I warn you though, it’s a long story.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Another man, wearing the same colors as Seth chimes in. “Still, we must not act too hastily. If surprise is our best ally, we’d be foolish to squander it at an inopportune time.” <EOS>
<BOS> “The rightful Baron Peter Varsakken has half of your payment ready. You will receive the other half afterwards as agreed. If you follow these men, they will take you to it. Your men will stay here.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well, then. Follow me.” <EOS>
<BOS> If you have a chance to take down the Joachimites in an expedient manner then you’re going to take it. Last thing you want is this to drag out any longer than you have to. <EOS>
<BOS> You begin to go into detail about the Thieves Guild and it’s location. You also mention you already killed Garrick and Tanya which is why you left. Rook’s eyebrow rises at this revelation. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yinen! It’s me! I’m not one of them! I’m…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well I imagine there’s a hidden trapdoor that we haven’t uncovered yet. They’re probably either hiding underground, or maybe even escaped through a tunnel.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, this isn’t working. Fuck what if its permanent?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ardan! Hold on! I’m coming!” you shout. <EOS>
<BOS> “Damn it!” she exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> “You have the balls to ask that? You know what the fuck you did! You’ve been talking with the Syndicate!” <EOS>
<BOS> After another uneventful walk through the sewers you get to the Yellow Devil Den. For obvious reasons you don’t come here that much, because the place stinks worse than the rest of the sewers and always has junkies hanging around, acting crazy or just slowly melting. Though the melting is a little less now that Camid’s made strides in cutting Yellow Devil with less lethal ingredients and still managed to maintain it’s feel good effects. Still doesn’t make you want to stick around though. <EOS>
<BOS> “I believe it is possible, however you’d have to undergo a ritual first.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ve crossed paths with a shade and—” <EOS>
<BOS> “What?! NO! Klint stabbed her, but everyone thinks….look… I gotta get outta here, just go help her!” you say and push both of your parents out of the way to go gather a few things from your room. <EOS>
<BOS> “She’s always been a stubborn one. Devoted, but stubborn,” Brother Samuel comments. He kneels down beside her unconscious body and closes his eyes. After uttering words you cannot comprehend, he places his palm on her forehead. Blue light softly glows from the small crevice between his palm and her head. Her eyes burst wide open, and she sits up suddenly. <EOS>
<BOS> This asshole’s not even negotiating anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> “Truly? Grm. Well it’s up to you.” <EOS>
<BOS> You, Vaughn and Zal head to the arena. Along the way you notice that the rough tunnel is sloping downward. Vaughn says that Rob really wanted to impress you since you gave him a chance and in order to do that he needed to expand downward a bit to create the fighting arena. <EOS>
<BOS> As you get to the front door of the palace you see Baroness Ludmilla standing nearby saying goodbye to all her guests that are staggering out. The baroness doesn’t look any worse for wear. Either she didn’t drink what everyone else did or she’s got amazing recuperative powers. When she sees you, she waves you over. <EOS>
<BOS> A few days later, you sit once again in the Captain's cabin. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tell me more about…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wha? You’re back. How long was I asleep?” Vera asks rubbing her eyes. <EOS>
<BOS> As for Tanya, well you’re going to have to just cut your losses you think on that one. It’s obvious that isn’t going to work out and you need to accept that despite how you might feel. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course NOW Virgil decides to be uncooperative. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora nods her head. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey handsome, what’s going on?” she asks a bit flirtatiously. <EOS>
<BOS> As Vera starts walking away from you, you realize that you have no more organization and no more followers of any kind and oddly that’s what feels more like a loss to you than the massive amount of coin. You were actually stating to just get into your role as an underworld boss and now its over already! <EOS>
<BOS> “No. She probably didn’t, but I made a pragmatic decision because I needed something and she was the best way to get it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh?” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s a long walk back home and you’re thirsty as hell. Probably dehydrated from all the wild sex you had. Along the way you stop inside a tavern and order a drink. Nothing alcoholic this time though. <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t say you were, but you used to be a little more fun at least. Like those first few years when you got here. Remember?” Zalmora says with a bit of a smile. <EOS>
<BOS> “Calling what?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Dada!” Kol says. <EOS>
<BOS> You leave the Lighthouse and head to the Poisoned Blade Inn which is the well known Ebony Claw hang out in the city. Granted you don’t know if Rook is actually going to be there, but given that’s the only way you can think of to get into contact with him, that’s where you go. <EOS>
<BOS> It is the classic call of a storyteller, and has its effect on the crowd. Soon dozens of people are headed over, as well as a large mass of children. Some sit, some stand, but all look at you with the unspoken question: why are you dressed that way? <EOS>
<BOS> “He’ll be back in a moment, then we’ll proceed from there.” He says and then motions for the ones holding your arms to let you go. They don’t give you back your weapons (or the bag) though. <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile you’re getting increasingly agitated with the fact that Percy still hasn’t been found. He could be anywhere. You even order searches of the deeper jungle areas, which doesn’t do much except get some of your people killed by dangerous wildlife. Even if he was hiding in the jungle, they probably wouldn’t find him anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> Seth was not a father figure, at least not in the same way I viewed Brother Samuel. With Samuel, I could tell he had my best interests in mind. Seth’s motivations were unclear, though they mostly revolved around himself. I wonder if his influence guided me to a better path. If you do not understand the influence others have on your actions, you are like a ship without a navigator. I studied the actions and motivations of those around me and introspectively meditated on their affect. I do not allow impurities into my system and that includes the impure actions of others. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I can see you got a lot to think about. Whatever it is you decide to do isn’t going to matter to the ECS. So kill her if you wish, there’s probably someone even more pliable in the Nocturnal League that’s more than willing to continue working with us. If I were you though? I’d do something worse than kill her because as you can see with me, there are worse things than dying.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hello old comrade, as for what happened to me, that’s a long story. First though, come on in and let me say I want to apologize for attacking you that day you saved me from that wretched cell.” <EOS>
<BOS> “This group is a little different.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Is such a thing even possible?" You clutch the edge of the bunk, knuckles white. "The muses are friends to humanity, they would never do such a thing!" <EOS>
<BOS> “You know you’ll get warmer quicker if you get your clothes off. Those are going to need to dry properly anyway.” Keira says. <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t even come up with a good lie though it doesn’t matter since Tanya isn’t really in a mood to listen, let alone believe you. She grabs your neck with one hand is slowly crushing your windpipe as you dangle off the ground. Her eyes are even giving off a faint reddish glow, it’s like you’ve unleashed her demonic side. <EOS>
<BOS> “And for the record, I don’t go around killing people for fun. I’ve only killed one and that’s because the sonofbitch stabbed my girlfriend.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> A couple days later Vaughn brings in a man with a lot of messy hair, raggedy clothing, a full beard and mustache and red nose. He also has a few bruises on his face. Must be Rob. <EOS>
<BOS> Then again, there’s no certainty that Peter’s even going to win, assuming he even invades in the first place. It would be pretty wasteful to just abandon everything you built here. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit…this isn’t going to work. We can’t both stay here, or least we can’t both stay here and not be fucking each other. To hell with it…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Last message I got from her she said there weren’t any problems. Even starting to recruit a few of the locals there, which is good so we don’t have to send any more people from here. Not to mention the profit she sent last month was the biggest yet.” <EOS>
<BOS> As for you, you’re in the middle of a wood, still wearing your bloody clothes (fortunately you managed to grab some spare in your pack though) unsure of where you’re going to go exactly. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, no, nothing like that. I just need you to relay a message. Remember that big guy looking for me?” <EOS>
<BOS> You might as well explore all your options and you really don’t feel like being intimidated. You’ll just pick your most competent agent and tell him to be extremely careful and to not linger there anymore than he has to or he’s going to suffer a horrible fate <EOS>
<BOS> You take a brief walk through the small town of Seabreeze which seems like this is the most attention it’s received in a long time. The inhabitants watch everything. <EOS>
<BOS> You take your stuff and head to your room where you immediately reload your pistol and start organizing your belongings and items, just in case you need to leave in a hurry. <EOS>
<BOS> Teklis nods and puts away a couple of his magic objects. <EOS>
<BOS> "So wait, am I still wanted there?" You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You reply with a nasty, but playful look. <EOS>
<BOS> "Damn it, Vaughn..." You say and then another bullet flies near your head and into the floor. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point the captain and his people let you pass and you immediately tell Marco and the rest to go contact your other League members milling about at the Jicol docks to go back home. Meanwhile you’ll going to speak to some of the pirate contacts you have that might be currently in port. <EOS>
<BOS> The Guild member in question calls himself Sneaks. He’s an older man, though certainly still younger than Garrick. Says he’s been friends with Garrick for a long time and also mentions that he hopes you’re as promising as he’s heard. <EOS>
<BOS> “Actually might be time to get you a ring, but don’t worry about that right now. Just go back to your studies for now.” <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t really know what to say. You always knew Vera had some attraction to you, but you didn’t think it extended this far. Even with everything that’s going on with your body right now, this information has made you focus on something other than sex. <EOS>
<BOS> While this would probably be enough to give most the hint that one isn’t interested, Vera’s a little more persistent. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, so say maybe she does, what I find interesting is how you’ve been studying our relationship and interaction. Are you jealous?” you say with a chortle. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait a minute…you do you look a little familiar. What’s your father’s name?” <EOS>
<BOS> Weeks pass and while Madeline occasionally gives you a longing glance she never initiates anything. You try to keep your contact short with her. Camid doesn’t act out of the ordinary either when you see him. Neither one mentions their relationship with each other so you assume they’re still together. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thank you, sir! Thank you for allowing me to tell my side!” <EOS>
<BOS> “So…are you interested in just the ale or could I recommend one of the lovely sirens in the back?” the barkeep asks after you’ve had a few. <EOS>
<BOS> The one guy who snapped at you is still giving you a hard look, meanwhile the other one isn’t paying too much mind to you at all and is focused on his drink. Flynt of course is still smiling at you from across the table. <EOS>
<BOS> “As I recall, YOU nearly ran away like a scared guppy until I saved your fat ass.” Nimi remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Does Madeline have to return? I mean can’t she resist?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes.” <EOS>
<BOS> Like right now for instance. <EOS>
<BOS> “Damn Marco.” You say and go over to him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Really? Thought you told me the Spider Fangs shun human civilization centers.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Well maybe it’s not a curse, maybe it’s a magic disease like demon crotch rot or something.” <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora and Vaughn returned pretty quickly after this plan went into action, though in Zal’s case it seemed to be more because she wanted to get back into regular burglary again. Vaughn said he couldn’t deal with Jake anymore and was getting too crazy. <EOS>
<BOS> Now you're silent for a moment. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sorry we have to drink this horrid stuff. It’s all that’s available now. What I would give for a glass of brandy from the capital city…” the Captain says, mostly to himself than to Mira. “No matter. We will make due with what we have. Such is the way in conquest.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, you’re my brother and no matter what, I’ll always be by your side.” Your sister says touching your hand. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera looks away after your comment and goes silent. Her face is one of guilt and shame. <EOS>
<BOS> “Great. Now I have to worry about my reputation along with you as well.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What big picture?! You’re talking about enslaving my fucking girlfriend! You didn’t think I might get pissed about that?” <EOS>
<BOS> The dark energy liquefies your brain while having the added bonus of creating horrifying visions as you die. You scream and writhe in physical and mental agony for a few minutes before your body gives out completely. <EOS>
<BOS> From what you know, they’re little more than a gang of thugs, but they’re organized enough that they’ve lasted this long and even have ties to certain pirate groups based in Hessla. <EOS>
<BOS> So it was with no surprise that during your time before forming the League you went with a few other women from time to time. <EOS>
<BOS> “Please just calm down. We were getting along before.” Heather remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Now you can’t even speak. You just rub your hands over your face and pace rapidly. In a strange way, you not even that mad at Annah. Everyone pretty much hated you anyway and Annah’s actually just being herself. <EOS>
<BOS> The dark shape of Lorthander towers behind your kneeling body. The gnarled staff hits the ground near where Seth lays. Seth immediately throws one of his swords at the shaman, which harmlessly flies through Lorthander and bounces off the wall behind him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I suppose I can’t fault you for that. (Sigh)” <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh no my dear boy. Junior isn't his father. He's very much into technology that causes the most amount of casualties in the quickest time possible. Though I believe he probably did bludgeon a few that didn't die right away." <EOS>
<BOS> The trail of blood and broken branches led to the outskirts of the demon. Ekk’a knew he was getting close, but his buck would soon drop. The amount of blood loss clearly showed he would find it collapsed, breathing its final moments. If he had the Earth Mother’s blessing, it would find it soon. <EOS>
<BOS> “Why don’t you at least let me jerk you off? I mean it’s not sex right? You’re not penetrating me. I’m just going to be lending a helping hand as it were.” <EOS>
<BOS> Seth shakes his head in disagreement but doesn’t speak out. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, these fucking orcs don’t die like they should.” You say after putting two more shots in a large greenskin trying to get back up. <EOS>
<BOS> However, you were wrong. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well permission to speak fucking freely then.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Your fucking ring still won’t save you. Could have settled this a lot easier, but take solace that your bad choices will not affect your son. Now…ugh…” <EOS>
<BOS> You walk a little further and you see a few more of them on both sides of the road. Well if there’s anyone inside them, they’re going to be safely locked in a cage. <EOS>
<BOS> Marco and his crew leave as quick as they can and head back to Jicol. After chuckling a bit with your own people and taking your pistol back, you do start to do likewise. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? You seriously can’t be saying there’s something wrong with the way I look! Oh shit, you’re not like Vaughn are you?” <EOS>
<BOS> Now you’re just confused. <EOS>
<BOS> “I hope this is about our payment.” Zamed says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay…well that does sound less hopeless than I heard.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You can do that?” <EOS>
<BOS> Condescending of course, but if Vera noticed it, she’s not fussed or at least not letting it show. It’s sort of ironic anyway since Vera could very well HAVE had such problems if fate swung a different way. <EOS>
<BOS> You look down and see several sharpened branches puncturing your body, yet keeping it held up at the same time. Blood comes out of your mouth and despite the pain being fairly terrible, you cannot even utter anything louder than a dying groan. <EOS>
<BOS> While Vera is recovering and coughing, you pull your pistol. <EOS>
<BOS> After drinking your fill and resting a moment, you eventually make your way back to the League headquarters where business is going on as usual. You ask various members if they’ve seen Vera, eventually you bump into her and she answers herself. She doesn’t look any worse for wear. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well…I suppose I can see the logic in that. (Sigh) Very well, I suppose I can do it. I guess it was sort of my idea in the first place. Guess I better get that old bottle of absinium. Jake’s gonna want a peace offering…and probably something else. Just hope he doesn’t pass out like he always does. Ugh.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Make no mistake, this city IS going to suffer some shit, but I can’t imagine that it’s going to be any worse than the last time the Varsakken’s had it out with each other. Reports say he’ll probably be ready next year. So let me ask you, were you considering joining Peter’s invasion then?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m sure in certain circles you are, the EC more likely has more colorful names for you, but let’s not dwell on that. You’re here for fun. What would you like tonight?” <EOS>
<BOS> “So what? You ended up saving a whore who then blabbed to her fellow whores about the so-called noble thief that saved her life! You do realize that you’re probably not JUST on the ECS hit list, but you’ve probably just made enemies with certain members of what passes for the aristocracy around here along with a cult of fanatics.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t know how you aren’t worried about this! I mean she might be planning to bump us all off and become queen of the island!” <EOS>
<BOS> “You said we should guard this place.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Kill him? Oh no. There was a large magical disturbance last year at a known wizard’s home miles outside Holgard. An old acquaintance of the Elder actually. Flynn, myself and several other high ranking members went to investigate and let’s just say it didn’t go well and I was the only survivor. However it did mean there was now need of a new leader and since I still was the most experienced. I took charge. Well, took charge of the few that remained of our order at least.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Let’s go bail out the baroness I guess. Though it’s not exactly like I got magic to throw around like the rest of you, not sure how much help I’ll be.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because I don’t deny her skills as a thief and she’s very capable in that regard. The fact is, she wants more power, but for whatever reason she doesn’t want the actual position of being the boss. I assume it’s because then she’d actually have a target on her back. No, much safer to just stand in the shadows and criticize and play mini-puppeteer…sort of like what she’s doing with you.” <EOS>
<BOS> As you attempt to get up, Captain Rifiv is doing his best to hobble over in your direction. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit.” You remark to yourself being in awe of the power of the weapon. <EOS>
<BOS> In any event, you’ve raised enough coin and made the right shady connections to gain rare passage there. The use of carriages is a lot more exclusive during this time, let alone using them to travel to another city. However seeing as you’re heading to a town not many want to go to anyway, your obvious lack of nobility isn’t as much of an issue. Indeed you’ll probably be assumed to be another bastard. <EOS>
<BOS> You also visit one of the better brothels in the city and as it turns out when you enter you’re met with a lot of positivity by the madam and some of the other ladies. At first you figure they’re just being nice to get more money out of you, but as it turns out the girl you set free back in Reginald’s house was a worker here. (She’s thoughtfully been given a couple days off so she can get her head back in the game again) <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I know what the smug asshole ECS rep told me and you’ve pretty much confirmed it with your actions. In fact I sort of figured you’d outright deny everything or put up more of a fight. Didn’t think it would be this easy. Guessing you must feel guilty about all this on some level. Again before we continue, I’m going to have to ask you disarm.” <EOS>
<BOS> The ship will dock in Stone City, soon, and from there it should be easy to arrange transportation to the Grove. But Fulgrill's warnings play in your mind - could your precious Ivani be part of the reason the stories, your second-greatest love in life, vanish as soon as they are told? <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not me…par…ents…for…old times…please…” <EOS>
<BOS> “You want to continue, be my guest, but I’m gonna get some sleep. I’m tired. Sides, looks like we got lucky. Guess the bandit crew that was wandering around this area moved on. Praise Yag.” <EOS>
<BOS> Dearest Ivani, <EOS>
<BOS> All you can make out is a bunch of dark figures struggling with each other. <EOS>
<BOS> "Let's just say, most of my so called people are the ones I want to have killed." <EOS>
<BOS> Shade’s stare softens a bit and he even smirks a bit before taking the orb. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm not sure I can," you say. "Unfortunately, Disbrook is just a small outpost for the ferry - not much chance to earn coin there, and I must get to the Grove of the Muses." <EOS>
<BOS> A knock at the door appears, distracting you momentarily from the army’s celebration. Standing outside is Seth holding two tankards. He offers you one, which you take with gratitude. <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, it’s going to be a pain in the ass, but it can be done. It’s also possible that this is going to just be temporary and even if it isn’t, it probably won’t hurt our business too much and we’ll survive.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait. He’s fucking dead? You stopped ME from killing him. What the hell happened?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t speak to me about duty! We’re out here because of our duty and loyalty to Aeric. I’m willing to protect my king by any means necessary -- even if that means disobeying a direct order from him in the process.” <EOS>
<BOS> "So would he be interested?" <EOS>
<BOS> "Hm, if you say so." Zal says giving you a look like she doesn't quite believe you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm. Rook’s not going to be happy about that. Oh well, maybe he’ll pop up somewhere. Roaches always do. Guess all that’s left is the looting which I think the boys are doing a good job of right now. The Syndicate has been thinking of expanding into slave trade here and this place will probably make a good location with some additions. Anyway, we should get back to Rook.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What’s going on?!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, the Bloody Talons are indeed no more. Oh sure there’s a couple of them still lingering about trying to keep what’s left of the rabble, but I anticipate that even that will be gone by the end of the year thanks to the militia.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Same one I always send Marco, continue to do what the fuck I want. If the infamous governor has a problem with my activities then he can either declare war or he can come up with some sort of reasonable deal as opposed to limp wristed threats.” <EOS>
<BOS> Year 31 <EOS>
<BOS> "How rude!" The Empress stamps her foot. "This is my kingdom, not your Mage Academy. But Official Hancho makes a fair point, there is yet a half-hour left for Audience. Storyteller -" she turns back to you, "You have a half hour to prepare a tale. Something with horses, of course." <EOS>
<BOS> “I know you did that on purpose,” he spits. <EOS>
<BOS> Axel, the eldest, put the horses in his care through strict exercise routines three times a day. <EOS>
<BOS> "Because you don't walk away from this life." <EOS>
<BOS> Your last words are too much and Tanya takes a step towards you and backhands you across the face. She probably wasn’t even using half of her strength either and you go sprawling to the ground in a daze. <EOS>
<BOS> “Teckleville? Never heard of it! What the hell are you doing out here then?” <EOS>
<BOS> This is just so surreal to you right now. Never in your life did you ever think you’d get an offer like this. Then again never in your life did you ever think you would ever do this much fighting either, but you guess on that day when you took your first life and had to run your ass out of Teckleville, it’s been a path of increasing bloodshed ever since. Why should Ludmilla’s offer be any stranger? <EOS>
<BOS> “Hrm, well release the rest then, and remind them that these slaves are not their personal fuck toys unless they’re actually going to be paying for them out of pocket. As for these elves, well have them cleaned as much as you can and hopefully some of the buyers aren’t picky about bruises.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, well there is that. Not that you’re unattractive mind you, but…well it was a bit awkward. Under different circumstances it might have been fun, but I suppose you’re forever bound to another.” Heather says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Even if that is the case, taking down a caster is no easy task, especially in his home. Who knows what magical traps and surprises lie in wait,” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> Inrit Gardens almost sparkles this time of morning. The Paradise and Frangia flowers are still wet with dew, and the water of several fountains refracts the morning light into miniature rainbows. <EOS>
<BOS> Then again with the curse you have, that isn’t likely to ever be a problem. <EOS>
<BOS> “Checking something. Hmm, interesting. Very interesting. Perhaps Elder Flynn will be interested in helping you after all.” Heather says and suddenly an opening in the barrier appears. “Well? Come on in, I’m not supposed to leave this open for very long!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Not that I can recall.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, have to hand it to you Sneaks, you didn’t just sit on your hands. You literally dug in deep to make it difficult to root the last of you fuckers out.” You think to yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re not that well versed in the value of medical supplies and drugs, but you figure the Crimson Talons could be willing to fence whatever you bring. Hell, you probably could just sell the stuff yourself. You know more than enough folks in your area that bitch about not being able to afford shit from the local apothecary, let alone proper medicine. <EOS>
<BOS> “Pfft. This is MY fucking ship. I’ll speak how I please. You all had best remember that.” Zamed replies. <EOS>
<BOS> “Now I ask again, what the hell are you doing here? <EOS>
<BOS> "The two of you may stay here, then," the sailor says in relief, and leads the triumphant blood priestess to a bunk of her own. <EOS>
<BOS> Garrick starts laughing. <EOS>
<BOS> "There is a way?" <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora and Vaughn look at each other and then you. <EOS>
<BOS> You got fucked in more ways than one and the worst part, you don’t have anyone to blame but yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s a port town west of Hessla and from what I’ve heard it’s wide open like a whore’s legs. Nobody has tried to organize anything there and the city focuses so much on defending against potential pirate attacks that it doesn’t have the heightened security like say Klyton does in recent years. I say we start there.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, that will do it. You’ll have to sleep in the cargo hold though and if I find out you’ve messed about with any of the goods down there, well if you aren’t familiar with the term keelhauling, you’ll become very familiar. We leave tomorrow morning. Don’t be late.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I do not know. I only feel - I feel the stories and dreams rejuvenate me, little by little. Even your own tales, at times. Sometimes, a memory not my own will pass over me and refresh me like water. If we are to blame for this, then perhaps it would be better to destroy us. This limbo we are trapped in is not living, anyway, but a slow and lingering shade of existence." <EOS>
<BOS> Before you can give a more thorough answer a small ugly green child wanders in behind Warts. You don’t know how old it is, but it can’t be older than a toddler. <EOS>
<BOS> “Before you start shooting, it’s just me. I see I came just in time to see you giving the children a break.” Vera says slowly entering the room. <EOS>
<BOS> From what you can tell, you’re still somewhat correct about her being a little self-destructive. While her self esteem isn’t so low that she’s outright suicidal, there’s definitely enough dissatisfaction in her existence that it’s caused her to not enjoy her life of privilege and instead hang around a violent criminal organization. Probably daddy issues as well given that he’s brought up a couple times and she quickly doesn’t want to talk about him. (Mother is apparently dead) You even try to ask who he is, but she just assures you that he’s not on the Klyton Council if that’s what you were wondering about. <EOS>
<BOS> “But getting back to my point Tom doesn’t really want to be bothered to change things too much because as I said, he lacks the ambition to be a true leader. Still, he seems to like you since you rescued him from that cage and you generally don’t give him grief, so maybe there’s a chance. Come on, I let you into this temple I call a body, you can at least let me into that head of yours a bit.” <EOS>
<BOS> While normally walking about in the open during the day with a bag of heads where the blood is leaking through might cause some issues, but given the state of the city, it just serves as a warning for people not to mess with you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, it doesn’t hurt to have a non-aligned magic user give their opinion, but if I feel like things are shady there, like her demanding his blood or something, then I’ll be walking out of there as well.” <EOS>
<BOS> Vera touches your face. <EOS>
<BOS> “Peter Varsakken?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm your new business partner. Or in your words, I'm your new fucking business partner." <EOS>
<BOS> “So I’m an inconvenience to you? I’m starting to wonder if you really love me at all.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, never had dat problem. Anywayz I was askin’ where ya gonna hold dis meetin’ of Holgard’s most wanted, an when?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Nature’s Revenge! The lead singer. She was a fucking beauty. I mean I know elves tend to be pretty, but fuck. I wasted no time in putting the moves on her after their set and she was already giving me head. Fucking hell it was great!” Hank remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well there are spells that can do all sorts of things, but again, did you have an idea of what you wanted exactly?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Here you are. Hey, I see one on your shoulder. Did you change your mind?” Gossey asks. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re pondering your possible future you bump into Virgil as you’re stepping in the Welcome Mat. <EOS>
<BOS> A couple days pass and you’ve finally gotten your answer from the Black Hooks and apparently despite some tough talk by Marco, he’s agreed to meet with you, just outside the city. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, sort of twisted where people’s minds go. (Sigh) I guess this is goodbye. Are you leaving tonight, are you telling mom and dad?” <EOS>
<BOS> “So…is this silent act supposed to shed more light on whether or not I’m in the Guild or not or are you just fascinated by my good looks?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why should I trust you? You’re in a cage meant for criminals.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you get back, you’re about to go straight to Tom who is in his office, but before you can Zalmora stops you. <EOS>
<BOS> For all the issues with this, you’re convinced that this is going to be better in the long run. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm not saying it's not going to take effort, but again this is a long term plan. I mean going up top, trying to set up false businesses and store fronts is just not going to work in Klyton. The place is just too damn repressive, but we all know people still WANT to do illegal shit like whoring, drugs, gambling..." <EOS>
<BOS> “I have. I don’t think he likes me though. In fact I think he’s got a deep-seated dislike of women in general. I’m sure it has something to do with his mother being a lesbian or something.” <EOS>
<BOS> Still, on the plus side, Peter’s failed miserably on getting much further mainly because he doesn’t have enough men to hold this place. Most of his mercenaries have been killed and while he does have two wizards to help him, they are literally the only thing that’s keeping him in the fight. <EOS>
<BOS> “But you’ve never been to the other places either!” <EOS>
<BOS> In the meantime, you can imagine the comments you’re going to get from Zal about this, but then what else is new? <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh fuck, we need to stop this right now!” you shout. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, you might be surprised how dull things are for me right now. A lot of the more interesting stuff happened in the past. I warn you though, it’s a long story.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…got anything to drink?” Madeline responds while walking and looking around. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well since you agreed to it already, say in three days? You’ll meet Elana at the carriage station in the morning. You’ll recognize her by her tan skin, long curly brown hair, a large pack for the trip no doubt and she’ll probably be a bit too well dressed for the occasion.” <EOS>
<BOS> The concerns that Vera and Warts both bring up aren’t lost on you, in fact you’ve been having them yourself. You’ve already been seeing a drop in profit in most of your business ventures. <EOS>
<BOS> You try to walk down the more isolated street with nobody about, but you need to get off them entirely before you potentially start molesting someone or worse. You’d go to a brothel, but if you did, you’d just end up killing all your employees. <EOS>
<BOS> After they leave, several of your people escort them out of the room and anyone else left, seems to relax slightly. <EOS>
<BOS> Your eyes briefly widen and go back to normal when she admits to that. You didn’t actually know about the slave trading, though you suppose you aren’t too surprised. It’s what she did before she joined with you and you imagine that it’s pretty lucrative what with all the pirate types she has to do business with. She probably was doing it the whole time she was sent to Jicol. <EOS>
<BOS> “And what of the nation’s people? They are at the mercy of the Empire.” <EOS>
<BOS> You can only see out one eye and its dark, but you know immediately that these are the same Bloody Talons you ran into the night you broke up with Annah. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well at least we know we’re getting pretty close to the city. Besides, if there is anyone inside, they’re going to be locked up in the cages. Just stay away from grabbing reach.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Now that’s a grand idea there Zamed. Marco…” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “How did you even get past the front gate with the…oh nevermind, I don’t care it’s you!” you say and immediately give her big hug which she returns. <EOS>
<BOS> You crash to the bench, sobbing. She has given you her power, a fledgling power that will grow - enough to tell stories that cannot fade, to teleport, to fight against any mage or man who would attack you, and to call slumbering creatures of dream and memory to awaken. She has sacrificed herself, again, for the sake of the world. <EOS>
<BOS> Black mist begins to swirl at the circle’s center. It begins low and then slowly builds in density and rotation. As quickly as it appeared, the mist dissipates. A lone figure hunches in the summoning circle: Ragar the Unbroken. His skin loosely hangs from his bones, completely absent in many places. The few strands of black hair that haven’t fallen out completely dangle near the edge of his shoulders. The left side of his mouth is completely rotted away. <EOS>
<BOS> Control is back. <EOS>
<BOS> The water isn’t excessively deep, but the current in the river is strong that it instantly starts carrying your away. You no idea where the hell it’s taking you, but your main concern is trying not to drown. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hold on! Hold on! Stop! Stop!” you exclaim and take the knife away from Annah before she commits murder. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmph! Shoulda thought about that before you left wherever it is you came from!” the guard says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit, well how much does he charge to solve the problem?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmm, indeed he was seeking out potential allies on the inside. I was not however aware that it was more criminals. We have enough of that lot with these pirates masquerading as privateers. Still, Baron Peter Varsakken is a pragmatic man and will listen to what you have to say. Your greenskins will have to stay here and you will turn your weapons over to me obviously.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure boss, no problem.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So are you taking over the Talons as boss?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well no, but I’ve heard tales…” <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you see some old guy in a robe and figure he must be someone of importance. You call out and he slowly turns to you and making motions with his hands. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh shit! Gwen you fucking idiot!” Heather shouts and quickly begins to call for help, along with casting a beam of frost at Tanya. <EOS>
<BOS> Once again, much like how it was Klint, you show no remorse and pull the trigger of the pistol. <EOS>
<BOS> “Looks that way.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, yeah that’s the other bit and the main reason why I came to warn you directly. There aren’t many of them left and so they’re desperate. One of the things the cultist laughed about before he died was the fact that all this chaos has allowed them to summon a greater infernal or something. He didn’t say what it was exactly, just that it was coming to wreak havoc on the Syndicate. And I hate to step out of line here, because I know I’ve already probably pissed you off, but the more time we waste with trying to determine if I’m a liar or not, is less time we have preparing for this attack.” <EOS>
<BOS> You return to your usual routine. <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, it’s getting dark again and as much as you’re getting used to sleeping outside, you’d prefer to sleep on a normal bed for a change. You just hope that you’ve got enough for a room. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora sits down next to you and exhales. <EOS>
<BOS> “Klint, seriously what the hell is your problem? I don’t understand this continued antagonism towards me. I don’t go over to your family’s chicken farm and steal the cocks out of your hand.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Great. So I guess you can't help me." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Either way your days of being a rogue are over. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t know, I just know that they are common enough there to be a problem. Whether that means you buy them or catch them, makes no difference. As I said, that’s going to be Elana’s primary concern, but obviously if you can help in that matter too, it would be greatly appreciated." <EOS>
<BOS> "You are right," she softly smiles. "I've forgotten myself in my long sleep. I will go with you, across the whole world if we have to. We will find a way to restore the stories and the dreams." <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah, guess not. Okay, I’ll speak to Zamed that went he leaves, you’ll be coming with him and he can come pick me up when you return.” <EOS>
<BOS> Within the next two months, you’ve ironically eliminated most of the random crime in the city thanks to your secret police system. It’s probably the most orderly the city has ever been. Ludmilla certainly approves and gives you praise for being so efficient in your new position. You also finally get a response back from Vera though it’s brief. <EOS>
<BOS> After a bit of silence, you speak up again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh? Well did he tell you what this big guy wanted too?” Randi asks. <EOS>
<BOS> "So what're you saying? You want to go back and hide in the shit filled sewers like we were doing? I thought you'd be happy to get out of there completely since you were the main one bitching about it. Look, as long as we keep a low profile we're fine. We've been doing well so far right?" <EOS>
<BOS> "I can carve," you offer, "and tell stories." <EOS>
<BOS> In the next few days, Vaughn lets you know that everything has been set in motion and the Klyton militia is going to launch a full scale assault on the location. They apparently want this to go so successfully they're doing their best keeping it secret. (Though Vaughn's boyfriend Gregory has a big mouth and told him everything anyway.) <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, but it could be worse! I mean you’re with me!” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m pretty sure it counts, some of those other women blew me too.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Be that as it may, I thought the Guild was supposed to just be a loose alliance anyway and Garrick wasn’t officially our boss. And if he isn’t our boss, then that means I can do what the hell I want.” <EOS>
<BOS> “New ally…wait…what, your people?” <EOS>
<BOS> Klint instead screams with rage until his face is beet red. It’s sort of unnerving, but you stand your ground. Swinging his knife wildly, he charges at you still screaming the entire time. <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t get over it when I first saw you. You really think I’m going to now? You said we bonded.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It isn’t in Klyton, but we could always start doing it outside of Klyton. Robbing caravans and such on the roads. It isn’t like Jake is going to care where he does it and those two half elf whores will probably be ecstatic about working outside the city. Also, the militia isn’t going to be as fanatical about tracking down shit that goes on outside the city.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, from what youz told me, sounds more like you destroyed them both. No wonder nobody else wants to work with you. Youz a jinx.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hrm. Why is that shop run by that old hag off limits?” <EOS>
<BOS> You need to get back home as soon as possible; you really don’t want to be out in the jungle after dark, especially in some ruined temple. Who knows what the hell is living in that thing. <EOS>
<BOS> “And if Ludmilla dies, then what?” Heather remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, never realized I actually was all that important really.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You let him live? You sure he’s not going to try to get revenge someday?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh? And that’s what all of you have decided?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m guessing they had it coming.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So we have no choice.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Can’t I just bribe them to look the other way?” <EOS>
<BOS> "I'll introduce you to Kinsam, the Priest in charge of guests," Pelomin assures you. <EOS>
<BOS> “And they pair you against an opponent in the ring. The winner moves on, the loser doesn’t.” <EOS>
<BOS> She comes back out fairly quickly and after making another hole in the barrier she hands you a solid black glass sphere through it. <EOS>
<BOS> You reach the edge of the forest and the forked path and look down over the village. Inrit Gardens dazzles even from here, a patch of green and blue, home to many stately homes and several larger mansions. Everything there seems quiet, almost untouchable. The main Village is a bit more brown and homely, but you can see the colorful awnings of the market stalls in Town Square, as well as at least a hundred small figures moving about. It should be a good crowd, today. You step forward, clenching your staff with veined, papery hands. Where will you begin your journey? <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, I'm a big disappointment to them, but as you said, let's cut the bullshit and come to some sort of arrangement. How much you want for the tavern?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey Keira, you catch that hunting this time?” some other woman asks and points at you. <EOS>
<BOS> “You don’t? I thought you had a girl you routinely partnered with all the time. Wasn’t she your girlfriend or…oh wait…bad break up?” <EOS>
<BOS> You soon enter a small partially dug out room that has a single lantern lighting it. You don’t see anything out of the ordinary here. <EOS>
<BOS> One day, after a long morning of gathering wild grape vines in the woods for your mother, you come down familiar paths toward your village only to smell smoke in the air – and lots of it. You begin to worry about the cause and drop the bundle of vines to hurry forward. <EOS>
<BOS> “Bullshit.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What sort of arrangement?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> When you get your head up off the floor, the paralysis is wearing off, but now you see Tanya in front of you looking at you like a predator with its prey. She definitely doesn’t seem like herself. <EOS>
<BOS> “I see. Why?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Mom, wouldn’t allow that.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well news of what happened on this island hasn’t quite reached Teckleville yet, but even if it did, I’m sure Mom would probably still want to see you. Not sure about Dad, but I doubt he’d throw you out on your ear right away, especially if you brought a grandchild with you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey! That’s not even true! I just gave you my fucking thoughts on the situation didn’t I? You bring up whatever you want to Tom. I’m sure everything will work out fine, he likes you after all.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What?! I’ll have you know that I’ve NEVER skimmed off the top! While it is true much coin has been made under my management of the League, you’ve always gotten your cut! However…if you decide to come to Jicol, you may as well know, I do have a side business for my own independent of the League.” <EOS>
<BOS> That is never going to happen. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um what?” a little taken by surprise. <EOS>
<BOS> “Bolt, tell our Shadow Blade friends outside that each one of them needs to go to our most profitable locations. Probably not enough of them to cover them all, but we got what we got.” Rook says. <EOS>
<BOS> I have also empowered the Traveling Map to take you to the Stronghold too, even though you’ve not been there yet. A little tweak of the rules, if you will, for your convenience. All I ask in return is that you recover the Oblitterum Nomeno and bring it back to me, so that I can seal it back up, away from the world. And you’ll need to recover it too; for it absorbs necromantic energies, and is the only thing that will protect you from Mad Merodatch’s terrible spells. With it, you’ll be able to face him ‘man-to-man’ as it were, and stand or fall by the merits of your own arm. <EOS>
<BOS> “Like what? More ideas about how to improve things around here? I know how you’re not satisfied with how things are around here, but then I suppose you aren’t the only one.” <EOS>
<BOS> “But this kid doesn’t look like he’s Claw. He doesn’t even have the tattoo on his arm.” <EOS>
<BOS> First thing you do is head over to Gilo’s place. Gilo is pretty much a small one-man operation as far as the cooking goes though he’s got his son and daughter running around taking orders from customers. You were going to ask Gilo if he has any live qweepas, but the man seems to be too busy to do anything except cook and order his children around. You can sort of see into the kitchen, but there is no way you can enter it without someone seeing you. <EOS>
<BOS> Samuel enters the kitchen to discover it’s not empty. A young girl with bright blonde hair is on the floor with a bucket and rag. She scrubs at the floor, purposefully, ensuring every inch of the floor is spotless. <EOS>
<BOS> “Could work too. I mean if we did attack, we probably should go all the way with it so employing both tactics would be best. Also if we were going this route, with hiring pirates to provide back up, I think I can convince one I know Zamed, to lead.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay boss, I’ll get right on it. Um, what if any of them are currently helping the Countess?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Will stop fucking being a massive bitch right now? I know everything’s fucked up! I just need a minute to think for a moment!” you say, trying not to shout and possibly alert attention. <EOS>
<BOS> “And don’t think about trying to run, I can split a grizzly’s skull with this axe from a large distance. Wouldn’t take much to do the same to the likes of you.” Ardan says as you pass him. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, it’s all pretty pointless without someone to share it with. You couldn’t go back home and say “Look mom and dad, look at what I’ve done!” It sucks. Your sister would probably be impressed, but who knows where she is. You hope she’s having more fun than you are right now. You miss her sometimes. Simpler times. Happier times. <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, occasionally. But that’s not really what I meant. I was more talking about how almost everyone except you that’s played a major role in the events of my life are dead. I mean I’m just thinking about some of them Naji, Yinen, Garrick, Rook, Shadow, Gloom, Heather…” <EOS>
<BOS> Of course this is going to be a lot of work and you are still new. While Tom might like you, the other members may see you as an upstart. Getting a knife in the back from a bunch of folks who are supposed to be watching it is a real possibility. You might be better off going off on your own. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course you could just go in now and shoot everyone. Probably a lot more dangerous and you’d be depriving yourself of possible followers, but if you’re successful, you’d certainly establish yourself as the big swinging dick of the underworld, along with taking over the territory you wanted in the first place. <EOS>
<BOS> In the mean time, you might as well find a new place to stay while you figure things out. You head to Hell’s Own Inn since it’s at least some place that you know and can consider hospitable. <EOS>
<BOS> “But my feelings for her are not just physical. I mean yeah that’s part of it, but I’ve been getting to know her and I feel a real connection with her.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well wake him the fuck up! I got a case of dick fire over here and I need the fucking cure!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Everyone in this town hates you, y’know. Even that whore you hang around with now. She came on to me the other night saying how she wanted a proper fuck as opposed to your pathetic attempts. I didn’t fuck her though; I just let her suck my dick. Did she kiss you today? Ha ha ha ha!” <EOS>
<BOS> Sort of an interesting goal you weren’t expecting from Heather. Not really one that directly interferes with your own business either, perhaps it could even be a new opportunity, if it ever gets off the ground. <EOS>
<BOS> “So, been watching me since I got here huh? Good to know.” <EOS>
<BOS> By the time you reach Hessla, night is starting to fall. Elana orders the carriage to stop and then asks the driver where is the best place to stay in the town. The driver suggests the Cozy Krak Inn. He mentions that it is fairly expensive though that usually means it’s never completely filled, but Elana tells him she isn’t worried about the price. <EOS>
<BOS> You and everyone else takes a step back. You’re actually a little creeped out now and a lot more concerned. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck that. This sends a message to everyone not to fuck with us!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure, might as well. Okay let’s go.” <EOS>
<BOS> You manage to just get out of your backyard when you hear someone else shout that they see you and you’re soon off and running from a mob again. <EOS>
<BOS> "No, I'm not fucking done. This inn is a fucking Crimson Talon business! Now if you want to step down and live like some regular jerk off fine. But YOU don't get to take this with you! This is OUR place." Camid remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> With the bag over your shoulder, you head to the large back room of the inn, where you’re met by several criminal types. A lot of them have already been drinking heavily. Some nod at you with respect, while others not so much. <EOS>
<BOS> “The fuck’s with the hostility?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I thought as much. I trust you’ve told her some of what this is all about right?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> While this isn't the best situation, you're not giving in to despair. As soon as you figure out how to survive here, maybe you can somehow figure out a way to get back. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, this particular temple has been engaged in the concept of flexibility for quite some time now. And I appreciate your dedication to our partnership, which is why I’m puzzled that you did not ask for our help on your own matter.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well obviously Mr. Reynolds isn’t going to just let him go wandering off so we’d probably have to pay him and that’s what isn’t going to be cheap. Plus, knowing Mr. Reynolds he’ll have some other weird stipulation. You’ll probably find out when you talk with him. Could be anything.” <EOS>
<BOS> As you and Vaughn push the desk up against the door, you already hear the crashing behind it. From the other side, you hear your name being called out telling you to surrender or face consequences. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, nothing like that, it’s just…it’s complicated and I don’t have time to explain. You see, my girlfriend’s a…” <EOS>
<BOS> The statues try to grab you at first, but then soon realize the best way to get you is going up the stairs. <EOS>
<BOS> You begin your tale... <EOS>
<BOS> Or at least they would have if it were actually him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey! Hey you!” a voice calls out. <EOS>
<BOS> Heather sits down and moves some papers and books around on her desk while addressing you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, sounds like Flynt. It’s an unconventional method of recruitment, but sometimes he likes to randomly test youngsters that he feels could be useful. Dunno why he does things that way, but when you’ve got drugs and coins to blow, I guess you can afford to take risks like that. I dunno, I’m just in it for the violence myself.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Dear people of Inrit Gardens," you address them, "I am Dustan the Fabler, the Storyteller of Dreaming Forest. I have come here to regale you with a tale of the fantastic, a story of a princess and a hanging garden. But I must ask you to be my muses for the day! I need an item, precious or plain, something fantastic or mundane. Who will volunteer the object of this tale?" <EOS>
<BOS> Fortunately, Captain Rifiv was so paranoid about them from last encounter that he made everyone carry some with them at all time. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey kid! Good news! You’re in! We were debating about letting you in early and a lot of people were against it since they felt you needed to spend more paying dues as it were, but then Tanya came back and spoke about what you did last night against the Ebony Claw and her opinions pushed Garrick, who was just bending to popular opinion anyway, to make a final decision to let you in! Ain’t that great?” Sneaks says. <EOS>
<BOS> You see a sprawling city though it’s much larger than any sort of city you’ve ever been to (granted you’ve only been to Holgard, but you can tell it’s much bigger than that). Also unlike Holgard everything is very orderly and the buildings are in much better condition in general. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck. I’m gonna have…shit, I need to talk to her, I mean him, I mean…damnit!” <EOS>
<BOS> You need to get to Arcanius. If you run and these assholes lose, then you’re in for a long walk. If you run away and they live, you can’t imagine that the survivors aren’t going to be keen on taking you along after you abandoned them, also resulting in a long walk. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well when I get rid of you that will be one less problem!” <EOS>
<BOS> Flynn does absolutely nothing and just continues chanting, meanwhile Heather continues to look unwell and go on with her task. She starts to cough up blood on you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Never thought about it that way, but I suppose you might be right. I also suppose I should be wondering if the Delantium Kingdom will be declaring war on me to put an outpost here.” You say with a mild chuckle. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tell me, why do you hesitate? Do you have close friends in the Guild? I can only imagine that the answer is yes, because if the answer was no, you would be spilling your guts right now. In fact, you probably would have done so on our first meeting. It’s obvious you have no real love for the organization itself because if you did, you wouldn’t even be considering any of this in the first place. You would be a good little Guild soldier and tell me how you’d never betray Garrick or the Guild. At which point I’d stop wasting my time and kill you. So you must have emotional attachment to someone there. Tell me who it is, and perhaps an arrangement can be made.” Rook says. <EOS>
<BOS> The noise of your pistol now causes the opposing wizard to take notice of you. He doesn’t waste any time in throwing a bolt of energy at you. You try to get out of the way, but you still get hit with a blast strong enough to cause you to go flying backwards. <EOS>
<BOS> Soon, he says that he has more important business to attend to and dismisses you at which point several soldiers escort you out and most of the way to the Traveller. <EOS>
<BOS> She also goes back to how she recently visited your parents and besides being glad to see her, they also told her what happened with you a few months after she left. What's fascinating to you though is apparently you were cleared of murder months after you left! <EOS>
<BOS> “…um…oh. Uh…” is about all you can spit out since you’re taken off guard by the statement. Also you’re not exactly sure what this means exactly. Heather seems pretty excited though. <EOS>
<BOS> "You are the head mage now, Kegurin." <EOS>
<BOS> She conjures up a fireball and directs it towards the other wizard in the street below. He’s not even looking in that direction so he takes the hit. You then see a figure screaming and burning which is then followed by one of the demons leaping on him and ripping him apart. <EOS>
<BOS> You only have a dagger with you that you were using to gather grape vines, a sling-pack to carry them in, and a stone sling for protection. If you can get closer, you may be able to pick your mother or father out from the various mobs, but you’re not sure what you will do if you find them. <EOS>
<BOS> “Any of you lot seen Ophelia around?” <EOS>
<BOS> “We don’t have time for that, important work must be done. That half-breed you walked in with has only begun to realize the untapped potential of her powers. Honestly, I don’t know how she has managed to suppress her infernal side for so long. Most daughters of true succubi by her age have long since gone on to embrace their infernal heritage. This one was obviously lost, but no more.” Reginald says. <EOS>
<BOS> “And if you want to know the exact amount I’m ready to pay you, twenty thousand in gold coin. And that’s just for you personally. Every captain you get under your command for this will get ten. However we both know there is going to be casualties, so YOU will get half of any dead captains’ share. Now I’m sure you can do the math and realize that will be a shitload of riches correct?” <EOS>
<BOS> You survive, though a bit banged up. The couple are still alive too, though the man looks to be very dazed with a big gash on his head and his woman is crying over him. <EOS>
<BOS> "Helping around the ship obviously and the usual pillaging of coastal villages or ships. You do have some fighting skills and would have no problem with something like that I assume." <EOS>
<BOS> “Me?” <EOS>
<BOS> Gertrude laughs. <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile Ardan is still complaining. <EOS>
<BOS> The only other place that comes to mind is Hessla which for one thing is a whole lot closer, but it also still has a reputation of being a haven for thieves, pirates, and other criminal types. <EOS>
<BOS> Something has to be done and the best way to do it is to kill Jake. Not like you were ever friends with him. <EOS>
<BOS> Madeline for the first time stops acting so casual about this situation and starts taking it seriously. <EOS>
<BOS> “HEY! HEY! STOP SHOOTING! CAN’T WE COME TO A DEAL?!” a female voice shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, you guess she’s fine for now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course it does. Look, we’re getting the hell out of here. This place has been a big fat zero.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You go to your “place of work” where the usual group of lowly Ebony Claw thugs stand around keeping the Blue Dream addicts in line. Meanwhile you head to the two assholes who run the place. Dreamweaver and Mr. Dream. The unimaginative idiots must have thought they were being real clever with those names. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well for a criminal organization we aren’t exactly diverse. Granted I don’t know much about running something like this, but I have heard the old Crimson Talon glory day stories. The Talons used to have fighting pits, used to sell Green Lotus and Yellow Devil, we had whores, I mean a whole bunch of shit that brought in a steady revenue of coinage.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why don’t you want me to have nice things?” <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately the woods eventually begins to thin and if you continue walking the way you are going, you’re going to be in the open plains and if you’re going to march across the open fields, you might as well just walk on the road since you’ll be just as exposed. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, I already know what you think. That I'm getting old and fearful and I've lost my will for this lifestyle. Well maybe all of that is true to some extent, but I don't see why that's such a bad thing. I mean I had the thrill of being a criminal and all that, well I'm done with that part of my life now. I don't find any joy in it anymore. I grew out of it. Happens to the best of us and I don't see why you don't see the logic in going legit either. You don't seem particularly all that happy and you're constantly going into these frenzies. Can you honestly say this life is as much fun as it was say ten years ago? I mean you'd at least have less worry if you weren't living this life." <EOS>
<BOS> You start to walk away. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey what’s…SHIT!” Annah yelps as Klint’s body tackles into her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmm, not as stupid as you appear. I can respect that too. But if your answer is no then you will be leaving after all and I don’t think I need to explain why. Madeline’s mother isn’t as nice as I am.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Somebody what?” <EOS>
<BOS> “You are Zamed, correct?” one of the higher ranking looking ones asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure, whatever.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey son, don’t you still want that room?” Flynt asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You nearly bump into another couple also making out. By the time you grab your drink, you realize there are a lot of people kissing and hugging each other. And some of them are getting pretty hot and heavy. <EOS>
<BOS> “You mean spend the night together? Why how improper! We aren’t even married!” Annah laughs. <EOS>
<BOS> “K…ooogh…hurts…” <EOS>
<BOS> As you ask this, you touch Tanya’s arm, which she retracts. <EOS>
<BOS> You can barely hear the two greenskins now as your body continues to bleed out and your organs shut down. <EOS>
<BOS> "Destroy those terrible monsters," the commander interrupted from behind them, showing up with a group of fifty soldiers. "I knew following you, Niro, would be the best strategy. It's like you are...connected...to them." <EOS>
<BOS> “Ahamed?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…but no…but I got some (hic) news…” <EOS>
<BOS> The small but persistant slug received a great treasure for his long journey - a shell on his back - and the gods took the rest of the treasure back to the sky, laughing at the absurdity of the great animals and wondering if they should make another creature, to rule them all, who had the wisdom and ingenuity of the simple slug. <EOS>
<BOS> “Seth and his men have chosen their path. It is not my place to decide their fate,” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “So why stick around?” <EOS>
<BOS> As soon as you enter though he starts scolding you for losing your temper in front of Mr. Reynolds and disrespecting him as head of the organization. You defend why you’re getting mad about the situation and don’t understand why he isn’t since it’s fucked up the plans that were supposed to be set in motion. When you find out he paid the five hundred coins anyway you get even angrier. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes?" Zalmora responds turning around. <EOS>
<BOS> Soon your guest arrives. Time has passed, but the face is one you could never forget. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the fuck! You startled me! And after…nevermind let’s talk inside and do it quickly.” You remark and start guiding Annah inside. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, your cordial relationship with the temple has had benefits you hadn’t intended. Due to the Felians being on better terms with the Baroness, some of that “understanding” has inadvertently trickled down towards you. As a result the Nocturnal League has freer reign over the city than it once did. Possibly similar to what the ECS once had. <EOS>
<BOS> After a quick check to see if anyone is in the area, you get out of your bloody clothes and change into some new ones. You might not be properly clean, but it’s better than you were. <EOS>
<BOS> Captain Elias stands there in shock as two of your men disarm him. He really is a big coward. <EOS>
<BOS> As for what you’re going to do, you guess you need to build up your coin all over again. She didn’t take your tools or weapons, so that’s a plus. The whole reason why you were leaving Klyton was to start this new life with Annah. Now that that’s off the table, you might as well stay a little longer. Who knows though, maybe you will leave one day. <EOS>
<BOS> Instead of taking them to their normal pasture, he brought them to Malong field. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, but let's sit down and talk, I'm sure you're winded after that." <EOS>
<BOS> You might be a fool, but unfortunately Tanya’s words are proving correct. Your memories are all suddenly flooding back. You see the murders as clear as yesterday now. You see what you did and how you even enjoyed doing it at times. It was you. It was you the entire time and you blacked it all out. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmm, considering that you have more of a habit of spying and stalking me, I’d say that could be said more about you.” <EOS>
<BOS> You see the exit in the distance and then you see a wispy green glow materialize in front of it. A malevolent face briefly appears and then one of the statues closest to you comes to life! <EOS>
<BOS> His problem is he still doesn’t want it as bad as you. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I promise boss. She’s not just some idiotic rich girl with too much time on her hands.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah. So about these other hobs…” <EOS>
<BOS> Fortunately you’re mostly protected by your clothing, though you’re still picking glass out of bits of your body. However, you don’t do that for long since you notice the diamond necklace that has now been released from its cage. You might as well grab that instead. <EOS>
<BOS> It is the farthest you have traveled since your honeymoon with Ivani, when the to of you traveled south to the Kingdom of Avala and played in the hot springs there and took in the sights. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> “I mean like the girl would literally explode into chunks gore and blood, when your ex arrived and chances are your ex wouldn’t be too happy with you either and you probably wouldn’t have much time to get out of her immediate vicinity before she killed you too.” <EOS>
<BOS> You should have just hijacked it. <EOS>
<BOS> "Not at your stop," he laughs. "That'll be a couple weeks, yet. We make the rounds of Gloaming Isle and Castille, first, before we head back round to the northern continent of Redsand." <EOS>
<BOS> A couple of weapons that catch your eye are a pair of ornate looking dagger. Not even tarnished and definitely still usable. You probably could easily pry them from the walls though you’d have to reach a bit since they’re little higher than you. <EOS>
<BOS> You wish Tanya was still around. You’d love to share your success with her, but you guess that she moved on a long time ago. She claimed you’d move on, but you haven’t. How could you? She was everything to you. If it wasn’t for her, it’s debatable that you would have even did any of this. You probably would have fucked around in Holgard for a few years and then just left when the Ebony Claw Syndicate started taking notice of you. She kept you around and made you fall in love with her. <EOS>
<BOS> "So...what then? We just settle into life of married mediocrity and live the rest of our lives like average assholes?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Zal, Vaughn, come on. We’re going to deal with this crazy bitch and I want you both with me in case she gets ideas to sic her goblin buddies on me.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Your first thought is to head west to the city-state of Klyton. It’s certainly the closest city and it’s the direction you ran from Teckleville anyway. The problem is if anyone from Teckleville is still searching for you, that’s going to be the first place they look. <EOS>
<BOS> “Daughter of Neroth! Embrace your true heritage and kill this sacrifice in the name of your dark father! We shall all bask in the glory of your transformation!” Reginald shouts followed by several of his followers. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m telling you, we really should bring slave market back. It brought in a lot of coin when it existed and I’m fairly certain I could convince some of those Hessla pirates to bring their business here again.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> “See? Told ya I’d get ya to Holgard.” Warts proudly remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “You didn’t even know who the hell she was until she was promoted to midwife and babysitter. Which is amazing since she’s one of our older members that stuck with us since Holgard.” <EOS>
<BOS> Finally you see Mr. Reynolds and he certainly hasn't changed. Once again he stands up smiling at his desk. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, you’re leaving the city?! Why? Where are you going to go? Did you intend on telling me?” <EOS>
<BOS> "I don't understand why they would care. Wouldn't they just be glad to get their money?" you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Still at a heightened state of alert, you stab at whoever it is behind you, and just manage to nick their arm before twisting away. <EOS>
<BOS> "WATCH IT WITH THOSE! You break one of those wheels and I'm going to break your fucking arms! By the gods, I'm surrounded by fucking incompetents! And what the hell are you doing? Are you fucking retarded or something? Don't just stand around with a thumb up your ass, go fucking help Vaughn!" You shout in between hitting one poor employee desperately trying to get out of your way. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hold on, hold on. We had a good night. No need for all this, let’s just get back to Tom, okay?” Vaughn says getting a little bit in between the pair of you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Gee thanks, sis.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes, Annie said that it was actually yours and if I wanted to buy it, that I should speak with you. They mentioned how you used to work for my father too, so I figured I'd at least make an offer to you first before anyone else." <EOS>
<BOS> “I guess I had hope and I had to try. Stupid I guess.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Not the most noble of ends, but still better than most in our line of work. And if it’s any consolation, Sydicate leadership was thinking about having you done away with eventually anyway. Honestly, they should have done it a long time ago, but…well I’m but a servant to a greater purpose.” <EOS>
<BOS> Of course since this is your first time here, you’re still getting used to all the twisting corridors that this university seems to favor. You end up stepping into a class in session a couple times, before stumbling upon an unattended supply room where you pilfer various bottles of pills and liquids. <EOS>
<BOS> “Your son hasn’t been cursed by Fel, quite the opposite in fact. Your son has actually been blessed by him and he’s now displaying the affects.” Gertrude says. <EOS>
<BOS> "You don't want anyone to come with you?" Zal asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I’m still going to need convincing if this is something we need to get into. So you’ll need to persuade me why this is worth pursuing AND I don’t mean with your body.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, let’s take this drug dealing trash back to Sivak.” The sergeant says, still hanging on to the Blue Dream package. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, though as I noticed before, you don’t seem to be a physical type…not to say you aren’t well proportioned for a young man your age, it’s just I was hoping to get a taker from the gladiator team or someone of similar intimidating size. I only mentioned this at all to you because for one, I haven’t had anyone else come in as strange as that may be. And two I knew your father. I figured it wouldn’t be polite to not offer his son a chance to earn some money towards his education goals, whatever they may be. You could even get a jump start on potential class credits.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh, him? That disgusting little grub owns a tavern? Thought he lived here in the sewers. In fact I was wondering why he wasn't in the ring fighting with the other bums." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You run a good distance through some trees, but you soon find yourself very winded and you have to stop. You don’t hear anything following you, so you take that as a good sign. <EOS>
<BOS> Sparks fill the lightless interior igniting the hand torch. Not every man holds one, but the torches are positioned well throughout the line of men to illuminate each man’s vision. Fallen braziers line the walls, along with crumpled tapestries. <EOS>
<BOS> Warts continues to remain silent about his situation as you keep the pistol trained on him. Night begins to fall and once again you begin to get agitated. <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course not, but I trust the fact that I know how to lay it down good enough that he told me all this stuff in the bedroom without me even asking.” <EOS>
<BOS> You pause for a moment. You’ve gone over this scenario in the past a few times and you already know the answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, I’d rather not. Without going into too much detail, I tried to have company over once when she wasn’t around and she pitched a bitch about it. And given what I’ve got in store for you, it’s going to be real obvious I’ve had someone over. Hell, we might not even be done by the time she gets back.” <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t know. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not gonna be the easy way I can tell you that, and if you attempt to do this the hard way, you’ll have a bullet in your head before you can make another step.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Indeed. I’ll see you both soon.” Flynn says and leaves. <EOS>
<BOS> Warts shakes his head unconvinced and continues to cover himself. You have to admit, if you didn’t know he was there, you probably wouldn’t notice him if you were just wandering by. <EOS>
<BOS> You turn around and open fire managing to hit one of your assailants while the others duck behind the walls. <EOS>
<BOS> "Sandrella - not this world, but its guardian, our mother - she is keeping us alive. She feeds us stories and dreams, bit by bit, in hopes it will someday be enough. She will not let me go, yet this existence is meaningless, and only causes sorrow. But with your power, and what is left of mine, we could give all to Ivani. She would rise, free, alive - able to go forward and tend to the despairing world. We would turn to dust, and finally be free." <EOS>
<BOS> “Well what about Lord Reginald?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Not exactly...” <EOS>
<BOS> “What do ya think happened? I told ‘im you left for Holgard and he thanked me with some coin and took off. I suppose if you’re quick, you might be able to catch him on the road to Holgard.” Virgil says. <EOS>
<BOS> You poke your head out to view the landscape. While the climb is steep, the rocks are jagged, leaving a fair amount of hand-holds for climbers. The seeming break in security would have you worried if not for the disarming of several traps along the way. Any intruder would be meet with death -- though not so swift, depending on the trap they sprung. You tie your longsword to your pack to prevent it from falling out and begin the climb. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ha ha. Fuck you. Next week.” Gil says waving bye to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, from what I heard, you weren’t exactly friendly with them.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, but he’s the only one standing outside in da sewers and he looks half dead.” <EOS>
<BOS> “The love of his life, school girl killed him.” Zal says. <EOS>
<BOS> "I think I got a potential suggestion." Zal says. <EOS>
<BOS> The two of you soon get to it and it’s fairly interesting. Tanya might be a virgin, but she’s obviously a natural. Of course being half succubus might have something to do with that. <EOS>
<BOS> “What I’m saying is it was fucking sloppy and you’re not half as good as you think you are.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well there was a time when it didn’t and that’s mainly due to Neroth. Neroth was like the opposite of Joachim. Good verses evil type shit. People forget that it was only a couple hundred years ago when the Church of Joachim was burning and crusading on a regular basis due to their desire to stomp out any followers of Neroth and things they generally tied to him such as the supernatural. Nowadays the Joachimites are generally peace loving pacifists for the most part, but that’s only due being mostly successful in destroying those that follow Neroth and then subsequently going so overboard that some of the Joachimites finally realized they needed to rein it in before they became like their hated enemies.” <EOS>
<BOS> But that woman wasn’t Tanya. Last night was just you and some beautiful stranger under the effects of a powerful aphrodisiac that pushed the limits of your endurance. <EOS>
<BOS> But, you still need something to draw them in and make them feel a part of the tale. Those who are invested in a story are more likely to open their hearts to it - and their wallets. <EOS>
<BOS> You get the strong impression that she’d rather not help you at all and just would rather reap the benefits. Which at this point might at least be easier on you since you’d be able to work in peace, though if that was the case, why the hell would you need to give her any of it? You’d be better off alone and keep everything. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well, even if that is the case, I don’t see staying here in Teckleville robbing travelling merchants as a stable future.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you exit the medical school, you decide to call it a night and head home since you figure if you need to get up in the morning in three days, then you’re going to have “fix” your internal clock again so you don’t over sleep. <EOS>
<BOS> “Claire! Where’s the nearest brothel in this city?!” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> "...Are you being serious right now?" <EOS>
<BOS> Virgil pats you on the back and then stumbles off. <EOS>
<BOS> You nod silence and with a somewhat uplifted spirit. <EOS>
<BOS> From beyond the veil, the voice speaks from underneath a dark hood. The red shadows cast by the lamps outline the entire hunched figure in a sanguine glow. <EOS>
<BOS> You wake up fairly early, but then you didn’t really sleep much to begin with. This was more of a brief rest anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> You fill the rest of the page with sweet nothings, and a few of your fondest memories, hoping the paper's magic will keep them locked in black ink. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thank me? For what?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait a minute…you’re telling me you’re actually bastard royalty?!” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> You take her words under advisement, which is much more reasonable than she hoped for. You know she’s right after all; it isn’t going to do anyone any good if you’re in the state you’re in now. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t know. Not really. I would like to have a close relationship with you, I probably have even before the cultist incident. I mean now especially considering I know nearly everything about your life just like you know most of mine. Like you said, we’ve practically been dating, just without the hassle of going out.” <EOS>
<BOS> Nimi immediately says Elias who once again protests to the point where he’s looking like he’l get violent. Meanwhile Zamed tells them both to shut up. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…and you stay exactly like that when I return.” You reply and close the door. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey boss, dat Dusky shadow iz at the door sayin he’s got important news about the task you sent him on.” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> "No, I claim it!" the priestess insists. <EOS>
<BOS> The man who was recruiting is still visible, so you hurry your pace to catch up to him. You say you'll join and he is glad you changed your mind. He mentions his name is Scully and leads you to the Steadfast. <EOS>
<BOS> "Didn't know you had ongoing long distance relationship, Zal." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Most obvious though is her wings. They started off as two little lumps on her back that you noticed during one of your intimacy sessions. The next time you saw her, she had two small wings and are probably going to get even larger. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, the bad news is much worse than that.” Teklis says. <EOS>
<BOS> Mentally preparing yourself, you head to Tom’s office, though when you think more about it, you don’t know why you’re mentally preparing yourself. It isn’t like Tom’s going to even threaten to kill you if he doesn’t agree with what you have to say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I know. You wouldn’t want sex with me.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Oh yeah? Well you better come closer and prove that because I'm not convinced." <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t know much about the Raggedy Man inn except it’s in an even worse part of Klyton than you already stay at. Klyton might have militia patrols marching all over the place, but they’re still lax in certain areas. Makes you a bit wary that a large man wants to meet you there. You can’t imagine your father or mother would send someone like that, let alone want him to meet you under HIS conditions. Your sister maybe? Possible you suppose, but you’re skeptical. <EOS>
<BOS> “Kassi, tap out,” a male voice echoes across the training mat. You look to see Brother Samuel, although you make sure to keep the choke first. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’ll be the day,” Seth laughs. <EOS>
<BOS> "You're going to regret this." He says and then backs away slowly towards the door as likeminded folks follow. <EOS>
<BOS> “We’re taking that temple and as for the JCR, there hasn’t been any real aggression yet. I mean from what you’ve said, they aren’t really united except in defense against assimilation. Unless they attack, we’ll hold off for now, and perhaps in time, we can lure some over without the need for combat. There will be a day of reckoning though.” <EOS>
<BOS> Already dazed and scared from the crash, upon seeing you standing menacingly over her with a blunderbuss in hand she reacts without even thinking that you MIGHT potentially be helping her rather than robbing her. (Though that was a correct assumption on her part because you totally were going to rob her) <EOS>
<BOS> Hobs are great at protection, but not much for conversation (And unfortunately most of them DO get sick on the trip, apparently hobs don’t take well to sailing), so you mainly just do a lot of thinking about what you’re going to say to Peter when you finally meet him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, she might as well have placed her faith in Dorna rather than you for all good either would do her. The Dornans do have powerful magic to be sure, but they are poor fighters. Evening the odds with this object and they stand no chance. I’m going to personally enjoy this I believe and you’ve proven that our alliance is indeed a strong one. We will strike their temple in force. I want to make sure none escape, then we’ll destroy it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s fine. I probably should spend more time with him anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit…it was you. You were the…” <EOS>
<BOS> With those last words you leave. <EOS>
<BOS> You make her a final glass of bloodwine, for old times sake, then bid Lyria farewell. <EOS>
<BOS> She goes on to say that she’ll be in Holgard in a few months with her usual cut. She says when she gets there you and her should speak more on this since it’s a conversation that should take place in person. <EOS>
<BOS> With this goal in mind, you backtrack around Teckleville, maintaining caution the entire time. You stick mainly to wooded areas, hoping that you not only don’t run into someone from Teckleville trying to hunt you down, but potentially anything worse. You’ve never really been big on hanging out in the wilderness after all so you don’t know what to expect. <EOS>
<BOS> Then you soon feel the bolt in your back being forcefully pulled out, followed by her hand touching the wound and burning it, causing you to yell out. You close your eyes and breathe hard for a moment trying to ignore the pain and then you’re suddenly lifted up. <EOS>
<BOS> As Gwen picks her sniveling boyfriend off the floor, Heather tells the other wizards behind her to return to their lessons and approaches you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Madeline! Hold on! I…can’t…WE can’t do this. I think you’ve gotten the wrong idea!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because I’m fucking cursed that’s why and that’s what I should have just told you. If I had maybe this could have all been avoided.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh come on! I think given your increasing hostility towards me this is going beyond a father-daughter type of protectiveness. You’re acting like a jealous boyfriend or something. I’m succeeding where you and so many others obviously failed.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve heard of those before. Klyton apparently uses them when the jails are full and the criminal hasn’t done anything bad enough to deserve outright death. So they get put in these cages until they eventually die of starvation, exposure or someone grants the mercy of killing them. Either way they aren’t the city’s problem anymore. Seems like it would be kinder to kill them immediately. <EOS>
<BOS> "Ah, an internal struggle? Interesting. Well, I'm not sure what you want me to do about it." <EOS>
<BOS> "So what about the location? Are we buying out an existing inn or starting from scratch? We could probably buy back the old place, the Troll's Breath Tavern. Edmond used to run the Talons from there before the militia raided the place and shut it down." Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> You enter the magic school which is still relatively empty and head to Ahmed’s lab. When you arrive, you see Ahmed speaking with a very well dress man with a goatee. They both turn towards you. <EOS>
<BOS> As you finish dumping the contents into your pack, you’re about to check the rest of the house, and that’s when you suddenly hear the front door open! What the fuck!? Did she actually come home already? <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well, I’m here now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well unless you’re somehow suddenly transforming into a young girl that’s willing to suck my dick on a regular basis, you don’t get to stay for free.” <EOS>
<BOS> And once she gets the general idea of her new surroundings, her eyes finally meet yours. <EOS>
<BOS> You start following Warts who leads the way. <EOS>
<BOS> "That's your problem, not mine!" <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve also made a nice profit from your dabbling in the drug trade. You even managed to perhaps get the Bloody Talons off your back since you sold to a lone Talon who seemed agreeable to the idea that maybe he could convince others to leave you alone if you managed to get more of the stuff. (You still aren’t allowed to work on their turf though) <EOS>
<BOS> “We understand,” Sarah says. “I’m sorry for my reaction. Make yourself at home. I’ll bring you some tea.” <EOS>
<BOS> “SHIT!” you shout and go to get the door open, but you’re suddenly pulled back by a clawed hand and slammed to the floor hard. <EOS>
<BOS> “We’ll grab a couple more Talons on the way out, but we’re not going to be bushwacked like Camid and I know we’re much better fighters. As soon as we kill a few of those green buggers they’ll probably start running away. We’ll be fine. Now let’s get this shit done.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> This guy reminds you of Klint, another bully who thinks he can just talk shit louder than everyone else to scare them into submission. Well, it ultimately didn’t work out for Klint and if Jake makes this difficult for you, it’s not going to work out for him as well. <EOS>
<BOS> “So what? You gonna be the one to do that? Pfft. Fuck you kid. You tried to pull that I’m a killer shit when you first met me in that hanging cage. Didn’t buy it then and I’m certainly not buying it now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Seriously?” <EOS>
<BOS> The military soldiers look at each other and the one that grabbed you pulls you off the wall and begins motioning you to go. <EOS>
<BOS> Lusang's horses won the third event, a quarter mile race with hurdle jumps, his light horses practically flying over the jumps. Rom's horses came in last, for they knocked over hurdles in their excitement. <EOS>
<BOS> "Do give us an example!" she asks, digging in to a roasted chicken with her bare hands. "Something with a coffin." <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sigh) And how exactly was I going to do that while I was breaking into his lockbox in his tent? The whole point is for me not to attract any sort of attention and that’s getting more difficult to do what with a lot of the merchants hiring more guards nowadays.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re still at the camp, not having set foot in the city yet and you’re starting to wonder if this was a good idea. You might have to hire pirates and mercenaries to finish this job if things continue to go this way. <EOS>
<BOS> You have no idea if you’re even going to have an organization left if you survive all this, but that doesn’t matter right now. Right now you’re going to do something even more foolish and find out what the hell’s going on with Heather and her crew of wannabes because if you can get the wizards to help you in this chaos, staying here will have at least been worth the effort. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t worry about me. You just try to relax as I take care of everything. Let’s go over there, that looks like a secluded spot.” <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, you’re done with Klyton, and this whole job attempt… <EOS>
<BOS> Without thinking you stab Klint in the neck. Blood trickles from his mouth, his eyes glance over to you and then he falls back to the ground with the knife still in his neck. <EOS>
<BOS> “Damn it’s really good to see you! It’s been too long!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> Honestly, you aren’t sure how good your ring is going to be, but you hope it’s good enough to keep you alive. If nothing else, they aren’t surviving this. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re an underworld boss who not only orchestrated the downfall of the Thieves Guild, but also the Ebony Claw Syndicate chapter in this city. THEN you created your own organization, which has quickly started to gain the same influence as the ECS once did here. You are also known to be very dangerous with firearms, particularly your custom made one. While you’re probably not important in the grand scheme of the world, you’re definitely important in this city at least.” <EOS>
<BOS> Jake tackles you to the ground and you try to throw another punch, but this time Jake catches your fist. His grip is very strong. A lot stronger than you thought he’d be actually. <EOS>
<BOS> You suppose Annah’s lack of skill has had the benefit of increasing your own since you’ve definitely had to be quicker and sneakier. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well as I said, I’m really glad to see you. Come on in and sit down.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s fine. Anyway, looks like I’ll need to get some more hobs on the payroll.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Thanks. I’m really going to do my best to make this work.” <EOS>
<BOS> The prospect makes you nervous, but it is essentially free passage. So, for weeks, you travel alongside Lyria, stopping a few times to take in the sights or so you can tell a story. <EOS>
<BOS> “EY! Don’t shoot!” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Trust me, I’m made my decision and she deserves this and I fucking deserve my freedom.” <EOS>
<BOS> Warts can stay and get drunk here if he wants, but you’re not sticking around. You’re also not leaving without something for your trouble, you take Wart’s pack on a table stuffed with bottles and leave. <EOS>
<BOS> Afterwards, the pair of you fall asleep under the stars. <EOS>
<BOS> “Meh, I was done with him anyway. I suppose I’ll be taking another ship back to Jicol though.” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s strange you suppose, but you get the urge to write to your parents. You don’t give them all the details, but you tell them that you’re doing okay and that you’re finally “settling down” with a family of your own. You also apologize for how events unfolded that caused you to leave in the first place and that you know that they both tried to raise you the best they could and were lucky to have them for parents. <EOS>
<BOS> For whatever reason, the DK hasn’t taken any action against him, whether that’s because the cost wouldn’t be worth it, they’ve got more important things to deal with or they’re simply glad to have him gone is unknown. The third possibility isn’t entirely out of the question either, since you’ve overheard travelling merchants say that Baron Varsakken is a very unlikable man and it’s amazing he hasn’t suffered any assassination attempts. His children are apparently little better. <EOS>
<BOS> You can only imagine that it’s just a matter of time before they come sniffing around here eventually. Maybe it won’t happen, but better that you be prepared so you don’t end up like the Thieves’ Guild or the JRC since that would be quite the ironic fate indeed. <EOS>
<BOS> You look at their faces. Some of them laugh nervously, others bury their heads in their cups, and still others are genuinely more interested in the food. But two people meet your gaze: a stiff man bearing the crest of a minor mage, thin faced and tight lipped; and the little girl in her wooden chair, her eyes shining bright as she eagerly raises a hand. He would have deeper pockets, and likely represent the sentiments of the adults more accurately, but she looks genuinely interested in hearing a good story. <EOS>
<BOS> “What about all these valuable bottles of wine? An’ ya haven’t even checked da upstairs yet!” <EOS>
<BOS> It's the people. They are in chaos. It seems half of them wear a distinctive color - either gold or blue, to show which faction they are in. From what you gather, the golds are those loyal to the mages, and the blues are those loyal to the muses. Everyone else seems to duck their head as they walk, as if afraid to be called upon and asked to choose a side. <EOS>
<BOS> Brother Samuel turns to see a white glowing light. The wisp, the Master of Archives, shines disapprovingly. Not many would be able to tell an approving shine versus a disapproving one, but Brother Samuel is not unaccustomed to the one before him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Bah! All those bolts and you lot couldn’t hit a behemoth’s butt with a bass fiddle! I told you fuckers to practice! Just fucking close in for the kill!” you hear someone shout. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright, fine. I’ll inform her…I have to ask though. How come you don’t like Zal?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Damn it! Don’t fucking follow us! Spread out! Spread out! Everyone spread out!” you shout at the various members also running in your direction. <EOS>
<BOS> And that’s it. There’s nothing more to it. You’d like to forget about this dark day as soon as possible, but you know that’s going to take a bit of time. <EOS>
<BOS> "Perhaps, but they're going to be pretty mad about this and when they are, I can't say I'm going to entirely blame them. Still, we can deal with that later. Right now, priority is making this place respectable before the Klyton militia sweep." <EOS>
<BOS> Asshole, <EOS>
<BOS> “You put up a fight and you may not be the only casualty. Hand Kol over and I can assure you that your son will most likely have a better life than he would with you. The priests will probably see him as a chosen of Fel or something. Surely you would rather have your son be in his own position of power some day rather than a dead brat at the bottom of the Jicol bay.” <EOS>
<BOS> I was a young man when we first met, and younger at heart. The world was bursting with life and color. Our wedding was secret, our love was quiet - but we both new that our children would bring about a new era. One of peace and imagination, creation and ingenuity. The star poison interrupted our plans. And while you saved the world, everything good and colorful about it went with you. I no longer dream. I forget small things that were once important to me. The tales I spin, that once entertained you, now vanish as soon as I say them. <EOS>
<BOS> While you expect to be killed right there in the streets, the soldiers eventually stop beating you and take you away in chains. Apparently they uphold a very civilized legal system here and you are to be properly judged rather than just executed immediately. <EOS>
<BOS> Pelliandra waved a hand, transforming the seashell into something thinner and lighter. "You may wear this on your back, if you wish, and take a home with you wherever you go." <EOS>
<BOS> After Marco leaves, Kol who is in the room suddenly speaks up. <EOS>
<BOS> "Just the storm so far," you laugh, "I'm on my way to the Grove of the Muses. I'm sure I will have many adventures along the way." <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t understand why you’re fucking with me, don’t you have an usurper to sabotage?” you blurt out getting frustrated. <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course you will, that’s how I meant it. Anyway, I gotta go. Garrick’s holding some sort of meeting for some of us important elite. Tell ya what, I’ll try to convince Garrick to let you in the Guild’s inner sanctum already. I know it’s not Tanya’s inner sanctum, but here’s something that might help you in that goal, she’s supposed to be casing the Museum of the Ancients tonight. Who knows, maybe if you get there quick enough she might even let you help.” <EOS>
<BOS> Doesn’t take long before people are running and screaming about the city sinking since whatever happened, the streets are being filled with water. You can probably guess what happened though. The Jicol Watch went ahead and fumbled down in Sneaks’ rat maze and probably triggered a trap, which collapsed the tunnels just like you figured they would. <EOS>
<BOS> Now you’re alone with Tanya who doesn’t look pleased with you. You’re about to speak when she suddenly grabs you and suddenly jumps in the air and takes to flight. Using her wings as a shield she envelopes herself (and you) as she breaks through the ceiling of the school. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…” you say still looking at Jake before walking past. <EOS>
<BOS> “So what then? You telling me YOU know how to talk better to my woman than I do? Is that what you’re getting at?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Okay. Let's stop right there. The underground city is probably a long damn way off. Don't even think about it. We're going to start simple and get more complex later. Tell you what we're going to do..." <EOS>
<BOS> She looks more like a demonic knight of some sort rather than her succubus origins would imply. One of the few things though that remains recognizable to you is her long white hair and her face. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I figured he was just talking shit anyway…(Sigh) anyway this is a mess. I’m glad to see you escaped town though.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Or even how much you might be in love with me?” you answer. <EOS>
<BOS> After dropping two more Imperial soldiers, you find yourself face to face with a tall, hulking frame. Upon seeing the threat in front of him, the man raises his tower shield, covering all but his eyes. His tan skin illuminates the two white white eyes peering at you like two diamonds on black velvet. With a short grunt, he attacks, pushing you off balance with the tower shield, and following up, quickly, with a swipe of his battle axe. You block the axe, but not how you would have liked due to the shield bash. The full force of the axe absorbs through your sword into your arm, sapping some of your strength. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sort of surprised Elias didn’t use her as a personal fuck hole if he was the one that brought her here.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Just a minor trainee," he says, "but I'm not about to let them hold you for ransom or allow a kidnapping. Merchants were once the bringers of culture and ethics, not just marketable goods - it's why I became one. But it's changed a lot in the past few years." He signs. "But we're here. Let me do the talking. I'll meet you back here just before sun-up, so don't sleep in." <EOS>
<BOS> Without thinking you look at the waters below and see a couple of splashes and a glimpse of a large fishtail. <EOS>
<BOS> You manage to stand up and through the squinting, you notice a piece of paper on the nightstand. You notice there’s writing on it and after rubbing your eyes a bit; you read it even though you have somewhat of an idea of what’s happened. <EOS>
<BOS> "What the fuck do you want?" She asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You figured there was no immediate point in sending one to Jicol since in the few letters Vera sent back she’s given you brief reports herself and says that everything has been going better there and she’s suffered no visits from the ECS, which you’re glad to hear since you were sure she would. <EOS>
<BOS> Other than being a smaller ship, it doesn't look like it's falling apart so it's at least in good shape. Feels weird just being on it though you don't feel sick. Hopefully you won't when it's actually sailing. <EOS>
<BOS> It suddenly occurs to you that you’ve never really tried the university district of the city. Might be worth a look, after all it should be filled with stupid rich kids not aware of their surroundings and the Talons don’t seem to go running around there, so there might be less heat overall. <EOS>
<BOS> “Y’know what I’ve been thinking? I think you’re fucking imagining things. I think all those girls were just a bad coincidence and you jumped to conclusions because as I said, you’re still holding a torch for your ex and felt guilty about it.” Vera responds. <EOS>
<BOS> Still despite all this, you do have real feelings for Madeline. Maybe it’s because you left Annah when she was in trouble that you don’t want to do the same thing to Madeline. At the very least, you want to be able to give HER the choice. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh I don’t mean to say they won’t have talent at all, but I can imagine in a place like this that they won’t be the most disciplined of magic users. It’s really not their fault and at least they have practical experience rather than that dying school in Klyton where all they seemingly do is read old dusty books and argue about theory all day.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I can’t believe you even meant it. Y’know before all this shit went down, I was actually thinking about breaking up with you in the first place. And guess what, I was right about…” <EOS>
<BOS> "Mummy, who is it?" <EOS>
<BOS> “This just gets better and better. Tell me, are you going to be jacking your old wrinkled dick the whole time too?” <EOS>
<BOS> You fight the instinct to immediately go for your weapon, not that you’d be fast enough anyway since two of them have already grabbed your arms, while another takes your bag and all your weapons. <EOS>
<BOS> “I was starting to wonder when you’d ever try to get off the island. There was a bet going on that you would come here to try to assassinate me, but I always knew you’d try to run. It was the smartest play after what happened of course. What took you so long?” <EOS>
<BOS> “YOU MURDERER!” a gruff voice shouts from behind. <EOS>
<BOS> However, at this point you just want to see Tanya again. Looks like she didn’t leave your thoughts completely. <EOS>
<BOS> After a few days of taking care of your mundane tasks you catch the next carriage out of Klyton and you’re soon on your way. <EOS>
<BOS> Seth hasn’t steered you wrong yet. True, he isn’t a typical role model – he breaks far too many rules to call him that, but his loyalty and devotion is unwavering. Those, truly, are what you try to imitate. His actions may be questionable at times, but his character never is. Still, you understand your role. Seth is the teacher and you are the student. It is your duty to follow his instruction – and leadership. You finish training by meditating on the task ahead, visualizing the upcoming battle. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey you, this isn’t a fucking Purple Wish Den! This place is for wizards only!” a pimply faced young man says. The young woman with him gives you a dirty look with an amused sneer. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah sits next to you on the bed and holds one of your hands. This must be serious. <EOS>
<BOS> They slowly surround you, creating a deadly circle with you at the center. You see the faces of men you’ve fought beside, bled with, buried your comrades with. They don’t recognize the man before them, the vessel filled and embodied by evil. Their leader is gone, and his replacement is the very darkness mothers scare their children with. You cannot scream, you cannot move, you cannot react. The Unbroken is in control. He strikes them down with pleasure at your lips. He doesn’t finish them fast, each man is given several cuts before finishing the final blow. <EOS>
<BOS> “Given all the security you set off, it’s apparent you didn’t think at all! I was just on my way to leave when I heard glass breaking and the scampering of your feet. Did you really think you could just smash and grab shit in a place like that without consequence?” <EOS>
<BOS> You turn and see Gertrude standing nearby with the people you came with and all of them are pointing flintlocks at you. <EOS>
<BOS> You have your doubts about that, though Warts stands up without too much trouble. <EOS>
<BOS> When you wake up, you’re in a chair at a table with Rook sitting across from you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Who the hell is that guy?” one of the bandits shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> "Good luck," one of the women whispers, then goes back to bed. <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose my skills would come in handy for such a task.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, but I don’t need to physically be there and I hope I never do. I saw enough based on what my mother showed me and I resisted the lure of it then and I’m going to continue to do so.” <EOS>
<BOS> “The usual way I suspect.” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Keira makes a minor laugh and waves at the woman, though you notice Keira also rolling her eyes when she turns her head away. <EOS>
<BOS> If she isn’t then you’ll move on to someone else. If she is, well you’ll have to remember not to try to kill her and blackout about it. <EOS>
<BOS> “So what exactly was the plan anyway? How did she even trust you enough?” Gloom asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, well I guess that concludes our business then. So, since you were so efficient on this job, could I count on you for others in the future?” <EOS>
<BOS> “No…I mean you REALLY fucked up. Like seriously fucked up. But I guess in your own warped way you thought you were doing something good. Actually I don’t even understand it all, but it really doesn’t matter since maybe some of this is my fault. I should have told you a long time ago.” <EOS>
<BOS> “For the sake of argument, let’s say I agree to this. I still don’t see how this helps me all that much. I’m going to be taking most of the risk and damage and if anything the Syndicate might get a little suspicious if I start wiping out former allies.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I see…is this true?” Heather asks Vera. <EOS>
<BOS> “Lloyd, I’ve honestly only known you only a little longer than I’ve known this guy. YOU were sent here from the Delantium Kingdom as so called help with the money matters and all that other shit. For all I know you’ve been sent here to spy on me and setting me up to fail.” <EOS>
<BOS> "That's an interesting thought," you laugh, "but I'm just an ordinary man." <EOS>
<BOS> You wish you had known Yinen was the inquisitor the whole time. Maybe you could have spoke to him. Maybe not. Doesn’t matter now, it’s done. <EOS>
<BOS> Mr. Reynolds goes on to explain that while Junior doesn't have the same size as his father or quickness that Henry has, he assures you that he has more than enough skill to do the job you require. However, unlike last time Mr. Reynolds asks for a thousand gold coins in advance. <EOS>
<BOS> By the time Spryce returns, Elzu has passed out. It's a mercy, as your rough treatment can only bring him more pain. You take your own cloak and douse it in the water, cleaning his torso as best you can. Tearing the robe into strips, you tightly bandage most of the wound, leaving some at the top exposed. With the curved needle and the wire, you begin to close the wound. When you reach the edge of the bandages, you move a couple more aside and retie those strips over the stitched section, then carry the zig-zag down across the newly acessible portion. In this method you, slowly, bring the shredded skin together and minimize the blood flow as best you can. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well now, I wouldn't say that exactly, I still have one employee willing to cause mayhem on your behalf." <EOS>
<BOS> "I wish I could go!" He sits up and props his chin on his elbows. <EOS>
<BOS> Your days as a rogue are over. <EOS>
<BOS> "Boss? We're not Crimson Talons anymore remember?' <EOS>
<BOS> You keep up the brisk pace for the remainder of the night, which soon starts turning to day again. You also can now see a break in the trees. You’ve finally reached the end of this blasted forest and a large walled city is now in sight! <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh.” <EOS>
<BOS> Your agent then gives you a sealed letter saying Teklis provided details for you within it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I guess I’ll start at the beginning. Let’s see…what do you know of Peter Varsakken? Youngest son of Vlad.” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> But something deeper calls you now. You try to fight it, ending up with a mind divided, half of it wrestling to find a way to save Ivani, while the other half is drawn elsewhere. <EOS>
<BOS> “Bah, fine. You’re lucky I got more important shit to do.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah. I see.” <EOS>
<BOS> You do have one idea, but it’s a long shot and possibly one that could get you killed immediately. You could go try to talk to the head of the Temple of Fel. You don’t know exactly what you’d say, but your hope would be to try to convince him that supporting the Ebony Claw, isn’t in the best interest of the temple. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s the third large group of cultists we’ve had to evade in our own fucking sewers. Something needs to be done about those shitheads because not even the EC is giving us this much trouble down here.” Sneaks says. <EOS>
<BOS> However, she says she still has a lot of his notes and writing to go through, so she will try to find out how to do it and perhaps maybe there are other ways to lift it as well. <EOS>
<BOS> The next few days are a little tense and you stay on your guard. You half expect Camid or Madeline to do something crazy, try to kill you, or something that causes problems. None of that happens though. <EOS>
<BOS> You eventually stop worrying about it; it’s not going to matter anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> “What’s it to you? What? You didn’t think I could make it on my own did you?” <EOS>
<BOS> With this statement, Percy suddenly takes a small piece of parchment out of his pocket and moves it across the table. You take it and look at it. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, she did take the initiative and solve the main problem concerning you being together. That’s sort of an admirable trait. <EOS>
<BOS> Sneaks sighs a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Pity, might have been fun to deflower you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Good, and remember when a year is up you’re on your fucking own. If you want anything from us after that, you gotta pay just like everyone else or join, but we can talk about that later if you so desire. Now leave me, I got important shit to do.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I suppose I’ve been a bit busy what with fighting the ECS and all.” <EOS>
<BOS> Marco gives you the hard stare to which of course you’re quite unimpressed by. <EOS>
<BOS> Suddenly a voice speaks causing you both to look toward the entryway of the room. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya’s hand releases yours and moves over you to your face. You fully expect her to do something violent, but instead she just caresses your cheek. <EOS>
<BOS> “It would be dangerous.” You say as you enjoy the scent of her this close up. <EOS>
<BOS> You also had problems with not just a major storm, but a few larger ships that apparently thought it would be fun to open fire on you for the shits and giggles. Doesn't help that the navigator got killed during that exchange and you got severely off course while attempting to outrun the superior ships. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t know how long everything is black for, but it’s a long time. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah that is the question isn’t it? What DOES the Syndicate want? I bet ever since you heard from us, you’ve been wondering. Is this a threat? Is this a deal? Is this an alliance? Is it a prelude to an attack? What COULD it be? Why has the Syndicate suddenly taken an interest in Holgard again after it abandoned it a decade ago? Well? Do YOU have any ideas?” Percy asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Brother Samuel reaches his destination: the Grandmaster’s private study. The heavy oak door is reinforced with steel, barring unwanted entry. Samuel knows there are other deterrents to keep thieves or renegade monks out. He closes his eyes to focus on the seals. Magic flows from his open palms dispelling the deadly traps. He takes a coin from his pocket and looks at the door’s keyhole. He whispers into the coin, and the object transforms into a key. He unlocks the door and flips the key into the air. After several flips in the air, a coin lands into his open palm. <EOS>
<BOS> “For fuck’s sake people, this place is going to have traps up the ass, keep alert!” you shout. <EOS>
<BOS> “What do you mean?” <EOS>
<BOS> This is a lot to take in. You truly do not know what to make of all this. If this crown, or voice, or whatever is telling the truth, you are in deeper shit than you could have ever imagined. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, but I’m establishing how things are going to work already. THEY will wait for ME. They’re at my beck and call, not the other way around.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> “Garrick, it’s actually okay, I can…” Tanya says before Garrick interrupts her as well. <EOS>
<BOS> walking a pretty traitorous line as it is just by not telling anyone that they ever approached you, but then it isn’t like you can exactly tell them, can you? <EOS>
<BOS> Vera, realizing that she can’t run, tries to appeal to you. <EOS>
<BOS> bastard anymore than you liked your other crewmates. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good, you’re not dead yet. Now, you need to tell me who else was involved in this little scheme or I’m going to pop into that hag’s shop and buy something to keep you alive so I can torture the shit out of you until you DO tell me everything.” You threaten. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well, they’re too far away, and we could run into bandits and you wouldn’t be much help if they tried to gang rape me. I don’t want to be out here any longer than I have to be.” <EOS>
<BOS> “But without it, where would you be?” <EOS>
<BOS> And she’s fucking terrible. You feel like your ears are being raped. You suffer in silence as she continues to play horribly all the while thinking, she has to get better in her later years. <EOS>
<BOS> You cautiously take them while the Shadow Blade just continues to study you. <EOS>
<BOS> The closer you get to the palace the more grandiose everything is. You also notice the increase in guards and you and Vera are patted down more than once. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmm, yes I suppose there is no way of completely distancing yourself from such things. I’m glad you’re worldlier than you appear since I fear my assistant is a bit sheltered. Well, I suppose sheltered isn’t quite the right word, more like disconnected from reality on these matters. Elana’s a good student, but as I said, I fear if she went to Hessla by herself, she’d say something to the wrong person and soon find herself sold into sex slavery or something similar. Anyway, just make sure you get those Qweepas safe and sound here.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Then what the hell’s the problem?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Bolt.” <EOS>
<BOS> You look over to your left and see a medium sized chest. You cautiously open it and cough a bit when a smokey smell of charred flesh hits your nose. You then see a bunch of what looks to be blackened ears. Well some of them are a little more than just blackened ears and still have some of the side of the faces attached. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course it wasn’t so much going “legit” as it was the idea of having a place to run your activities without it being in an abandoned building or recently the fucking sewers. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well, if Elder Flynn thought it was good enough for me, it’s good enough for her.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Like not wasting her time playing a flute for one thing! She’s horrible at it anyway and when I helpfully point this out to save her time, she gets pissed at me!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Here are your weapons. Bolt told me that Rook said it was okay to give them back to you. I guess you’ll be needing them anyway if this place comes under attack by demons and all.” He says handing them over to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Madeline, I REALLY need to know what’s going on.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah yes. Your father may have been the late Baron Varsakken. Still, even if true, you’ve given yourself the title of countess rather than baroness.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ve been going on and on about myself and you haven’t told me about what’s going on with you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I guess we’ll see.” <EOS>
<BOS> So far though, she’s acting about how you’ve always known her to. You’re getting the impression that she might not be faking all of it or if she is, she’s doing a very good job. <EOS>
<BOS> Well he’s no orc, but you doubt if he’d be an easy fight either. The guy is predictably crazy jealous and you suppose to can understand his view point, but that doesn’t change the fact that for all you know he’s going to just take you out to a more secluded place and murder you there. <EOS>
<BOS> Traveling with the merchants is rough. They rise before dawn and stop after dusk, breaking only for a couple hours in the heat of the day to rest and water the camels. If you want to share in their food, you have to buy it. If you need an extra blanket  - the one they provided being as thin as your old skin - you have to buy it. And because a couple mages are traveling along with them as well, they won't allow you to tell stories at night. <EOS>
<BOS> You quickly start opening doors to rooms in the hopes that at least one of them is completely empty. After stumbling into a couple rooms that are in the process of being used, you finally find a small guest room that seems to be empty since apparently people are dispensing with notions of privacy and content on fucking in public. You quickly enter and try to get over your condition. <EOS>
<BOS> You manage to get away, but the qweepas haven’t given up yet. You end up getting a couple more leaping on you, which causes you to have to slow down your pace again to get them off. In the process, you drop your torch and fumble around in a corridor desperately trying to avoid an ignoble fate of getting eaten by these things. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya smiles a bit and then hugs you. A bit sudden, but certainly not unwelcome. You have to admit, you’re already glad you’ve made this decision even if you’re dreading the danger that’s to come from it. <EOS>
<BOS> “That was the source, yes. Wait, you seem like you know something about this.” <EOS>
<BOS> But worst yet, once you finally track down the city stable and carriage houses, you find there is a blockade! No passage is beinng permitted into Lantern Wood from the South side, and checkpoints are set up along the path to the northwest to ensure no one goes around to find an open entrance. Perhaps if you'd travelled through Redsand and taken the Disbrook ferry to Aselthorne, the way would be clear. But from Stone City, the mages have made it clear that they want no one visiting the Grove of the Muses. <EOS>
<BOS> Before you can have any further discussion, Marco comes back to you. <EOS>
<BOS> "WHAT?! Now THAT I didn’t know! They had another child?! When?!" You exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “Silence! I’m gonna enjoy this.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It did. At least for a time. In any case, all of my actions would seem to have been for naught since I’m here. While perhaps I believe outside influences are a corrupting influence on our faith, I must also be pragmatic if our faith is to survive in this city.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t think that’s a good idea because if you haven’t noticed, this is MY hiding spot! As for when the effects are going to wear off I have no idea. I just jerked off four times in a row and I’m still hard as a rock.” <EOS>
<BOS> “With a frog!” <EOS>
<BOS> Madeline briefly looks down at her own body. <EOS>
<BOS> You turn your head and see a man with a goatee in a red robe. A couple of other larger men in red robes stand behind him. <EOS>
<BOS> “This will be fine.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “The guy who stabbed my girlfriend... I had to run away from home after that.” <EOS>
<BOS> At first you think you’re going to die, but then you notice that you’re falling not just towards the city, but you’re over an area which looks to have some large trees. With a little luck, MAYBE you can slow your descent before hitting the ground. <EOS>
<BOS> Following her lead you make your way to the rope and quickly climb up it where you’re staring directly at Tanya’s ass the entire time. Again, probably a good thing since your focus isn’t on the invisible horrors that are desperately trying to get your attention by whispering demoralizing things in your ears to cause you to give up hope and stop trying to escape. <EOS>
<BOS> “I should have had the Watch stomp out your organization years ago while you were in your infancy.” He says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Me? I’m just Warts.” He answers picking his big nose. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey! It’s me! Open up!” Tom shouts, a few moments pass and a scruffy looking man rubbing his head opens the door. <EOS>
<BOS> "If I may add, Empress," you say, "three of your ardent admirers helped me come up with the prompts for this take. "Lady Kiria, Madam Zao, and Lady Vanya." <EOS>
<BOS> You see a row of cages and various torture devices along with dead bodies in most of them. <EOS>
<BOS> You swallow, not liking the implications of that. <EOS>
<BOS> “You wouldn’t be able to do that if it wasn’t for me teaching you,” she replies. <EOS>
<BOS> As with most ideas, everything has its pros and cons, you need to think about all this a lot more. You tell Warts and Vera this and while Warts happily leaves your office to go about his own hobbies, Vera stays behind. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Thanks for your confidence, but I think I can manage.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Just trying to lower my rent a bit. Hey, you got any more artsy friends that are into poetry and singing and shit like that?” <EOS>
<BOS> “The thing is with my record, I know I’m probably getting sentenced to be executed in a few months. There isn’t really anything anyone can do for me, so I might as well call in the last favor I have left for someone that it will help. Use it or lose it as they say.” Mr. Scars says. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t stick around as the five of them enter Elana’s room. Just as you’re about to head down the stairs, you hear a scream followed by something breaking and then some laughter. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t think there’s going to ever be a girl that does that.” <EOS>
<BOS> “The guy who drove you here. Sheesh, didn’t you even bother to ask his name? In fact you weren’t even supposed to be here, he said you’d probably be at the Sultry Siren fucking a whore or getting drunk given how much your boss was bitching at you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Naw, too far an’ I don’t wanna be on sum ship. Just thinkin’ about bein surrounded by water makes me queasy. I guess I’m gonna just look inta opening up that trading post in Spiderfang territory like Snuffit suggested I do not too long ago. Probably should be closer ta family anywayz.” <EOS>
<BOS> You remain deadpan and show no expression when this is brought up, but a deep anxiety wells up inside you and you fear the worst. <EOS>
<BOS> Unanswering, you pull yourself up and raise your arms defensively. Still smiling, Kassi lunges forward. You cover your face with your hands and hug your elbows in tight to protect your torso. Still, somehow, her strikes find their mark. One left hook finds its way to your temple temporarily stunning you. <EOS>
<BOS> "Marriage will be good idea, trust me. I've been a citizen of this city since birth. I even own a small place of residence." <EOS>
<BOS> Almost everyone else in the organization has some thoughts on the matter and most of them aren’t good. <EOS>
<BOS> With all that’s gone on, you completely forgot about all that. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh… fuck yeah. That’s what I’m talking about.” She pants as you enter inside her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I guess I’ll start at the beginning. Let’s see…what do you know of Peter Varsakken? Youngest son of Vlad.” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> Ragar fires a shadow bolt directly at Brother Samuel’s chest. Unable to move in time, Samuel closes his eyes preparing for the end and...nothing. He blinks his eyes open to find a hooded figure beside him. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s a sound plan. I will aid the attack on the capital. <EOS>
<BOS> “Let’s get on with this deal which I hope you know isn’t going to be the same one that Percy first proposed when you both first got here, however it’ll still be good for the Syndicate.” <EOS>
<BOS> Despite your rather aggressive dominance over Annah, you weren’t actually planning to do anything except scare her really bad, which you definitely succeeded in doing. Any ideas of battery, torture, murder or (as Annah usually believes), rape weren’t in the equation. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah surprisingly nods her head a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, that’s fucking Lloyd, but how is that fucking relevant t to your situation?” Rook exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?” <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s sweet dear, but if you show up there by yourself, Jake’s gonna kill you. If he see both of us there together, he’ll probably do worse than kill you. And more importantly he could even kill me, so no you’re not going. For once Tom made the right decision even if he’s hoping I probably get killed in the process.” Zal remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Organization?” <EOS>
<BOS> Refusing to give up you manage to get off one more shot before Elias’ people finally finish you off. <EOS>
<BOS> "Will you be doing the cleaning, finding the client, and making the sale? No. You weren't expecting full price, were you?" <EOS>
<BOS> So you write a letter back to the Klyton magic university and explain that you’ll be heading that way as soon as possible. You also write a letter to your agent there saying that you want her to meet you and make arrangements for when you arrive next week. <EOS>
<BOS> You suddenly slam Trobart up against the wall which surprises the hell out of him. <EOS>
<BOS> Tom and you walk up some stone stairs and Tom bangs on a sturdy looking wooden door. <EOS>
<BOS> Your voice continues to rise as you walk around the room admonishing your people. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hell, where’s his mouthy bitch at? Still would like to shut her up.” One of the men holding you up says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Well...a lot of time has passed and that sheriff who hated you is long dead now. Klint's father also isn't there anymore, so I think you're in the clear legally, but I wouldn't exactly say you're wanted if you know what I mean. Though Annah apparently still thinks highly of you." <EOS>
<BOS> You peer one eye open. “Yes.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Obviously. Cooper! Gwen! Step away from that man. I told you two before to never mistake your magic for invincibility. And that mindset works even more against you when you insist on being within reach of the head of the Nocturnal League. He could have very well killed the pair of you before I even showed up.” Heather says. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not saying we should get back together, because I dunno I guess you’re right, maybe we’re just not good like that. But we got history and I can’t ignore that. I don’t know anyone else in this city. Or at least nobody I really connect with. I still need ONE person that I really know in this city. Someone I can count on. So maybe… we can still work together from time to time?” <EOS>
<BOS> Then when you turn your head back forward, you nearly fall backwards when you see Tanya standing right in front of you. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I still haven’t found a way to undo your curse I’ve been really fucking busy lately in case you haven’t noticed.” Heather says. <EOS>
<BOS> As everyone starts to leave, you go up to Tanya and offer to help her on her assignment and that’s when you get a scolding voice again. <EOS>
<BOS> Reginald motions the two men to drag you to the room with the altar and large pentagram on the floor. When you enter, you’re thrown into said pentagram. A crowd of red robed individuals watches silently. <EOS>
<BOS> As you get closer to the palace, you start coming across more of the fighting again. This must be where the rest of the orc mercs were sent when they weren’t tearing up your shit. <EOS>
<BOS> MAYBE if you're lucky you might be able to pick the lock and escape, but you doubt if you'll just have access to your tools. Maybe you could do what Tom managed to do and convince a wanderer to release him...but then again you know how that situation ultimately ended for him. <EOS>
<BOS> You notice she’s putting aside a lot of the contents next to herself. <EOS>
<BOS> “Something funny?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “What about your guide gig?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Finish your cup, now. I can tell you enjoy it,” the Captain says. “It’s my job to read people, you see. I must know the intentions of my soldiers, but more importantly, our enemies. I can tell you don’t like it here. I can also tell you don’t have any ill-will towards the Empire, except maybe towards unsavory characters. It’s ok, I realize not all in our leader’s employ follow his divine plan. I think the same way. Pour yourself another cup, now.” <EOS>
<BOS> "So how did it go?" Zal asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You return to Rook who is currently going through a few of Lloyd’s books. Bolt is nowhere to be found, though for all you know he’s around somewhere in the room. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, it wasn’t incredibly hard to figure out. Where are all the goblins?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Nope. Never even had any problems in Hessla, despite its reputation. A lot of people think its some anarchic pirate paradise, but the place is probably just as orderly as Klyton. The Governor of Hessla has his own personal security force called the Headsmen to patrol the place. They’re a lot more draconian than the militia too. Usually they just execute offenders on the spot without trial.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What do I want? No comments about my beauty? No flirty statements? If I didn’t know better, I’d think you’d finally shaken off the effects. So you must be in a really shitty mood.” <EOS>
<BOS> You imagine it’s going to be months before you actually arrive in Jicol, and it’s probably not going to be a comfortable trip either. On the plus side, you’ll be glad to eventually see Vera after this miserable time. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, you two can start anytime now.” Heather says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thanks boss, um we’ve almost taken the city, just trying to make our way to the mayor’s inner sanctum.” <EOS>
<BOS> In the meantime, Annah says she better get back to the university to get the rest of this plan in motion. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t give a shit, you reassign them anyway, if my wife has a problem she can come talk to me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “We lead ourselves,” Richard answers with a smile. <EOS>
<BOS> Marco goes into a physical description of the woman, her demeanor, her clothing, everything. You instantly smile. <EOS>
<BOS> "Elzu, is that your name?" you ask. Torus and Fiala were a god and goddess of the southern Cavendites. "I am Dustan, a storyteller. I will do what I can for you." <EOS>
<BOS> “We have plenty of history books in the main library.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Well maybe their taking their mother's...um disappearance hard." Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 26 <EOS>
<BOS> “Grm. You still pinin’ over yer demon girl?” <EOS>
<BOS> You also had problems with not just a major storm, but a few larger ships that apparently thought it would be fun to open fire on you for the shits and giggles. Doesn't help that the navigator got killed during that exchange and you got severely off course while attempting to outrun the superior ships. <EOS>
<BOS> You now see that your fight with Klint has drawn out a lot of the townsfolk. Bastards were probably watching the entire time. The man who tried to pull you away was the Wilfred the pub owner. It’s a good thing he’s not one of the appointed town watch, but it probably won’t be long. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 20 <EOS>
<BOS> “Talk to the leader and his lieutenants I guess. Martin is his name?” <EOS>
<BOS> Your mother on the other hand didn’t speak so ill of the place, which is surprising since she grew up in a lower class area than your father did. She even said that sometimes she missed the times when she worked at the inn where she met your father in the first place. Of course her knowledge about the city is bound to be a bit out of date. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t think I won’t beat the shit out of you AFTER I’m done beating the shit out of your boyfriend here, you mouthy bitch.” the talkative Talon warns. <EOS>
<BOS> Between the wax, the captain's shouting and some more explosions from the ship as it sinks, you're not hearing the mermaids anymore. It suddenly occurs to you, maybe that's why Rifiv is still doing all this shouting. Now you're glad you helped him. <EOS>
<BOS> "(Sigh) It didn't start out that way. First time I saw her, I thought she was so damn pretty that I just wanted a chance to fuck her before she turned into a Yellow Devil mess, so I didn't give her the real shit. But in time...well I dunno shit happened...and I'm probably an idiot..." Camid says trailing off a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well maybe it’s because you’ve been operating on our turf for quite some time now.” <EOS>
<BOS> Which is good, because you’ve recently heard news that the Ebony Claw Syndicate has recently retaken it’s position back in Holgard by either re-assimilating the “Holgard League” (As your splinter group called itself) or crushing those that opposed the re-assimilation. <EOS>
<BOS> “True, though interesting you’ve picked a royal title though.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, it’s you. I saw a red robe and got a little nervous. What’s with the red robe anyway, aren’t those the ones that Neroth cultists wear?” Bruno asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “A caged bird. A lovely choice!” You say, nodding to encourage her as your mind spins, weaving the threads of a story. A sundial. A winter’s day. A caged bird. “Gather all and hear,” you begin as usual, “the Tale of the Scarlet Nightingale.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright! Alright! I get it, I’m an insensitive asshole, but you REALLY need to stop with these accusations of sister fucking especially when it isn’t even true! Shit, I’m not calling you a whore that sucked Klint’s dick!” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> You then crouch down and stretch your arms out to place Kol in front of you and begin moving back and forth in a jerky motion. Gertrude’s expression would almost be funny if this wasn’t so serious. <EOS>
<BOS> Zal doesn’t really argue, but she does ask what you’re going to do about an assassin though. Just as you’re about to answer, you hear a faint noise, which is enough to put you on edge because it’s been eerily quiet down here. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s finished. This chain is small enough that it should go around the boy’s neck without it falling off in his sleep. However, I’m not a blacksmith so if you’re concerned with it breaking, you might want to get a better one made. Obviously the boy is going to grow, so you’ll obviously have to get a bigger chain eventually anyway. It’s the medallion that’s enchanted though, so no need to worry about losing the magic.” <EOS>
<BOS> Tom wastes no time he immediately opens the door and starts pacing and stretching. <EOS>
<BOS> “I understand the concerns, but we’re already warring with the EC, the last thing we need is to open up a front against a bunch of Neroth worshipers.” Garrick says. <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose that’s true. Still, if we do start seeing shadow monsters, I think we should just get the hell off the island and not look back.” <EOS>
<BOS> With Dr. Gossey’s acceptance of your story she bids you goodbye and immediately goes over to look at her new qweepas. You take your leave with your own still on your shoulder. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s an even longer story and I’ll tell you about that too, but rest assured, what you see on my hands and face is just a fraction of what is practically all over. Doesn’t matter though, I healed and grew stronger. I had far greater losses than any superficial physical appearance.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Not as fine as those elven bitches though. Fuck, one of them had lips that could make a man cry and that one was fucking wild let me tell you.” <EOS>
<BOS> Instead you just sit next to her and hold her. She holds on to you back, finally giving in to her human feelings for you, no matter how buried they were. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, fair, but I’d say I made the best of the situation AND got out of there without getting caught.” <EOS>
<BOS> Since she’s the expert, you decide to have another discussion with Vera about all this before making a final decision, but not right now. You figure after what happened you probably should wait a bit before seeing her again. <EOS>
<BOS> “A dangerous past time indeed.” You say and fortunately Ardan doesn’t realize your sarcasm and instead continues to rant. <EOS>
<BOS> "Do let her know we helped! I'm Lady Kiria," the pink one says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t think it matters boss, this brothel’s fucked, and not in a good way. Just bout every whore in here is dead.” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> For now though you decide to get some sleep after your long night of thievery. As your lids get heavier, you think on where you could ply your trade with a little more ease and a lot more loot. The rich areas are well patrolled, the government district is well patrolled, the merchant district is well patrolled, and the poor areas are…still patrolled and the folks don’t have shit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thanks.” You grumble and begin to unload the carriage. <EOS>
<BOS> "Okay, well say hello to Joachim for me!" You say and you lunge at Wendy with a dagger. <EOS>
<BOS> "Um, no sir. I was in a match three days ago and the other guy got in a few good punches." <EOS>
<BOS> Dr. Gossey’s assessment of you nearly makes you laugh. <EOS>
<BOS> “The ‘King’ and I have our disagreements, though I’d rather see him on the throne than an Imperial puppet. I was part of the King’s Rangers -- well, technically still am, but I’m on somewhat of an extended patrol in these parts.” <EOS>
<BOS> When Annah is like this, she’s just going to keep on, and since she’s obviously managed to fool people into thinking that she’s a registered student here, you’re at a disadvantage if she starts causing trouble. Best to just leave. <EOS>
<BOS> However you manage to do it anyway and are practically running with one hand holding up your pants and the other grabbing Annah’s hand who is keeping up with your pace and going on about how she’s going to do all those things that you had those whores do, but do it way better. <EOS>
<BOS> You shut your door, ignoring Virgil’s cursing and pondering this new information you’ve been given. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh well. I suppose the old Nocturnal headquarters is gone now too?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well then I guess this concludes our business again. I suppose I’ll be sending some of my people to start actively hunting down groups of Guild members based on the information you told me. Next time we see each other though, I trust you’ll have that other vital information for me. Time is growing short you know, and I would hate to see you on the wrong side.” Rook says and pats you hard on the side of your face a couple times before walking away. <EOS>
<BOS> “Indeed. Well we can do this the easy way or the hard way. The choice is yours.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Instead of repreminding you, I have a better solution.” Your eyes begin to widen at your good fortune. They quickly melt once he continues. “You’ll be given extra training hours before sunrise and before you’re allowed to sleep. That should instill the forms within your practice. Now go before I add cleaning hours on top of that.” <EOS>
<BOS> “She didn’t enchant me! In fact she doesn’t even like using her powers like that!” you say getting agitated and temporarily forgetting that you’re at Rook’s mercy. <EOS>
<BOS> “What’s you business here?” one of them asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “However, apologies if I have insulted your friend. My understanding is that you are friends with…Heather is it?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Will you please stop acting so nervous? I doubt if anyone from home is even looking for you anymore and if they are, I hardly think they’re going to go all the way to Klyton. It wasn’t like you killed the blacksmith, it was just Klint.” Annah says. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t say anything else and just focus on getting dressed. As you start to leave, you ask one more question. <EOS>
<BOS> When you look again, that’s when you see her. Tanya. And she’s much different looking now. Even before when she transformed here in this world there was still a human quality about her. <EOS>
<BOS> "But we can't have stories in unscheduled times," the other woman counters, "as it throws off business." <EOS>
<BOS> One last night in Dreaming Forest, then onwards! You will not let her final gift be in vain. <EOS>
<BOS> “And so have I. Look…I’m well aware that it isn’t a safe world out there, but that’s part of what I need to experience. I mean even here, with that overly aggressive asshole Klint hitting on me every other day, I know I’m safe from him because you, mom and dad are around.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well, she’s not getting too far.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, and tell him to make room for ten hobs as well. No way in hell I’m going without at least some back up even if this Peter’s got a whole army behind him.” <EOS>
<BOS> "What a charming, simple snake you are." The peacock fanned his tail and strutted. "Of course I will oblige you - my beauty is my gift to the lesser creatures!" <EOS>
<BOS> And the funniest thing is that Holgard citizens are happy about how oppressive things have gotten. Baroness Ludmilla currently enjoys the most popularity she’s ever had and it’s all thanks mainly because of you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh no. He’s very much legitimate. It’s just that after he had a disagreement with his father and fled the city, all records were pretty much erased of him. He’s basically been living in exile in the Delantium Kingdom. Peter’s disagreement with his father involved the whole breaking away from the Delantium Kingdom in the first place. Peter was the only one who saw it as treason and remained loyal to Delantium. Over the years Peter has been trying to amass an army to take back the city.” <EOS>
<BOS> MAKE HER SUFFER AS WE HAVE SUFFERED <EOS>
<BOS> You duck into the building that Heather and her opponent are fighting on top of and avoid the demon-wizard battle completely. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s interesting how with one well place bundle of explosive power can make an otherwise stable structure fall completely apart. I’ll certainly miss finishing my education.” Madeline says in almost a monotone way. <EOS>
<BOS> “Quick let’s loot the bodies and get outta here. All that noise your shooty gun made might have attracted something else!” Warts exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> When you finally board the Traveller, you’re getting harder stares than you normally are by Zamed’s crew. You also notice a few of them look a little beat up and their clothing is torn. <EOS>
<BOS> Upon entering you see an old defeated looking man in a chair, though not completely broken. Sneaks looks at you without hate, but more with an attitude of “Let’s just get this over with already.” However, you’re not quite done yet. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, but…” <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, well if that was the case they wouldn't have fired me along with everyone else. Look, I don't want to disobey you sir, but I don't want to pretend I'm something I'm not. I mean you'd be even more pissed if you found out I didn't know what the fuck I''m doing." <EOS>
<BOS> You walk with Warts to the front door and bid him goodbye. It’s strange to think that when you met that halfbreed in the woods twenty years ago that he’d wind up as practically your only friend. <EOS>
<BOS> "Have you heard of the Muse Court?" you ask, "The walls are bended trees, planted as saplings long ago and bent and wove into shape as they grew. There are seven thrones of marble, and many pews of wood. But the light - the light there is dappled, the sun coming through the boughs and dancing on the grassy floor, so at noon the Court is always half sun and half shadow, but every patch of it is touched by both." <EOS>
<BOS> At some point you wake up again. This time you couldn’t have been asleep too long since it’s still dark. However that’s not the important part. The important part is the fact that two red eyes are staring at you in the darkness. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t say anything. <EOS>
<BOS> As for you, you’re in the middle of a wood, still wearing your bloody clothes (fortunately you managed to grab some spare in your pack though) unsure of where you’re going to go exactly. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure…sure! I’ve always liked ya son! (hic!) You need Joachim’s blessin?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Where?” <EOS>
<BOS> “If you have ideas, why not bring them to Tom’s attention?” <EOS>
<BOS> Now nearly crippled, you don’t even have the strength to get up again, but it hardly matters since one bandit who was sneaking about and trying to avoid the heavier fighting notices that you’re still breathing. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes. Obviously you’re still going to have to kill Reginald and whatever fanatics he has in the house with him, but the Holgard Watch? They can always change loyalties and those that can’t, well they’ll be dealt with. Consider this another favor from your friends at the Ebony Claw.” <EOS>
<BOS> Though you hope you aren’t too rusty at it, you haven’t been doing as much shooting as you once did. (And as much as it might be more convenient at times, openly killing Holgard Watchmen on a whim is likely to get you hunted down a lot quicker) Still, you do try to keep in practice in the sewers where nobody gives a shit if you’re firing off a weapon you’re not supposed to own anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> You turn around. <EOS>
<BOS> "What kind of logic is that? If I surrender, I'm going to face the consequences too. Vaughn, open up the trap door, I'm going to get as much as I can from the safe." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well the fact that you’re so concerned about me, is a pretty good indication that you’re no heartless monster and you’re talking about something that MIGHT happen, not that it will. Besides, despite all of what we’ve shared you still don’t know everything about me either.” <EOS>
<BOS> Being the paranoid sort she is, she’s perfectly fine with you going there personally to check things out. Of course as you predicted, you still have to stick around a bit to take care of some of your current business. <EOS>
<BOS> “I was following you because I wanted to talk to you since I’m well aware that you’ve still been thieving at the university. Though I appreciate that you were staying out of my way.” <EOS>
<BOS> Given his superior attitude and boasting, you can only imagine this is Reginald. He gives you a look that reminds you of that fat perverted merchant you had to kill years ago. You instinctively cover yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re really going to hate this new arrangement. You send a message off to Vera explaining the situation. <EOS>
<BOS> “So…wait…you REALLY think I’m going to wear this? Surely even someone of your intelligence can see that I’m not some dainty aristocrat who dresses in fancy gowns and adores myself with jewelry.” <EOS>
<BOS> “But I was just…” you start to say before you’re interrupted again. <EOS>
<BOS> Your question catches Rook and Lloyd off guard. Bolt just remains stoic. <EOS>
<BOS> It is a weapon designed for one thing only: the destruction of the muses. <EOS>
<BOS> You keep up your usual caution and after about a week, nobody is trying to tell you that some guy is looking for you anymore. You end up wondering if it was some message from your family after all. <EOS>
<BOS> Doesn't take long before there is chaos on the ship and you're also fighting off your fellow enchanted crew mates. Well "fellow" might be too strong of a word since you didn't even like most of them. <EOS>
<BOS> One of the soldiers grabs you while another begins grabbing your belongings such as your weapons and your pack. They toss everything out, but when they see the crown, all of their eyes narrow and you know enough that you’re in even deeper shit. <EOS>
<BOS> "But it's already crowded," one pouts. "Unless you want to join us, Balen, I'm sure we could make some room." <EOS>
<BOS> Since Heather doesn’t seem to be very helpful right now, you go back to wondering if you should seek help from other magic types which again makes you consider sending someone to ask around Klyton or the magic University in Delantium. <EOS>
<BOS> Out of curiosity you pay a visit to the section to where the medical school is located. Seems weird that your father spent so much money and time putting himself through the place while you’re here basically casing it. <EOS>
<BOS> Look, I need to do this on my own. I need to fail or succeed on my own. I need to take care of myself, I mean don’t you think I’ve got the skills to do it?” <EOS>
<BOS> “You didn’t need to. Magic has a habit of making you old before your time. That’s why whenever you someone talks about wizards; the stereotype is some decrepit old person. It’s not that far off, except the old person usually isn’t all that old in years at least. But such is the price we pay for being skilled in the gift that Dorna bestowed upon this world.” <EOS>
<BOS> Spryce returns after a few minutes, and the mage leaves with his latest glowing box. <EOS>
<BOS> Staying with the Crimson Talons, just seems like a bunch of trouble waiting to happen. They’re disorganized, their new leader is some guy that YOU had to rescue, they’re obviously on the hit list of the authorities here and you aren’t getting the impression that they’re going to be your style. <EOS>
<BOS> “Speaking of questions, how did you even know I was here?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I guess? Little bit out of my area of expertise. So wait, you aren’t planning on making Dorna the only goddess to worship in the city?” <EOS>
<BOS> So far, you've managed to avoid that fate, but the caravan will take at least another week. <EOS>
<BOS> Rook now really doesn’t believe anything you have to say, so the only chance you hope to have is to hold out until Tanya gets here. Unfortunately Rook is so mad, that he’s intent on killing you now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hope Yag’s rolling in yer favor.” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> Garrick says nothing; he just staggers back a bit against a table like all the wind has been knocked out of him. Tanya now turns her attention towards you. <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t sure if it’s the drink that’s breaking down your willpower or Vera’s fairly convincing argument, but you can’t hold back anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> Lorthander motions to the prisoners in the cages. “All of them.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Money’s no object.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, why ya think I wanted someone else to come along?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’d watch your choice of words if you want the greenskins to remain less savage.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> "Alright, before you go on a fuck tirade, I'll try to explain it so simple that you'll understand." <EOS>
<BOS> “What the hell are you on about?” <EOS>
<BOS> Seth drops the two wooden swords on the floor, not bothering to place them back on the wall. He exits the training grounds. You’re left alone to decide your course of action. <EOS>
<BOS> You return to the oily man. "You mentioned I could work for free passage? What sort of work?" <EOS>
<BOS> “What do you want to see Rook for?” <EOS>
<BOS> Before you can even answer, Rook smashes his fist into your face and begins kicking you on the floor. He also starts ranting at you about disrespecting the name of Fel. Saying that an unbeliever such as yourself attempting to invoke the name in order to gain some sort of leverage because of his own faith is offensive to him. <EOS>
<BOS> "As you say!" you smile, inwardly working the tale. The serpent is a symbol of trickery, but was once common in fables as a creature exposing the folly of others. "People of the Oasis, I give you the tale of the Shrewd Serpent!" <EOS>
<BOS> You rise from your kneeling position and slide your sword from your scabbard. It’s familiar hilt fits in the palm of your hand better than any glove could. It’s an extension of your own physical body. You feel its weight and guide it through the air with ease as if your own arm. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright, alright, shit…robe…robe…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, are you asking the Nocturnal League for a loan?” <EOS>
<BOS> Heather, yourself and her group take this moment to rest up and talk a bit of strategy. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, we can’t do nothing and if you aren’t fond of diplomacy, then we need to kill Jake. So who are these independent assassins you know?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately that’s when the leader shows up. He’s not riding a horse either, but a chariot pulled by what looks like giant armored boars. Several of his people rally in front of him and they all make a beeline charge towards the soldiers, while others ride around to flank the sides. <EOS>
<BOS> The other bandit at this point has turned around and raised his arms though still holding on to his weapon. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, that old man didn’t know what hit him.” Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Indeed, so I believe some of the burden should go to someone that obviously has more flexibility and hands on skill in spying and lurking about and I have to believe someone like you has experience in shadowy works and underhanded ways of gathering vital information when necessary.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I need to contact a man by the name of Rook, I have important business with him. Specifically information.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well let’s not do that either.” <EOS>
<BOS> And with that, you and Mr. Scars do no more talking for the rest of the night, though Mr. Scars was done talking and ready to sleep anyway. You on the other hand have a hard time getting to sleep, knowing what awaits you. <EOS>
<BOS> Garrick’s sudden snap causes you to shut up immediately and everyone else to stand in silence. You certainly weren’t expecting it, but then Garrick in general has been less than friendly with you, as your time in the Guild proper has come about. He’s certainly nowhere near like he was when he first offered his hand to you in joining. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I suppose you will…apologies.” Your sister says. <EOS>
<BOS> Afterwards you spend some of the day seeking out new burglary opportunities, though since you’re a lot lower on coin due to spending some of it on Randi earlier, you engage in a little more pick pocketing. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera’s suggestion solves a few issues you suppose. <EOS>
<BOS> “I am sure he resisted the shade,” Brother Samuel says. <EOS>
<BOS> “I mean they still do…it’s just um…well things are a bit different now…look you’re gonna wanna make good connections in this line of work and right now I’m giving you a perfect opportunity to make some fucking great ones at no cost! You come with me, meet a few people and if you feel like we’re not your style, well I promise you can just walk away. You really don’t have anything to lose.” <EOS>
<BOS> The smallest item, but the most dazzling, is an 18k gold brooch in the shape of a horse, with a ruby set for the eye. It's even displayed in a lovely, small case. The proprietor claims it is new, having been sold to the shop by a man left at the altar. It might cost 400 silver in a jewelry shop, but here it is marked at 65. <EOS>
<BOS> “Or maybe I’m succeeding in something you never had the guts to do at all? That’s it isn’t it? You’ve never made any sort of advance on her, and just admired her from afar since you were always secure in the fact that she always drove everyone away. I’m guessing perhaps you thought one day Tanya would come to you of her own accord and…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Great. So you’re just wasting money for no gain whatsoever.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I gave you MORE than enough Warts. I still have find someone interested in this shit as you put it.” Yinen remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “This one is not among them.” <EOS>
<BOS> “RAPE! RAPE! RAPE!” <EOS>
<BOS> “DON’T MOVE!” one shouts as several spears are pointed directly at you. <EOS>
<BOS> With you and Reginald on the floor, the congregation is now really getting agitated. Those two large cultists that dragged you from the cell immediately go to get you off of Reginald, but before they can, you hear grunts and howls of pain as Tanya has stabbed them both. <EOS>
<BOS> However, you have another problem that doesn’t seem to be getting solved another way anytime soon and as grim as the current solution is, this is probably about the only time you’re going to feel someone is deserving of it. <EOS>
<BOS> After three days of this, no closet to finding the base but having destroyed a hundred acres of forest, the commander had them split up and fan out, scouting deep into the forest for clues. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe you can work this in your favor after all. <EOS>
<BOS> Your silence confirms her accusations. <EOS>
<BOS> “And get this man’s weapons back while you’re at it.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I dunno, just get it. Go raid a wood mill. Pay for it. Rip out support beams from abandon buildings. Seduce a lumber jack. Cut down fucking trees yourself and drag them back here. I don't give a shit HOW you do it, just fucking do it! You said you were on board with this, well start fucking contributing." You order. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well I got other shit to do. Not only do I have the thankless AND hopeless task of training what pathetic remnants of what passes for wizards nowadays, but I also have a lot of tasks from the baroness who wants protection spells all over the walls of this fucking city.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Shit." The officer says as the axe only goes half way through your neck, which kills you though in order to take your head completely off the officer just stomps hard on the back of your head while sawing through your neck with the axe. <EOS>
<BOS> It was found by a creature no one expected, one not chosen by the gods. And here is the hero of our tale! What animal would solve the map and find the treasure?" <EOS>
<BOS> "...pick axes, lanterns, shovels, ropes, lumber? How the hell are we supposed to steal a shitload of heavy ass lumber?" <EOS>
<BOS> One thing you are noticing is nobody seems to be siding with you. This is worse than you thought. You already have your hand on your weapon. <EOS>
<BOS> "Sorry," you say, "but I couldn't sleep with the screams. Who was he?" <EOS>
<BOS> What if you go back and there is nothing to go back to? Or more specifically what if you made changes here to the point that you don’t exist? <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, I’m good with what I got right now. Anyway, I’m here to see you since you’re the closest person I know to a wizard on this island.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Youz gonna fall out and break yo’ neck too. All youz gotta do is cover yerself in dirt and leaves and shit. Hides youz just fine.” Warts says and begins doing just that. <EOS>
<BOS> Walking through the jungle nowadays is a lot safer nowadays, though that probably can’t be said for Jicol. Ever since the city got half flooded, it’s been having criminal activity problems, though not really coming from your end of things, since you’ve practically got your own small town now (Still trying to think of an official name for it). <EOS>
<BOS> You head back to your room and you can’t get your mind off of her. You’d visit a brothel, but that didn’t work out so well last time. So you take the matter in hand… <EOS>
<BOS> Predictably Annah does indeed cuddle up next to you during the night. While she sleeps fairly sound, you remain in a half sleep state and waking up periodically. <EOS>
<BOS> "SHIT!" You shout as your wounded leg gives way due to lack of strength and a slimy stone floor. Falling on your face, you already know you aren't getting away at this rate. <EOS>
<BOS> After a bit of going back and forth of explaining that disarming traps is part of their training, you ultimately give them a break by stepping in and helping out directly. <EOS>
<BOS> “Now, the only rules are, you don’t tamper with it and you definitely don’t give it to anyone else except Crasnov. If you accomplish that, you will be rewarded with more money and I guarantee you will have the thanks of some powerful friends. Friends that may call upon you for other lucrative opportunities.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, common sense. You really need it to survive in this world.” You say and take your last drink before leaving for the Barnacle. <EOS>
<BOS> Once upon a time in a city called Klyton, there was a young man who wanted to be a doctor. He studied hard in school and his parents supported his dreams for he was intelligent and hard working and they knew he could succeed if given the chance. They also wanted him to have a more stable and comfortable life than they did. (Much like their parents before them) <EOS>
<BOS> "An egg would work fine." <EOS>
<BOS> “Wut? No! Dis one ain’t fightin’, well at least not for another few years anyway. Dis iz my son.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course not! I don’t even talk much with the other slaves! I swear to Ahmed as I do not want my situation to become even worse.” Layla remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “No! I’m going to say some shit that YOU need to hear! I know all about your ex-girlfriend. Warts mentioned that you were really head over heels for a demonkin once when he suggested that I was banging my head up against a wall with you. Said that’s probably the real reason why you don’t have any relationships at all because you’re still in love with the infernal bitch.” <EOS>
<BOS> You manage to get to your room and you’ve got your dick in her before you even get to the bed. In any case, once again Annah isn’t fucking around (so to speak) and proves just what you’ve been missing all these years. <EOS>
<BOS> Part of you is only just now starting to feel the various negative emotions involving your parents and Annah. You can only imagine the shitstorm they’re facing because of your actions. You just hope that they don’t suffer the consequences of what you did. <EOS>
<BOS> You suddenly stop walking and it occurs to you that he isn't just calling you "boss" as some term of deference of social status. <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well,” Ragar the Unbroken utters. “Ask your accursed questions and release me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t!” you exclaim which causes the guards to look over at you and then you get quiet again until they look away. <EOS>
<BOS> "...Mmm hmm...but why didn't you just buy your old family inn? I believe it's still abandoned and for sale surprisingly enough." <EOS>
<BOS> With those words Percy gets up, wincing in a bit of pain as he does. <EOS>
<BOS> “I was. And it’s all true, they were a bunch of unsubtle idiots. Wasn’t always like that of course when we were the Crimson Talons, but well shit happens. Perhaps that’s how I managed to stay undetected since I was probably one of the few that was still a professional. Kind of like you in that way right?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Will you stop waving that thing around?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> Marco and the people with him nod and stand back as Zamed and two other scruffy looking men stand before you. All three of them look annoyed that you’ve taken them away from whatever else they were doing. <EOS>
<BOS> You spend a lot of time in your room basically pacing the floor, wondering if you’ve made the right decision, but you try not to think about it too much since it’s done now and you’ll hopefully have new allies that will at least watch your back. <EOS>
<BOS> ‘We find that it’s always better to deal with a single reliable source rather than all these unwashed disorganized types. We would of course bring our own ship here for pick up. Also we’ve notice that the drug of choice here on this island is either Green Lotus or that very poor substitute of Blue Dream, Purple Wish. As part of our new arrangement we could provide Blue Dream for you to distribute here. Makes a lot of money, we should know after all.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay Heather, I’m going to risk this, but as a show of good will I’m going to need something from you too.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Tempting, but you might as well stick with it out a little while longer. Oddly part of you doesn’t want to dishonor the agreement with Dr. Gossey even if her assistant is a bitch. <EOS>
<BOS> It would appear you have more people on your side than you thought <EOS>
<BOS> You look over at Vaughn. You've never known him to be that insightful, but he's hitting all the points right now. <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno, but I’m guessing if Fel really didn’t like it, he would have already killed all of us with shadow monsters by now.” <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, you decide that the university district might be the place to start plying your trade since the militia patrols are infrequent and the Bloody Talon assholes aren’t around here. <EOS>
<BOS> As you get closer to the hub, more of the slavers appear to defend their territory. A few of them are armed with crossbows and their own firearms, so you take a nearby customer and use him as a meat shield. He screams the entire time until he finally takes a shot to his head, splattering part of his brains on you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well guess I better hear it then.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh shortly after we separated I wandered and talked to a few people and even looked around seeing if I could steal anything, but there really wasn’t a good opportunity, and then something weird happened.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Most of the time when Scales got a little obstinate Edmond showed him the broken egg that he hatched from. Not sure why it worked. Maybe it was a reminder that Edmond was the one who helped hatch him or something. Still have the broken egg just in case, you know? Maybe if someone approached him with the broken egg, Scales might be willing to listen to that person. Dunno, who would have the balls to go risk it though.” <EOS>
<BOS> There are about five boats that look like they are taking passengers, so you spend some time looking over their information and fees. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'll be returning to my cabin." A third man says, and you finally notice the stern man in brown standing in the corner of the room. He holds a box that glows, slightly, and radiates cold. The man wears the green crest of a Journeyman Mage on his arm. "You'll be paid the rest at landfall," he tells them and brushes past you. The other two step aside to let him pass. <EOS>
<BOS> "Good, good. Of course, I'll have to get one of the mages to put a geas on you. I can't have you blabbing about us, even unintentionally." <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually Vaughn and Zalmora pull Jake off of you who is laughing. <EOS>
<BOS> - The merchants camel caravan is fine, if you are a merchant, but can be rough for travelers going with them. And they charge for everything - not just the camel or a fee for protection, but for any blankets, water, or shelter you might use along the way. Those who run out of cash might get assigned as assistants or maids to the merchants until the journey is over - and there are rumors of some never making it to their destination at all. Mandi is a decent sized desert town, however, and storytelling is allowed there - even welcomed enthusiastically. <EOS>
<BOS> Garrick just starts shaking his head. <EOS>
<BOS> You look at Vera and it’s very apparent she’s hoping that you’ll believe this partial truth and let it go. You won’t though, and she probably knows that too. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, hope yer as sneaky as you claim, cuz all bets are off if the bandits catch sight of ya. Dis way.” <EOS>
<BOS> As silly as it is for you to be singing loudly in the middle of the fucking ocean about a priest's daughter losing her anal virginity, it's keeping you alive. This must go on for at least an hour or so. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re pondering this decision, a voice calls out to you. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re smart enough not to start a fight with an armored guard, but you’re starting to wonder if you’re going to even get in the city. <EOS>
<BOS> "I can't," he says, "I must go with them." <EOS>
<BOS> "We can go anywhere in the world." <EOS>
<BOS> “I was heading that way, but I’ve never been there.” <EOS>
<BOS> Her main concern is possible magic protection which seems like a given and partially asked for your help since she knows your area is the university which also houses the college of magic and was wondering if perhaps you had any access to or perhaps even acquired anything that might bypass such things. <EOS>
<BOS> You haven't been here five minutes, and he's already playing mind games... <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe YOU could form a new organization. If you did, you’d certainly bring in more money and strengthen the underworld here again. Maybe you could even influence the government like the Ebony Claw Syndicate and the Guild once did. <EOS>
<BOS> “Go ahead.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Annah, if you wanted one of those necklaces so bad, you could have just stolen it yourself. You were closer to the merchant and easily had him distracted.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Heh, well why not queen then?” <EOS>
<BOS> “First thing you’ve said, that I agree with.” Tanya remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t going to let this fat fuck get a chance to possibly shoot you in the back, plus you’re too pissed about him trying to molest you. <EOS>
<BOS> You then pack a few things and give notice to the baroness that you’re leaving for Klyton making something up about rumors that her brother Peter is potentially working with the Klyton government in order to form his next invasion. <EOS>
<BOS> "Apparently that's sort of a newer development. The old lady has gotten a bit religious over the past few years. Probably brought on by failing health." <EOS>
<BOS> While perhaps it is just very bad luck and coincidence that all these ladies that you were intimate with, met tragic deaths, but you feel very certain that this has something to do with being bonded with Tanya. It’s your curse as it were. <EOS>
<BOS> In the aftermath, Ragar the Unbroken is nowhere to be seen. <EOS>
<BOS> As Madeline and you embrace, you think about how your actions lead you to this fate. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, that’s what they get for being so high profile and generally being a bunch of unsubtle idiots. Wait, were you in the Talons?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose its even more tiring when you’re on the losing side.” <EOS>
<BOS> “The Talons are far from being my pals. I don’t even do business with those crazy fuckers anymore. Haven’t ever since they pulled that shit last year where killed a bunch of the militia. Associating with psycho assholes on any level like that is a sure way of getting targeted.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re not listening kid, I’m telling you to get…” <EOS>
<BOS> “I said shut up! I thought about this. I thought about the pros and cons for a long time. The right and wrong. And ultimately it all comes back to justice.” The man says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, Annah you got my attention, but if we’re gonna do this, we need more privacy.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “What’re you talking about?” <EOS>
<BOS> Despite being on the road for a few days, you don’t know when you’ve actually crossed into Delantium territory until you see a sign post along side the road that states that fact. Not far from the signpost is a building, probably a roadside inn of some sort. <EOS>
<BOS> Next, he approached the lion. "Oh, king of beasts, I have heard you are a mighty hunter! I hunt myself, simple creature that I am, but all I catch are mice and rabbits." <EOS>
<BOS> "Don't think Captain Brost will have use for stories, but I'll mention it." The man rolls his shoulders. "We'll be departing in a few minutes." <EOS>
<BOS> "You think I was born yesterday? You may be the son of Eliza, but you sure ain't anything like her OR your father. They were decent people. While YOU are a lying criminal scumbag just like my worthless children. It seems a little too fucking convenient that you show up on my doorstep the day after I find out what's going on at my tavern. I'm not really surprised by my son Carl. He's a miserable gambler with a weakness for whores. Annie, however I thought at least had a little more sense. Guess you're really putting it good on her if she's gone along with this shit." <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, okay. Yeah sure, what caused you to change your mind?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Honestly, it’s not really that far fetched given what I’ve always heard about the old Baron. Though I’m just surprised you’ve never mentioned it before. Seems like something you’d brag about.” <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile one of the requests to Heather is asking if she can figure out a way to lift your curse. She says she doesn’t know other than the ritual Elder Flynn suggested that time and apparently he never did give the exact details about what it all entailed as far as the words to say and such. (And she’s not exactly keen on bringing up the other known detail you both know about) <EOS>
<BOS> Tom announces the changes and like with any change, everyone has an opinion. Mostly for the better thankfully. Jake complains the loudest, but when it’s pointed out that it doesn’t matter if he kills people as much, he grumbles slightly less. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, sure I guess. Goodbye.” <EOS>
<BOS> You eventually see Scully again who says the Captain wants to meet you. So you head back above deck where you meet the captain who doesn't look like you thought. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, guess so. I should be gettin’ back fore Gubbins an’ Zuggins run my tradin’ post inta da ground. Plus Snuffit’s wit child again so can’t be away too long anywayz.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright, alright, you win. I’ll go. You won’t see me anymore. Didn’t mean to intrude and I’m glad you’re doing well for yourself and not laying dead somewhere. I really mean that.” You say and back off. <EOS>
<BOS> The next morning as soon as you make your way down stairs to go see Yinen, you’re approached by two figures. <EOS>
<BOS> “What are you exactly?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> We don’t have the luxury of time. Our leader needs you, all of you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shh, quiet.” The witch says. <EOS>
<BOS> No sooner have you picked it up and that’s when you feel an unnatural chill in the air. <EOS>
<BOS> "I've never seen storytime so packed, before," the man offers. "And just look at them, our tables are near full. Perhaps we could use this? Draw in the crowds with a dedicated storytime, say nine each morning, ending at ten. The crowd would then have a couple hours to fill until lunch, and how better than to pass it reading?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Guess so. <EOS>
<BOS> “No! I do. I’m just surprised.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Careful with those, you get caught with them and it’s the death penalty rather than just a fine and jail time. Sort of surprised those objects weren’t destroyed when your parents were…killed.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Warts? What’re you doing here?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that’s still fucking old then, aren’t you like seventy?” <EOS>
<BOS> “SHHHHHH! Hear dat?” Warts says and stops to listen. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah, I suppose that’s true.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well, but I’m not sticking around and I suggest you and your…love leave as soon as possible, because I doubt the Holgard Watch is going to be as understanding when they arrive.” Gwen replies and quickly runs over to the burning barricade and casts a spell to put it out before proceeding out the destroyed door opening. <EOS>
<BOS> You turn to run out the other side of the room, but you then see two more statues blocking that way as well. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, we’re a lot more than just a gang.” <EOS>
<BOS> “But…it can’t end like this! Not now! Not when I…(sob)” <EOS>
<BOS> "That's quite a ways, quite a ways. None of my beauties will get you there, of course, they can't swim that far!" He tries whistling and laughing at the same time, which comes out something like the sound a mad hyena might make. "But I can get you to the shore of Syphyr." He rummages around his cluttered desk and comes up with a map, dirty and creased enough to be at least a decade old, which he spreads before you. "Here are a couple routes you could take: <EOS>
<BOS> This is the end you know it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Please…no…” <EOS>
<BOS> You lead the way, completely surprising several thieves when you arrive. <EOS>
<BOS> The floors are sticky with filth and the walls in this dim light don't seem much better. A family of rats scurry past you as you walk further in making you wonder if you've left the sewers at all. <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm serious! She actually said that to me!" <EOS>
<BOS> “Afraid so boss. Camid was found dead with several large holes in him. Legs, back, chest, head, arms, everywhere.” Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> The shade doesn’t react. Then Samuel begins to hear a slow, resonating laugh. The laughter isn’t audible, it feels as if it originates and echoes within Samuel’s head. In a swirl of black mist, the shade vanishes into the night. The mocking laugh begins to slowly subside within Samuel’s head. Samuel scoops his arms under the unconscious boy and lifts him from the ground. <EOS>
<BOS> As you do so, Peter is already studying you. Delantium soldiers sitting nearby also stare at you. <EOS>
<BOS> You suppose you could just fire blindly and hope you get them or maybe try to retreat out the exit where there is more light. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s okay, don’t need to hear the details. Anyway, guess it’ll have to do.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I know," you hear a voice in your mind. "Your journey has been like watching a distant dream." <EOS>
<BOS> “So you were successful then. Mind telling me what you have?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Shut up. Now I trust twenty thousand gold is enough for you and enough to throw at your crew and the crews of these dead captains to ensure their loyalty under your new command of two more ships now?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> And then you find that your savings are still there. Even the blade trap you have set hasn’t been disturbed. You then breathe sigh a relief as you put everything back. <EOS>
<BOS> You have little time and it isn’t much, but you try to reassure her that it isn’t either of their faults. You’d like to calm her down some more, but there are a bunch of people soon banging at the door. <EOS>
<BOS> You are thrown to the ground again and then Scales pounces on top of you. You can only see his eyes in this darkness, but it’s the last thing you’re ever going to see. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, I know I don’t, however I know its in your territory so to speak, I don’t really want to cause any potential problems.” <EOS>
<BOS> “And just think, you will now have MORE resources at your disposal and no longer need to worry about the law…not that you did before, but that specter still loomed over you even if it was a friendly one.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you arrive, you find several dead bodies and people running about in panic. Some of your men ask you for further instructions, but you’re not even paying attention, you’re just looking at the temple, which is half in ruins. You don’t see Vera or Kol and you’re sure they would be out of the temple by now. <EOS>
<BOS> You never thought you’d feel this way, but you’ve actually considered joining them lately mainly because things have been just so miserable in the Guild. If it weren’t for Tanya, you probably would have done it already. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, you lot want to be pirates. Alright, do you own a ship?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Easy there! We’re just having a conversation, not an interrogation! I apologize for my friend; sometimes our line of work keeps one on edge. It’s okay if you don’t want to tell us where you’re from, a man has a right to his secrets.” Flynt says in a cordial tone. <EOS>
<BOS> “As far as I know I don’t have that ability and I doubt healing magic is something that most infernals have anyway given their destructive nature.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I have a deal with her.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, and we’re not talking about it. In any case, I’m here to help you in your plan, because I believe you’re completely right about this. These cultists need to be destroyed and taking their leader out will at least severely lessen their power.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What the hell are you doing?!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> "Wouldn't it be a little obvious, if the Talons set up there again?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Seth strides quickly through the castle hallways. You follow at the same pace a distance behind him. You know he prefers to walk in silence, so there’s no point in running to catch up to him. He leads you down a familiar path; you arrive at the castle training grounds. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, your succubus ex, wouldn’t just be summoned forth into this world, she’d be brought forth into the body of the girl you’d be having sex with.” <EOS>
<BOS> "What? Are you serious?" Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> “What you got crotch rot?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> He's having a hard time getting up, and you see yet another charmed crewman walking over to finish him off. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s it? There’s nothing else involved is there? I mean you’re not going to ask for sexual favors are you?” <EOS>
<BOS> You hold up your hands and bow your head. <EOS>
<BOS> For all her change, you know that Tanya’s probably still considering your last statement to her. Which means she probably isn’t going to attack Rook immediately giving you a bit of time to form a plan. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well how’s this lizard going to be of any help then?” <EOS>
<BOS> After five minutes Kol and Layla are both in tears from your demanding questioning, however you have learned a few things. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because we’re not a damn threat? We’ve never been a threat.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You cannot command me to lift a curse that I never placed on you mortal. The only curse you have is your love of me and I can’t help you with that. I wish I could, but you didn’t listen to me when I told you not to pursue me in the first place and this is where we are now.” Tanya says with a bit of sympathy in her voice. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good to hear. I have you booked at the Galloping Mare Inn. It’s one of the better places in this city.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It ends today and the faith of Fel will rule supreme in the city at last!” Gloom shouts and throws down the orb. A bit more dramatic than you’d expect from a Felian, but then Gloom’s whole attack tonight is a bit more theatrical than a typical Felian would go about this. Good thing too, since if he behaved more like his predecessors he wouldn’t be going in so recklessly like this. <EOS>
<BOS> “She’s not human m’boy. Well…not entirely human anyway. She’s a bit of a late bloomer though with her powers, but I love her all the same. Let me ask you something though, has she been appearing in your dreams recently?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I see. Well guess all that’s left now is for us is the year to prepare, what do you need me to do?” <EOS>
<BOS> “No. The Empire is mine.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, because your son was telling me before you came in that this Fel was speaking with him and…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Who’s the strange woman?” you ask the wizard, as you descend a flight of stairs well away from the audience chamber. <EOS>
<BOS> As much as you might feel the urge to do so, you resist starting a fistfight. With a guy like Jake, it’s likely to turn into something a little more fatal and this isn’t like the situation with Klint. Jake isn’t just some loudmouth bully with a chip on his shoulder. He’s a real violent criminal and has loads more skill than you in a street fight. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright! Alright! Shit! I know how to keep quiet you crazy fuck!” Trobart exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> “Uh, yeah. The timing is about right. It was odd too since my wife didn’t think she was fertile.” <EOS>
<BOS> A bolt whizzing by suddenly interrupts Tanya’s words. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, what? You mean someone was already coming to get you?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck it. I mean at one time I would have killed you as a hypocritical traitor, but what difference does it make now? I already killed the head of the Guild. I’m hardly in a position to judge. If anything, I think I feel better about all this.” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Scully mentioned something about a lot of the crew getting killed, what happened exactly?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Most of them don’t seem to realize that this city is too damn secure to just go on the way they’ve been going on. A lot more subtlety and a lot less smash and grab is in order. <EOS>
<BOS> "I think so. Probably wouldn't have to pay him much more than we do to fight, but we’d definitely have to dry him out a bit though." Vaughn says. <EOS>
<BOS> "So wait, if this place is going legit, does that mean we can't fuck the merchants that come in here anymore?" A whore asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “It isn’t in Klyton, but we could always start doing it outside of Klyton. Robbing caravans and such on the roads. It isn’t like Jake is going to care where he does it and those two half elf whores will probably be ecstatic about working outside the city. Also, the militia isn’t going to be as fanatical about tracking down shit that goes on outside the city.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh no. I just told her that her mother died in childbirth. Her mother is really a full-blooded succubus. They aren’t known to be maternal until their daughters have already grown up and shown that they’re worthy of their attention. Displayed powers and such. They never much bother with their male children at all though. I should know.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I can’t believe it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I told you, I’m not getting married, I need you to marry two other people. Now enough with the questions and let’s go!” <EOS>
<BOS> After leaving immediate danger, you start to wonder if joining the EC is the way to go after all since it seems like everyone in it hates you. On one hand you can’t be too surprised, but on the other now it seems like a less favorable choice. Instead of having the boss angry at you, you’ll have the rest of the damn organization angry at you. You can’t fucking win, maybe you need to just get the hell out of the city altogether. That would certainly solve a lot of problems. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ludmilla seems to enjoy rulership of this city.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wazzat? Weddin’?” <EOS>
<BOS> You continue to stand there and say nothing, which only causes Garrick to throw something at you, which you narrowly dodge. <EOS>
<BOS> "It is a special fragrance designed to be worn around horses without upsetting them. Cypriol and cypress oils, hand-pressed, create a woody base grounded by patchouli and amber. The center is a core of horse sweat, petitgrain, grapefruit, and crisp apple, and the top notes are cactus flower and narcissus." <EOS>
<BOS> “The Jicol’s government is fairly hands off at times. Considering they let pirates dock in the city as long as they aren’t pillaging or causing trouble, they probably aren’t going to care about what we’re doing out here. I mean that’s why we’re setting up a base out here right? In fact, I’d say they’d probably prefer it if those type came over here instead. In time we could probably build up a small trading outpost and move some of our businesses out of Jicol entirely.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, for centuries,” the Grandmaster replies. <EOS>
<BOS> You stagger around a bit before getting your bearings. In this darkness several burning fires provide most of the nearby illumination. It’s nothing but destruction everywhere. <EOS>
<BOS> “You want food? You want fucking food? HERE! Take it! Take everything I fucking have!” you shout as you pull out apples from your bag and start throwing them at her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, looks like the Teckleville Terror is finally up and from here on your ass belongs to me until your execution.” A familiar voice remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “The fuck…shit…” you say and slide out of Annah and fall backwards on the floor narrowly missing Checkers who barks at you, being annoyed that your nearly fell on her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Our matter?” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re dead.” He says. <EOS>
<BOS> Vaughn’s temper at this point starts to rise at Camid’s remark and now those two are nearly coming to blows. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm. Yes, it is strange. I thought he’d at least show up threatening you or something similar. He was very jealous and possessive.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ew! Fucking perv! You think you’re funny? You won’t be so funny after I set your balls on fire.” The young woman says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I’m fine. Probably won’t need to worry about the law this time either. Well hopefully anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> In any case you and Vera continue your sexual activities and even though you’re the weakly choking her a bit, you’re the one that starts feeling delirious and out of breath. <EOS>
<BOS> Once again you return to your usual routine. <EOS>
<BOS> "Of course not, sir," you swallow. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, I’m not saying it isn’t a nice idea, but I’m still not seeing why we should be following you. I mean I know you’ve got a bit of a reputation as a skilled killer and I’m certainly not going to fuck with you, but there’s a difference between being a killer and a leader. I haven’t seen any evidence that you’re a leader.” One of them says. <EOS>
<BOS> Richard swings open the door to his hut. More green light pours from within. It’s a simple place, filled with solid wooden furniture. In the corner, a man lies in bed, a woman sponging his forehead. She turns at your arrival, surprised only for a brief moment at your presence. Her eyes glisten in the green light, sparkling against the bright blue as if gentle waves. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, yeah, here’s the rent.” You say handing over a few silvers to Trobart. <EOS>
<BOS> “Like what?” <EOS>
<BOS> You naturally ignore her and start following her anyway. You must hop across three rooftops before Tanya stops again. <EOS>
<BOS> Keira briefly looks over at it and her eyes widen as if this encouragement is the first she’s heard in awhile from anyone. You take a deep breath and approach her closer. <EOS>
<BOS> “I thought of that too,” Seth answers. <EOS>
<BOS> “So, we’re going to Jasmine’s shop.” <EOS>
<BOS> “….Oh YEAH! Yeah! I remember him! Hey he was lookin’ fer you…yesterday…said he wants you to…” Virgil starts to say before you interrupt. <EOS>
<BOS> You doubt if you’re going to go meet Keira and if Ardan’s going to kill you, you’re not going to make it easy for him by going where it’s isolated. <EOS>
<BOS> “No.” Percy says finishing off his drink. <EOS>
<BOS> “I think they were always going to win. They just have the numbers and now you’re suggesting just the two of us going against them?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Someone who actually helped me out, Jake.” Tom says shaking his head at all this new information and just tells you to come with him while he checks his room. <EOS>
<BOS> “Call me an optimist.” <EOS>
<BOS> You look around the museum and mostly see a lot of oversized items that you’d need at least two people to carry to get out of here. Statues, suits of rusty armor, oversized tapestries and the like. While you’re sure some of this stuff is valuable to someone, it wouldn’t exactly be the easiest to just lift out of here. Though you haven’t seen or heard any night guards of any kind at all. Seems weird that this place doesn’t have any security. <EOS>
<BOS> “And it looks like that worked out real well for you.” <EOS>
<BOS> Of course that little theory soon comes to an end when you at last do hit the ground. Who knows where the hell you ended up, because you broke every bone and died on impact, but your splattered body didn’t go to waste to whatever was living so far below the ground. <EOS>
<BOS> You leave the Crimson Talon headquarters and enter the sewers. You never cease hating stomping around down here, but possibly stepping in shit or worse is the least of your concerns right now. <EOS>
<BOS> These people are already trying to kill you in broad daylight in front of people, all bets are fucking off. <EOS>
<BOS> You realize, this is one of the waitresses at your father's old inn! You remember your mother mentioning working with her in some of her old stories to you and your sister, but then you never did pay much attention to those. <EOS>
<BOS> “You don’t have a curse on you.” Ahmed says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, the old boss, Edmond actually acquired an egg and raised a Sotakian from a hatchling. Trained him to be a very literal cold-blooded assassin bodyguard. We all just called him Scales, but he never really had a proper name. He was very loyal too until he had some unknown disagreement with Edmond and just took off. Ed never told anyone to go get him either. Just said to let it go.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright, I suppose we can talk more. Just let me get this corpse off of me.” <EOS>
<BOS> Warts is mildly smug about you choosing his plan over Vera who in turn is obviously perturbed. She makes no pretenses about not wanting to be one of those stumbling about in the woods. You reassure her she can focus on her city activities since reassigning her would just cause unnecessary conflict in the long term anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> No, you went down that road before. Not going down it again especially not with someone you know practically nothing about. And you certainly aren’t going to take the risk of robbing Kenzer’s. There are easier targets, no need to take unnecessary chances. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yinen! Come on! We gotta get the hell out of here! Yinen!” you say and approach him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, then I guess you’ll have to get the priests of Dorna to cure you. I know you said you declined before since it all felt a little sketchy and you didn’t feel right about the ritual, but desperate times and all that.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh great…” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Fuck you Zal, just fuck you." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Closest thing to one around here I suppose. Anyway, thanks for not doing any major damage to them, I don’t have many students as it is. Now I assume you’re here to see me, so let’s head to my office.” <EOS>
<BOS> Along the way you and her talk about some of changes in the city. The discussion is fairly light and superficial, though Vera’s demeanor is pretty affectionate. You went into this with a flirty approach since you wanted to see if there was a complete personality change with her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, do I need to bring this in to recharge it at some point?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, but I know I can’t be as bad as you’re making out either. If I was so horrible, your boss wouldn’t be considering me.” <EOS>
<BOS> As you caress her breast, you can feel the temptation overwhelming you. Her body is just…perfect to you right now. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t really resist at this point though you do have to eventually stop her. <EOS>
<BOS> But with your thoughts, the dream is fading. You are rising up to consciousness. No! <EOS>
<BOS> "WHAT?! They had another child?! When?!" You exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I’m not dead yet, so don’t start sweating or celebrating prematurely. Okay, I’m off.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Now, Barus, fair is fair. He discovered our treasure, let us give him a gift!" Pelliandra passed her hand over the serpent and chest of jewels, until every color of the gems and flash of iridescence was passed into the snake's scales in ornate patterns. "Now, you can carry your prize with you, and all the animals will know you are noticed by the gods." <EOS>
<BOS> Sometimes you startle and launch into a tale of daring, or tragedy, or woe. Other times, you stare for hours into the heavens, as if hoping to see something beyond the stars. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well son, it’s because titles don’t mean anything; it’s the power you have that matters. I mean you just heard about a man that calls himself Governor of Hessla. Sounds pretty important right? Certainly sounds more important than boss. Except in the scheme of things he doesn’t have much power at all. He’s running a dying town, meanwhile I’m in charge of an entire island.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Well since I figure I'm already getting fucked, the least you could do is do me proper." <EOS>
<BOS> Suddenly, you know what you must do. You place the tankard on a nearby table and strap your sword on. Your possession are few, and you pack them in a traveling pack. The small lantern illuminating the room is extinguished, leaving you in the night’s darkness. Seth’s figure stands at the doorway, still. His crimson robe looks ceremonial in the backlight of the hallway’s torches. <EOS>
<BOS> Percy stands up, shaking your hand and leaves. <EOS>
<BOS> “You mean aren’t already?” Warts responds. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, shooting people is something you’re good at, so it might actually be easier anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> At best, from this height you MIGHT survive a fall with several broken bones and given what else is going on down in the streets, you probably wouldn’t survive too much longer. <EOS>
<BOS> Armed with this knowledge (And a broken egg) Tom wishes you luck before you leave. <EOS>
<BOS> Your mother gives you a fresh baked cookie, smelling of warmth and love and butternut. You take a bite, but then notice her face is blank. She crashes to the floor, only a doll wearing a flour-dusted blue apron. The cookie in your hand is mere salt dough. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay fine. I fucked up. Maybe I should have moved sooner. That’s on me and I’ll take whatever punishment you decide. However as soon as I found out about the Neroth spy skulking about, I acted. I mean maybe I should have come to you first, but I was so pissed after I interrogated that dickhead that I just lost it. I cut off that fuckers feet and hands and he was still laughing about how stupid we were for letting our secrets slip so easily.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Guess you were lucky me an’ da boys were out huntin’ this way. Too many humies in da forest nowadays.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re dragged across the floor and down some steps while the chaos of shouting and running is around you. <EOS>
<BOS> It isn’t until you get home that you allow yourself an emotional release. Within your explosive rage of breaking a few things and yelling, you eventually calm down. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, we're doing that, adding doors, adding tiled floors and all that stuff, but that's going to get taken care of later when the basic layout is finished." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> As if on cue, every priest and priestess at the table picks up their meat knife and slashes a line across their palms. They each make a fist and squeeze blood into the wine as it passes. <EOS>
<BOS> You sort of wonder if maybe you should seek out some sort of connection to see about joining the Ebony Claws, but then you figure you should probably get to know the city first before joining anyone. <EOS>
<BOS> "He said he wanted to make it like an underground version of the Klyton coliseum." Vaughn says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit. I never knew. I mean… fuck. You’ve been trying not to kill me for years.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> You part ways with Warts and get some sleep. <EOS>
<BOS> In a crash of dust and rock, the wyvern hits the bluff, its momentum leaving behind a long line of crater as if a dry canal. Unable to stop or grab a foothold, the beast slips over the cliff and disappears to crashing waves below, the Emperor along with it. You watch the scene unfold, still in the air. Shadowy, dark purple wisps emanate from your shoulder blades in the loose form of wings. Unlike the wyvern, the wings don’t flap, they merely float, swaying up and down, weightless, like a cloud. <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno. That really seems like a bad idea. I really wish you would just come to Jicol instead.” <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t quite tell at first from your prone position, but you see Annah standing behind Klint and a knife in her hand, which she’s using not just once on him, but several times. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, you…shit!” you say before you’re interrupted by Elana pulling a small ornate pistol and firing. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well after you collapsed, I paid some bums who apparently had been watching us the whole time to help me drag you to the nearest brothel, from there I found some of our people and they carried you the rest of the way here.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Not really.” <EOS>
<BOS> You tumble down the stairs and while you fortunately don’t break anything, you unfortunately smack your head so hard you’re dazed. If you could actually see anything in this darkness, you’d probably be seeing double. <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, you maintain your usual caution. <EOS>
<BOS> “The one on the floor who I tasted. This one loved you, yet you obviously sacrificed her to summon me. Why?” Tanya asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “What do you mean?” <EOS>
<BOS> But slavery is illegal almost everywhere on the planet - how are they operating without discovery? Even bribes and threats couldn't protect them for long - could they? <EOS>
<BOS> “What, you mean like Fel, the god of shadows? You told me their temple has ties to the ECS. You saying the Ebony Claw Syndicate is going to take over the city directly?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Me too! But first I have to show you this, come with me!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, yeah, I’ll manage. Sheesh.” <EOS>
<BOS> You meet Percy at the same tavern with the payment. Once again he’s very friendly. <EOS>
<BOS> The assistant is a little bewildered by your question, but he answers you and even tells you what it looks like when you ask. You then thank him and leave. <EOS>
<BOS> Then as you’re sleeping one day… <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m dead?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “I said SOME of you and as I remember, you weren’t one of them. In fact, most of you should be up there defending our interests. I’m not even asking you to be a fucking hero or defend the city because I know damn well that’s a pointless endeavor.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t mean to at first. It was an accident. I just wanted to get you something since I couldn’t find you. Here.” You say and pull the diamond necklace out of your bag. <EOS>
<BOS> A strip of forest appears, the leafy trees of Lantern forest waving to you in welcome on the sunny day. <EOS>
<BOS> These fanatics however, there’s a limit to their power for now. Right now they’ve grown and if left unchecked, who knows, they may take over the city. Sure you could flee and maybe you’d be fine. But you might also be running for the rest of your life as cults tend to not be satisfied with staying in one place and love to spread. Add their desire to summon demons and such into that mix and it might be best to nip this in the bud right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Hell, with the way you’re feeling, you’re starting to worry if you aren’t going to just fuck everyone on your way to the exit because it’s been YEARS since you’ve had sex and right now your dick isn’t caring. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, I’ll bet. Well I guess I’ll see you around.” <EOS>
<BOS> Rook looks at you for a while. You know that he’s trying to see if you’re lying about all this. You maintain your composure. He looks over at Bolt who seems to shrug, then he looks over at Lloyd who continues to nervously drink. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, okay, I’m not gonna say shit. However, I think I’d like my room to be free.” <EOS>
<BOS> But this time, you cannot stay for forty years with her memory. You carry her with you, now, and with that you bear an obligation to save all that she loved. As a wife, she has left you behind. As a muse, she has appointed you a hero. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, Tom’s mother was a lesbian?” <EOS>
<BOS> “If we went out on our own, aren’t we going to have to worry about retaliation?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay then, if you say it’s handled then I guess it is.” <EOS>
<BOS> A red skinned female demonic form complete with horns, wings, a tail and cloven hooves straddles your chest. <EOS>
<BOS> Long gone are the days of being a simple rogue. You’ve risen to a station even you never imagined. <EOS>
<BOS> But losing dreams, and memory, and magic - it has to be stopped! <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, your once second in command and dare I say…friend? Maybe even a little more? In any case, we had an interesting discussion with her and it didn’t even take much for her to agree to betray you when the time came. Guess once Ebony Claw, always Ebony Claw. She works with us now, indirectly of course, but we’re making more profit from her than we ever were with you that’s for sure.” <EOS>
<BOS> Flynt hands over a few gold coins to Ren who takes them and then heads over to a table. He then waves you over to come sit with him and his buddies. You figure it can’t hurt to hear what he has to say. <EOS>
<BOS> Suddenly the other prisoner has lunged at you and you’re taken completely off guard. <EOS>
<BOS> You hear the sound of a sharp object going into flesh, but it isn’t yours. Even in this dark, you can see the dead expression of Percy whose mouth now hangs open slack jawed and dripping blood all over you. His neck is also dripping blood and his body is even heavier on you. <EOS>
<BOS> Heather’s people take advantage of the situation and blast the demons with all they have. Without the other wizard up keeping the spell, they aren’t materializing any longer and stay permanently dead. Though you do see one leap away from the battle and out of sight. Looks like that will just be one more evil thing brought into this world. (Not that it’s going to make much of a difference) <EOS>
<BOS> “No, and even if we did, we wouldn’t waste it on a dead man.” Annah snaps. <EOS>
<BOS> “You fucking little scumbag bitch! Fucking dismiss me will you?” Clyde mutters and before you know it he’s punched you hard with his gauntlet-encased fist. You drop like a sack of potatoes. <EOS>
<BOS> You look at the crown. <EOS>
<BOS> You spend the next few weeks working by yourself and generally getting by. You’ve manage to nearly build up what you gave to Annah. <EOS>
<BOS> You get to near the top of the landing and then it goes completely dark. <EOS>
<BOS> “So they knew.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> "Let me accompany you for a ways, then," the priestess asks. "I am headed to Pefallis soon, anyways. We'll take my carriage, and I have a yacht berthed in Munir." <EOS>
<BOS> “Thanks boss.” Marco replies and takes his leave. <EOS>
<BOS> “I imagine she’s got some way of figuring it out. Make sure you dress nice though! I’ve heard about these things and if we go in looking like we crawled out of the sewers, they’ll turn us away, invitation or not.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, of course not. Anything goes really. Except attacks on the eyes.” she replies. “Do you think you’ll enter?” <EOS>
<BOS> Given that you didn’t see him until the last minute, you can only imagine that he’s a shadow blade from the temple of Fel and most likely here on the orders of the ECS. You quickly look around. <EOS>
<BOS> “Your dick says otherwise. Come on, I’m fucking ready and I know you are.” She says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright. Well, I can see this IS personal. On both sides. I mean I can’t very well disobey a direct order from my god can I? I can only guess you must have found this out from your son who is also in contact with our shadowy lord. I wouldn’t expect a godless heathen like you to understand, but if Fel is speaking to the boy then that only PROVES that he’s destined for greatness! Think of it, your son is one of Fel’s chosen! Surely you want what’s best for your son. No harm would come to him.” Percy says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Definitely not!" his mother cries. "That's far, far away - and you are too weak for adventures, besides." She rushes over to him and begins mopping his brow with a damp cloth. The boy rolls his eyes. The woman sees you watching, and clicks her tongue. "Ronin is ill, with the Ashen Death. It's a wasting sickness, common in these parts. I'd thank you not to give him any ideas about adventuring or leaving. You can sleep over there, on the floor." She sets about tending her son and ignores you for an hour, not even offering supper, even as she brings large amounts of food to her son. <EOS>
<BOS> “So what are you asking exactly?” <EOS>
<BOS> By nightfall, the woods disappear completely and become more open field. It’s at this point you drift in and out of sleep a bit. You see a few random homes and eventually you see the city. Much like Holgard, great walls surround it and the tops of tall structures can be seen looming above, though such structures already look fancier than any in Holgard. <EOS>
<BOS> When you get to the school, you’re not stopped by rebellious teenage wizards this time. Though you are stopped by… <EOS>
<BOS> “But I did it because I HAD to see you!” <EOS>
<BOS> Madeline almost looks a bit sad when you insist, but she tells you. <EOS>
<BOS> “That sounds fairly labor intensive, not to mention dangerous and I’m still leery about making Fel Temple our base. I was part of the Syndicate and saw some of the shit Rook could do with Fel’s divine power. I wouldn’t want to piss off a god.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Probably fucking a whore instead of taking care of fucking business as usual. And how do you know my fucking name? Who the fuck are you and what the fuck do you want?" <EOS>
<BOS> And then you feel a fist to the side of your face. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re about to tell Vaughn to shut the hell up when Zalmora interrupts. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe… (Sigh) I just don’t want to lose any more people especially when we may need them in the future.” Garrick says. <EOS>
<BOS> If it wasn’t obvious before, it’s very apparent now that this Ardan is incredibly insecure and most likely controlling. You can see why Kiera didn’t want to talk about him. <EOS>
<BOS> You then check your supplies, which aren’t much. You’ve got a few coins, but you aren’t excessively worried about that since food and water are more important out here in the wilderness. You’ve got a little food and water, but it isn’t going to last long. The only weapon you have currently is your dagger. <EOS>
<BOS> “Mm, well put the word out that I want to talk with the high priest or whoever. I’m sure it’ll get back to them eventually.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Stop. Don’t say anymore. Your voice doesn’t sound like hers and you’re already too friendly. I don’t want to ruin the illusion so let’s just get to it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s not as much fun as you’d think, trust me. I got some songs and a few stories out of it though. Spent some time in Delantium…and as I said I eventually made my way back to Teckleville. I’m guessing since you bothered to write mom and dad you might like to hear an update, since I know they never wrote you back.” <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t unconscious for too much longer however and at some point during the journey to the mass grave they dump you in, your life slips away altogether, sparing you from being buried alive. <EOS>
<BOS> At last the egg fell apart around him, and the man sat in a pile of indigo sand. <EOS>
<BOS> Taking advantage of the distraction, you grab Klint’s father’s wrist and wrestle the knife from his grip. The man is strong for his age, but between you, Checkers and even Annah hitting him in the head with a blackjack, you manage to disarm him and slide out from underneath. <EOS>
<BOS> “I told you, I want you to lift the curse that…” you begin to answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “You ok? You went dark there for a second. It’s normal to be nervous. I am, too, if I’m being honest, but we’re better than them. They’re no more than farmers conscripted and dressed up all pretty. I’d be surprised if their captain even has half the training we have.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Vera, what the hell are you doing here?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey boss, I got some hobs from da Spider Fangs dat wanna join wit us.” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s a hit and Klint touches the side of his face and looks at the fresh blood from the medium slash you landed on his cheek. For a moment, Klint is in disbelief. He begins shaking and breathing hard. You think he’s going to start crying or even run away because he realizes that this is a real fight with real consequences. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point you tell everyone that they can finally head back to the city to return to their former duties, which they seem relieved about. <EOS>
<BOS> "Here we go with that. Look Zal, we've been through all this before three years ago. I actually took your advice and you're still not happy, so let me make this easy for you. You're out." <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure, secret’s safe with me. Not like I got anyone to tell anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> “A sundial!” <EOS>
<BOS> Ponyride gets off his bed and approaches you with the usual hard stare that you’re getting used to by everyone that has to prove how tough they are. <EOS>
<BOS> “OW!” you shout. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well you still aren’t the one that’s potentially going to hang.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmm, I’m interested in just HOW well you’re doing in Jicol. I mean I figured you were always holding back a bit.” <EOS>
<BOS> “So…you’re a killer along with being a thief huh? That’s quite the combination kid. I’m sort of having a hard time believing it.” <EOS>
<BOS> He raises both arms, and the other mages do likewise. The white circle beneath you grows hot and glows red, but somehow doesn't burn. Rather, it feels like every bit of vitality and life is draining out of you, flowing into the mages, until you are left a husk of yourself, almost stone. <EOS>
<BOS> “We’re too good at this, we’re not going to fuck up.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Judging by the number of ears here, I'm going to guess he didn't just stop at the assigned targets." <EOS>
<BOS> “Sneaking in the city shouldn’t be an issue should it?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I guess we better get to it then. Um, I guess I’ll help you out.” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> And for those moments of intimacy under the night sky, the pair of you has blocked out everything else and it’s just you two. <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t make any detail out except the outline of a much taller impressive demonic looking figure. <EOS>
<BOS> You run to where you know the closest exit to be and run towards the better-lit corridor. Already several of your people are heading in your direction. <EOS>
<BOS> “Too predictable and self-important. I’m still grounded enough to know who and what I am.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Give us one about the harvest festival!” <EOS>
<BOS> The tracks in the forest are easy enough to follow. The raiding party didn't exactly spend time, well, covering their tracks. Plus, covering the footprints and broken branches of a group of men takes time. The party was designed for destruction, not clean-up. <EOS>
<BOS> Kelsam looks at you as he drips his share of blood into the cup. "Will you join us, honored guest?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe the halfbreed really is dead if he hasn’t returned yet. I certainly hope that’s the case.” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Zal's got a bit of a point. This isn't exactly the most glamorous of a position and you could certainly do better than hiding out in these filthy sewers. <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve never pondered this before, but maybe it’s due to reading too much philosophy during the trip, but what if you’ve changed things? <EOS>
<BOS> The “voice” you’re hearing could even be some sort of protection to scare rogues such as yourself into dropping the crown. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, I’m not asking you to put your asses on the line at all. I was just told that you’d have something to help take down this Inquisitor asshole who seemingly has almost as much magical protection as you lot do. I mean I can pay you guys.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Once, in the lands of the frigid south, far from here in a kingdom of ice, a noble captured a rare nightingale. Its song was sweet, as the bird was known for, but its feathers were a bright scarlet rather than the usual dull brown. The noble was enamored with his prize, and spent a great deal of his fortune on a golden cage to house it and lavish parties to show off its brilliant plumage and heart-rending song. <EOS>
<BOS> Right along the idea where you left the fucking inn because you didn't want to settle down and live like some regular jerk off. Would it really have been so terrible? It couldn't have been worse than THIS. <EOS>
<BOS> You spend the rest of the week more or less taking it easy and mentally preparing yourself for taking another trip. You didn’t envision yourself leaving Klyton like this, but you’re starting to look forward to the idea. Maybe your dick’s not so dumb. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re a fucking asshole.” Hank replies. <EOS>
<BOS> The Church of Joachim being outlawed in the city wasn’t too surprising given all the trouble that was caused and how Holgard in general tends more towards embracing sin and vice rather than moving away from it. Still, sort of funny that the faith is now in the company of it’s eternal enemy, Neroth as far as being illegal. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera still doesn’t look in your direction still crying. You run your hand briefly over her hair and then move in closer to hug her. <EOS>
<BOS> “So wait, are you suggesting that I kill Hank? I don’t think I could do that even if I never had the highest opinion of him to begin with.” Amanda says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Everything is good when Holgard isn’t in fucking chaos. I give it a few more years before the next crisis, but until then just enjoying the relative calm. So was that it Warts?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Might as well go big. If Kol is going to speak with Fel, we might as well try to use it to our benefit. According to Kol, Fel finds what we’ve done with the temple to be amusing, so we can’t be completely on his bad side. Look, I’m going to speak with Kol again before he goes to bed and really, this isn’t going to be a regular thing. If Kol gets the information he needs, then the enchanted medallion or ring when I get it is going right back on the next time he sleeps.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I see. So you’re going home then? Can you do that?” <EOS>
<BOS> You begin to feel very drained and dyhydrated. You gasp for Tanya to stop, but she doesn’t. She has now taken on a less human looking appearance and the noises she’s making definitely aren’t loving moans of ecstasy. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s what you told me.” <EOS>
<BOS> This is more than enough to surprise her and cause her reel back a bit. You immediately look around for a way to escape. However the crowd is converging on you, including Reginald, but he’s instead telling everyone to back off. <EOS>
<BOS> You step inside and Yinen closes the door before walking into a humble living area. <EOS>
<BOS> If you ever get back to Hessla, you swear to the gods that you're leaving and never setting foot on a ship again. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera’s usually got good instincts, if she’s saying that you should at least speak with Peter, then you probably should do it. You can always speak to Heather after you come back depending on how the meeting goes. <EOS>
<BOS> Not that she necessarily needs them because apparently she can create little fireballs from her palms and is preparing to throw another at Rook. <EOS>
<BOS> “Quite sure. I’ve studied infernals long enough to know that you haven’t been cursed by one. Now I do detect traces of infernal presence on you, but given what you told me about your relationship with this Tanya girl, that’s hardly surprising and that’s always going to be there.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Which man? Where is he?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “He’s not, because I didn’t get this from fucking Flynn, I got this from a different Dornan.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, some big guy was looking for you yesterday.” The merchant remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, these will fetch you a nice price. Might take a few days though. You alright with waiting?” Yinen remarks examining your gems. <EOS>
<BOS> In the weeks to come, you settle into your new job without much difficulty. Your main task at first is helping in reinforcing order in the city after the invasion since there is a decrease in Holgard soldiers that can patrol the streets. Establishing spies and informants about the various goings on in the city is fairly easy since the few Nocturnal League folks that remained loyal (and were still alive) are practically begging you for a chance to join. <EOS>
<BOS> The wax doesn't quite drown out the song completely, but it's helping enough that you at least don't feel like you're falling under some sort of enchantment now. <EOS>
<BOS> With the tavern secured, you take your next steps in this plan. <EOS>
<BOS> Shade then tells you he’ll be preparing things on his side and in the unlikely event that you actually manage to get Dornan help and depending on how much help, you two can plan out your next move at that time. With those last words, Shade seemingly disappears into the darkness completely. <EOS>
<BOS> Well you expected some resistance, but you figured it would be half assed negotiation, not Marco finding the balls to stand up to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “I can see by your face you aren’t pleased with that last statement, but I think you should look upon it as a compliment. Just think, YOU managed to do what the Syndicate could not. You made a success here with no competition and you built it all from the ground up. Granted you did use some of our people and even altered our product…Purple Wish? Come on, we all know that’s just an inferior version of Blue Dream, but it’s probably for the best that you didn’t try to rip us off directly. We might have very well sent assassins in that case.” Percy says. <EOS>
<BOS> You go for your pistol, but Toz immediately sees this. More of your people arrive at the end of the corridor ready to open fire. Even with shadow magic, he’s bound to get hit without much space to dodge in. <EOS>
<BOS> "Gotta say bro, didn't see you marrying one like that. Didn't see you marrying anyone actually." Your sister remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Still no sign of Tanya. You begin to worry if something happened to her if she came here at all. It also crosses you mind that it’s possible she got held up before coming here. Rook did say he was sending some of his people to go actively hunt Guild members. For all you know she ran afoul of one of those groups or had to help other Guild members. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re taking over.” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> You struggle with the driver until he realizes he isn’t strong enough to take it from you. Just as you’re about to yank it completely away, the driver lets go and you pull so hard you lose balance. The driver then takes advantage of this by pushing you off the carriage. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately life doesn’t always go as planned and one day the young man’s father died and to make matters worse it turned out his father who only had the best intentions for his son, had been borrowing from a dangerous loan shark. <EOS>
<BOS> You pull the trigger, blowing Vera’s brains out the other side of her head onto the wall and also getting blood on you in the process. <EOS>
<BOS> After Brother Samuel leaves the room, you turn to Kassi. “Sorry if I took it too far.” <EOS>
<BOS> “That is all I found in the safe after I killed those two idiots. I looked all over for a hiding place, thinking they might have it elsewhere, but I guess they weren’t dumb enough to hide it on the premises. In any case it’s pretty obvious Rook should be getting way more coin than he’s been getting and you’re obviously trying to get him killed by the directors…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad to hear it, but what about Sneaks? You think he’s dead?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Work for you? Doing what exactly?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> "We could always look for Scales." Vaughn jokes in an attempt to lighten the mood. <EOS>
<BOS> Hank’s former happy expression drops and he sits down in a nearby chair with a hand over his mouth. <EOS>
<BOS> “Mmm…” the woman says and strokes your arm as you pass by. The guy she’s kissing takes no notice; he’s too focused on her. <EOS>
<BOS> Doesn’t look like they took out the League hob camp though since you don’t find them among the dead (you do find some of the Watch dead though). Given that they’re probably a lot more experienced outdoors they probably retreated further into the forest. While you’re not exactly some wilderness tracker, hobs aren’t exactly the cleanest and tend to leave trash around. You begin to follow the trail as best you can. <EOS>
<BOS> No one dismounts for dinner - instead, the servants pass up and down the line with a light supper of jerky and flatbread, or rolls stuffed with sweet dates. <EOS>
<BOS> While Annah has certainly improved some of her skills she’s ultimately just too damn impatient and lazy for all this and despite her bitching about being the “distraction” during some of your jobs, she relies on it a lot. <EOS>
<BOS> “If you’re talking about who I think you are, they better not be jamming it into my back considering we’re supposed to be on the same side now.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Heather we really don’t have to if…” you start to say before she’s all over you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey you! What are you doing?” one asks. <EOS>
<BOS> One of the master mages casts a spell, and a translucent vision fills the center of the room. Rioters in blue, tearing down the Academy gates. The Academy on fire! The Head Mage himself, cut through with a blade. The vision jumps from image to image, but they all speak of a night of death. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, I suppose I might need to show off my assassin skills.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, sure I guess so.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve got to think. Of course, while you’re thinking about how you’re going to survive in this new situation, you still might need a lot of coin to make it a little easier. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m sure the rats have stripped both corpses by now…(sigh) so who’s the new boss?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Um… sure. Don’t you have school though?” <EOS>
<BOS> You return to Mr. Reynolds' office in the next few days with the money and all the necessary information. <EOS>
<BOS> There really isn’t anything pleasurable about any of this, especially how hard Madeline is riding you, tightly squeezing your arms and making unnatural noises the whole time. You also feel like your dick is on fire the entire time. The only thing you can do is hope it ends quickly, which fortunately it does and you soon release. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hence why we’re also close allies to a group of wizards.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait a moment, what about all the thieves in the Guild headquarters when the Claw comes to take it down?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah and you not show up at all? Not risking that. The best I can do is give you a thousand for hearing me out as your taste of the rewards to come.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Well...um...shit..fuck it. Alright. Not like I got anything better to do." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Warts steps over a couple bodies before addressing you again. He gives you a more serious look than he normally does. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re not coming back are you?” Heather says. <EOS>
<BOS> The dwarf sounds good, but he sounds like he's going to be really expensive. At lot more than the bum anyway. Of course the bum might be unreliable. You say you'll think about both as you go ask other Talons if they know anybody. <EOS>
<BOS> “Honestly Madeline I don’t know at this point! I mean never mind the fact that you killed one of my more productive members, but your actions are pretty damn batshit insane. You got goblins doing your bidding, you’re stalking and spying on me, you showed no signs of being a killer before and yet you just killed a man who actually DID love you in his limited way. I mean you’re fucking dangerous, how the hell am I supposed to trust someone like that?” <EOS>
<BOS> You then see a person dressed in simple clothing coming out of the forest. He’s a little shorter than you, in fact he’s a little greener than you too. Doesn’t look like an orc though, not nearly big or massive enough. Goblin perhaps, but he’s taller than one and almost a bit human looking. A short green human with a few warts on his face and a bigger than average nose. <EOS>
<BOS> The rings are what surprise you most. You’re no jeweler, but you have stolen enough cheap baubles in the past that you can tell a fake when you examine it in greater detail. The gems in the rings are actually common, but altered slightly (especially their color) to resemble more valuable ones. Even the ring is gold plated rather than pure. Looks like Graham wasn’t as rich as he made out. <EOS>
<BOS> P.S. <EOS>
<BOS> Zamed’s comments are enough to draw some mean looks from your hobs. <EOS>
<BOS> Looks like you’ve got a new prospect. <EOS>
<BOS> “Nah, not dat. It’s just a few of dem are young teenagers and Vera said youz might have a problem with dat.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Is there something else?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> On the last morning, you grab your things and flee. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the hell are you doing? You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you get tired of being in your room and decide to go take advantage of your free food and drink. <EOS>
<BOS> You first think about taking a carriage there to save yourself a walk, but then you figure you'd rather save the money. It'll be good to for you to get some regular exercise for a change as well. For several years you feel like you've just been slowly letting yourself go to pot while you were running the Crimson Talons from the inn. <EOS>
<BOS> “That isn’t even my name anymore worm. I have become something much greater and I have long shed any connection to my pathetic mortal years.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck. That was a lot. You good?” Vera says wiping off her mouth a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Really? That place is so fucking boring.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m a little concerned about her too, since the last message we got was six months ago from her and she said she was having some success in her endeavors.” <EOS>
<BOS> The moss beneath him moved, the dirt beneath him thrummed. What was this? What he had taken for stone was not a stone, but an egg. A large egg, gray, and covered in moss and soil. <EOS>
<BOS> "I see the Cavendish freak finally got what was coming to him," one of the other men mutters. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the name of the medicine I need?” <EOS>
<BOS> Garrick begins to go into a plan to start ambushing the cultists, but also to ambush a few Ebony Claws and plant their bodies among the dead cultists so the living ones can stumble upon them and vice versa. In the meantime he says he’s going to try to grease the right palms to gain some sort of meeting with Reginald and appear as an “ally” against the Ebony Claw so Reginald will tell his people to leave the Guild alone. <EOS>
<BOS> “What did you have in mind?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, and then you stabbed him in the throat and killed him. Why are you yelling at me?!” Annah remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Warts shakes his head while giving a slight broken tooth grin. <EOS>
<BOS> “I guess that makes sense.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I know. I know. And I'm glad you were concerned about me." Zal says embracing you. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe you're having some "good deed" moment during this dark hour, but the old guy actually has been more or less alright with you. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not some young prince to be misguided. It’s clear you want something from me, otherwise you would have attacked me same as the others,” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I have a hard time believe either pose a danger to you,” he answers. <EOS>
<BOS> “So you’re the guy that killed an orc and has been living here with Keira? You are far less impressive than I heard about.” A voice says. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point you start grabbing all the loot on the bed and putting it into a nearby bag. Then you go to where you keep your “savings” and take some of that out and throw that into the bag as well. You then thrust the bag of valuables into Annah’s hand. <EOS>
<BOS> “I have! But I keep seeing her in my dreams! And those dreams have been becoming more frequent lately. In these dreams, we spend time together and talk and laugh and…” <EOS>
<BOS> "Friend squirrels," he called to a few nearby, "could you help me dig?" <EOS>
<BOS> When you arrive in the general vicinity, you finally get a good look at what’s going on. You see several creatures that remind you of some sort of demonic dwarves since they’re about the same height, and pretty stocky. They’re attacking a group of wizards wearing purple robes which you’re guessing are Heather’s people though you don’t see her. <EOS>
<BOS> You make it half way through before Jenny’s boyfriend grabs your legs. He must be on the wrestling team or something because you cannot escape his grip and he easily yanks you back. <EOS>
<BOS> “I came across a boy being pursued by a shade. I do not understand how the boy resisted its possession. <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit…ugh something’s wrong! My entire body feels like its on fire! (Sob) Please…I..ARGH!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yep, but I ended up getting more than just ten.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I was in the basement stealing the Tivan Crystal.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes, and I'm saying we don't have to live that way anymore. We could go completely legit and live comfortably rather than living in paranoia of going to jail or hanging in a cage." <EOS>
<BOS> “So what are you saying exactly?” <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Camid and you are face to face and it's half expected that someone is going to go for a weapon. Camid is obviously severely tempted, but he's not quite confident enough to believe he'll survive the exchange. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m saying we hire some pirates to attack our ship as it approaches Jicol. Naturally the Jicol navy is going to go into action and our ship safely gets in the harbor while they’re distracted.” <EOS>
<BOS> As you walk through the gates and towards the mansion, you shake your head. <EOS>
<BOS> The captain thinks about going for his own flintlock, while you’re confident that you’ll take him and at least a couple of his people out before you get mobbed. If you’re lucky, your people will move in quick enough that you’ll be able to fight your way through the chaos and run your ass out of Jicol. It’s not the best odds, but you’ve been in worse situations. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes, and blew them up with explosives. What? Did you think that he was just a simple brute that was going to bludgeon them all with a club?" <EOS>
<BOS> Marco just nods silently, he’s obviously just glad you aren’t punishing him and he’s back on dry land. You didn’t think much of Marco and his “gang” when you first met them, and to be honest you still don’t, but you suppose they’ve come a long way since those days or at least the ones that have survived have. <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t do anything! Where’s dad?!” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Goodbye Tanya.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You take your leave and walk around to the back of Gilo’s to check out the back door and that’s when you see his little boy tossing out a bunch of bones in a box. It’s a pretty big box (for a Halfling child) and the boy is struggling to carry it. <EOS>
<BOS> These raids are practically slaughters and you're not particularly getting any thrill out of doing them especially since there's barely been any loot to be had. Last raids you did go on we're more about scavenging the town's fruit supplies and medicine rather than valuables. <EOS>
<BOS> Soon… <EOS>
<BOS> “Disobedient to your parents huh? Now I know you’re not fit for this city!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Ey! I’m up! I’m up! I ain’t forgot wat we’re supposed ta do, an’ I’m more than ready! I’m not drunk, I just had a little rest like you did.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright we’ll stop here for tonight and set up camp. Anders and Levin, you two can watch Mr. Scars and the kid and make sure they can’t escape.” The sergeant says. <EOS>
<BOS> "This is the only one of its kind," you say. "It is "Scarlet Hoof," the last perfume designed by the great perfumer Callius." <EOS>
<BOS> Year 31 <EOS>
<BOS> However, he’s still pragmatic enough that he’d probably give leniency to a group that actively helped him and a deal could very well be made as you said. Vera goes on to say she truly believes that this is the best chance for the Nocturnal League to survive in Holgard. <EOS>
<BOS> “I broke up with her, you presumptuous whore.” You say as she walks away waving a dismissing hand back at you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wha…what are you doing?” Annah asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. Um, hadn’t heard much about this, but then the Grand Matriarch doesn’t tell everyone everything I suppose. I’ll go get her.” <EOS>
<BOS> Scales then crouches down and starts inspecting the egg pieces. You take this as an opportunity to leave and you back away into the darkness, not even taking your lantern. You have no idea how the hell you’re going to safely cross back over that crumbling walkway, but that’s going to have to be another struggle for later. <EOS>
<BOS> “You think big kid, just hope you’re right.” <EOS>
<BOS> You continue to back away and dodge, but you aren’t sure how much longer you can keep this up because Ardan seems to have a lot of energy in trying to kill you. <EOS>
<BOS> You trudge through the forest for quite sometime and eventually it gets dark, but you still haven’t seen any signs of bandits or anyone else really. Warts doesn’t seem to be concerned, but you’re constantly alert, thinking behind every tree lies an ambush. <EOS>
<BOS> About a few minutes after she leaves, Vaughn speaks up. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, don’t you need to know where Jake even is?” <EOS>
<BOS> “What makes you think he won’t get sabotaged again by either group? I mean the Ebony Claw might not have a direct presence here, but they’re still making some coin from us. Same is some what true of the Felians, though different reasons. They’re allies with the ECS, so they tend to help them.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I thought you were staying away from her ever since you took out Reginald.” Sneaks asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Another good haul!” Jake laughs. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, I guess we do. Or we don't. Look, I've never been quite sure how deep your feelings have ever been towards me. To be honest I suppose I'm not quite sure of my own feelings are towards you. I like to think we do have a fondness for each other on some level. I mean we stayed married longer than some people I've know that we're head over heels in love with each other. Not exactly sure if what we have is love, but I guess in some way I think it's close, all things considered." <EOS>
<BOS> You have your people tell you when Teklis arrives in the city, though to your surprise when he finally does, he comes directly to your home escorted by one of your people. <EOS>
<BOS> The staff almost burns in your hands, like it wants to be used. You drop your own walking stick to carry it, and rush for the drapes, hiding just as the mob bursts through the doors. They angrily shout to each other in disappointment. No doubt they expected to find the High Mage. <EOS>
<BOS> As you pass the guard, Annah thanks him and says that you’ll both say a prayer in Joachim’s name for his kindness. <EOS>
<BOS> "Says who? You can walk away from ANYTHING as long as you aren't in prison or the grave and either of those places are exactly where you'll be heading if this keeps up." <EOS>
<BOS> “I guess that’s one way of looking at it. Okay kid, I’ll get that egg.” <EOS>
<BOS> A crushing blow to your head is felt, though fortunately not enough to knock you out completely, just enough to cause you to fall to the ground. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because Elias was a bastard boss that kept most of the money and then would promptly blow it all on alcohol and Blue Dream. I know with a more levelheaded person like our current boss running things, a new slave market could be even more profitable.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh?” you answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe we need to relocate.” <EOS>
<BOS> Once, in the garden of the gods, 12 precious map pieces were given to the noble and mighty among the animals. But they would not work together, and so the treasure lay untouched. <EOS>
<BOS> The next morning you arrive at the appointed location where other Ebony Claw members are waiting for you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, certainly a different idea I had about infiltrating the city which involved sending a few to scale the walls or swim around and attack silently over the course of a few days.” <EOS>
<BOS> You knew it was a bad idea to pity fuck Annie a few more times. <EOS>
<BOS> He falls to the ground and you successfully get the horse free. You’re about to mount it when the driver once again attempts to stop you. <EOS>
<BOS> "That being said, if you don't want to stay together that's fine. I always thought this was going to be temporary anyway. I mean I think I could even work it out if you still wanted to manage this place. My point is though, this inn is going to be a legitimate business from now on and if you're not willing to at least go that route, well we need to say goodbye now." <EOS>
<BOS> You naturally get to the meeting a little early and have some of your people hiding nearby in case something happens, but honestly you’re not worried. Eventually Marco and three of his people of them arrive. Two of them look a little jittery. Another one is female and given that she’s hanging on Marco’s arm, it must be his little trashy girlfriend. <EOS>
<BOS> You realize what Mr. Reynolds is trying to do. He’s trying to talk you into some “contract.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, I’m not judging. So of course I’ll need some more information on the lay out of this place.” <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s very pragmatic of the Syndicate, but unusual for the Order of Fel. I mean you guys that are heavily into the shadow magic side of things tend to follow that first.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What!? I’ve been waiting fucking hours!” you exclaim. <EOS>
<BOS> “Damn, you don’t know how good it is to be out of that fucking thing! I should have been out of there yesterday.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Trasila," you ask, "would you propose an animal for the tale?" <EOS>
<BOS> At this point these five men are nearby you, yet are still talking like you aren’t here. You feel like you should stand up at this point. <EOS>
<BOS> As you grab the railing, Tanya grabs your arm and hoists you over it. You almost feel like she’s going to yank your arm off, but of course you see a glimpse of her face again as she’s pulling you up and you’re almost smitten enough to forget all about the extreme danger you’re currently in. <EOS>
<BOS> Your mind draws back to your childhood, the day of the massacre. You were powerless to stop the attack, even with yours and Kassi’s offensive. You dropped many soldiers that day. Now that you’re of age, many more will fall this night. Then, you were limited by childhood. Even with your extensive training, a prolonged battle against adult strength would eventually be futile. Your hand grips tighter around your hilt. You’re no longer limited, burdened by lack of years. You feel strong, powerful, the Imperial soldiers before you might as well be children. You strike them down easily as if they were. <EOS>
<BOS> “I got protection of my own to do. Don’t worry about me. Just do what I tell you!” <EOS>
<BOS> “You mean like for underground gladiator matches? Eh…yeah we bought a few of pit slaves once and it didn’t go so well. You want to talk about upkeep, those bastards need upkeep because you need to keep them in good condition for a potential buyer. Not to mention on almost every occasion they tried to escape or kill one of us. One of them actually succeeded in killing four people under Elias before being subdued. I don’t think it’s worth it and I find it funny that you’re perfectly okay with that brand of slavery as opposed to the sexual kind. You really are a prude aren’t you?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Why not come with the Grandmaster? You are among the few he’s invited in,” the wisp answers. <EOS>
<BOS> “It could work,” you say. “What do you think, Lorthander?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, real quick. Her name is Tanya and if you want to make yourself happy, you will NOT pursue that one. Just forget about her. I know it’s difficult right now, but you’ll be better off. Trust me.” Sneaks says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sorry, kid. (cough) I lost myself for a second there,” he weakly whispers. <EOS>
<BOS> You decide to pay a visit to the library, as much in curiosity as hope of coin. When you were a child, libraries could be found in near every town and village, carrying copies of fables and fairytales that anyone could check out and enjoy for free. <EOS>
<BOS> “Only out of survival.” <EOS>
<BOS> “The man with two blades. He’s recovering back in my home.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What? I didn’t even see her leave. In fact I thought she was still out there.” <EOS>
<BOS> Just when he arrived at the fallen animal, a flock of crows fly out from a nearby gap in the castle, filling the air with squawking and flapping of wings. Ekk’a instantly ducked, and fired an arrow, dropping one of the birds. Ekk’a suddenly felt another’s presence. Mimicking the buck, his head lifts, searching for a sight or sound from another. His eyes found a gnarled staff, propping up the hunched body of a shadowy figure. The figure’s dark hood is open, and yet Ekk’a can’t see the face underneath. It’s black like a cloudy night blocking the stars and moon. <EOS>
<BOS> “Your intentions are nothing but self serving. You sense change is coming and you want to be on the right side when it comes. It’s perfectly understandable. You are the leader of the infamous Nocturnal League correct?” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re not going to kill me. And if you try I think you know I can take care of myself. And even in the off chance you do, well then it’s not going to matter because I’ll be dead.” <EOS>
<BOS> Minutes pass. You watch the steady, clockwork sentries walk back and forth. Their steps seem timed like they are calculating each step with the second. Typical Empire, sacrificing the mind of the soldier for their rigid structure. They’re nothing more than dogs learning a few tricks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, it was just one time. She was ten and she wanted to know about sex and I figured it was my duty as a parent to…” <EOS>
<BOS> “She ain’t got a fucking choice. She’s going and you’re staying. Last time I remember, I was the boss around here and have the final say.” Tom says with a bit more authority than you’re used to. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure. Sure. Take your time. You certainly earned it. Why don’t you tell me what happened, I’m sure it was a difficult battle.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Huh? Nah, I just have a strong feeling that fate is going to catch up to her. Anyway, I don’t want to dwell on it anymore, let’s just get to work. In fact before shit happened yesterday, I was thinking about potential expansion.” <EOS>
<BOS> You take that chance that you’re quick enough and Garrick is so emotional right now that he’s not focused like he should. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ll give it back to you when we get to safety, staying around here is just not a good idea…shit!” <EOS>
<BOS> Lot can change in just a few years, some things you predicted, others not so much. <EOS>
<BOS> Unsurprisingly before you even get in the place, you’re getting a lot of dirty looks from obvious Ebony Claw members on the streets. Your reception is no warmer when you get inside and you get stopped instantly by a group of EC members. <EOS>
<BOS> “I gotta say, I did not see that one coming. That was your second in command at one time right?” Heather asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You grab your dagger and rise to your feet, and that’s about all you manage to do before whatever the creature is rushes forward and completely overwhelms you. <EOS>
<BOS> “HEY! Grab the damn rope!” a voice shouts from above. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I’m interested, but how are you sneaking past the city gates. I can’t imagine the city guards are going to just let someone in that just escaped from a hanging cage.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I need more money!” <EOS>
<BOS> “As of right now Vaughn, you’re head of the Crimson Talons. Good luck.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well…” <EOS>
<BOS> “After they were done with them, I’d say they were generous enough to put them out their misery. Sometimes I wish they’d done the same to me, but I guess I was just too important. Lucky me.” <EOS>
<BOS> The quarters where you and the hobs were staying at is a wreck. While there aren’t any bodies it’s obvious what happened with all the blood everywhere. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? I don’t believe you. Vera would never betray me!” <EOS>
<BOS> “So what is it that you need exactly?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Underground tunnel? There isn’t much they could dig without risking hitting water and flooding said tunnels. In case you didn’t realize, we’re on a fucking island.” <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually Klyton is in sight and you quicken your pace, anxious to get to your destination. <EOS>
<BOS> “I took it when they were stripping your clothes off, I dunno why I did. I really don’t understand why I did anything. I thought I was past this. I need to get my head together and figure this shit out.” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s okay, I probably would have done the same. I came on so strong I guess it would be natural for you to have some suspicion.” Annah says. <EOS>
<BOS> “You did? I knew it! But, why didn’t you ever return it? Why didn’t you ever tell me?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> "The greatest," you nod. <EOS>
<BOS> You follow the directions Tom gave you and finally get to the abandoned part of the sewers he mentioned. Actually it doesn’t even look like the rest of the sewers at this point. The tunnel is partially collapsed or has great gaping holes leading to who the hell knows where. Beyond this first tunnel, you can only imagine that it’s going to be in even worse repair. <EOS>
<BOS> Marco nods his head and thanks you for not killing him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ragar!” he spits. “The Unbroken will never return.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well,” you say. “In five day’s time, we bring the Empire to its knees. Seth, don’t take unnecessary risk. Fall back and preserve the prime army if things turn south. They’ll likely have wyverns, but their aerial assault counts for nothing in the tight passageway.” <EOS>
<BOS> “The fuck do you want fancy boy? Don’t you have addicts to keep in line out front or managing the rest of those other losers?” Mr. Dream asks. <EOS>
<BOS> You think about this a few moments and then throw up your hands. <EOS>
<BOS> You never were much of a reader before, but seeing how long this trip is going to be, you figured it would be a good idea to take some literature with you along the way. If you do manage to get back, you might even be able to sell this stuff for a hefty profit. Galpatis items would no doubt go for a lot. (And you’ve collected a few other small items with this in mind) <EOS>
<BOS> “Gentlemen! I’m sure you both played your role.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Damnit, Gubbins! I told ya ta wait in da corridor!” Warts reprimands the child. <EOS>
<BOS> “But Boss, what about…” Marco starts to say before a loud explosion from one of the corridors suddenly interrupts him. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya looks at you very irritated by your words. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t think you’re getting off that easy,” the voice lifelessly speaks. <EOS>
<BOS> As you approach the Grove, you find the forest growing richer. The cricks and brooks babble excitedly; the flowers burst forth in fragrant, erumpent displays; the birds show off with ornamented tunes, as if composed especially for this moment and this place; and even the soil takes on a richer brown, growing spongy and easy on your tired feet. A deep, electric feeling pulls you forward, but you resist it, walking slowly, aiming to etch every sight and sound and smell into your memory. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course part of your success isn’t just all your own talent. It probably helps that the city is once again experiencing an inner conflict. Not a revolution or anything like that, but more of a religious faction war. Holgard has always had a bit of a problem with religion and it’s the fact that there is too much of it in the city. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s a lot harder to open a doorway without arms,” the wisp says. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 33 <EOS>
<BOS> Now several others stand up to join the troublemaker. Though a few of them look unsure. Some don’t take a side and just quietly slink back into a place where they might be safe from the fighting. <EOS>
<BOS> Realizing that she’s in no mood to listen to reason and is just determined to get you out of here, you release her and shake her mutt off your leg and turn to leave. Before you get out the door though she throws something at you which hits you in the head pretty hard. <EOS>
<BOS> "Good to hear," you nod, not quite sure if it is the truth or if the boy is just making the best of it. <EOS>
<BOS> “I will.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No.” <EOS>
<BOS> “No, this needs to be settled now and I’m not going to wait around.” Ardan replies. <EOS>
<BOS> “No. Didn’t move there.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> You look at Randi who, as far as whores go isn’t exactly top tier, though it looks like she’s put a little more effort into her job today. <EOS>
<BOS> "Good. I'm glad. Who knew you'd find it here though huh? Strange how things work out. I gotta ask though, The Crims Inn? Nice little play on words, but how'd you come up with that name?" <EOS>
<BOS> In any case, Zal's right in that it's not her fault at all, this is mostly Vaughn's fuck up, but really it's yours as well because you really should have learned all the facts first. You are the one running the Talons after all. <EOS>
<BOS> You kneel in the dirt, taking in your surroundings. You breathe in the fresh forest air and visualize the upcoming battle. It will be dark. You will use the cover of night to strike hard, quick, not spending too much time in one area. Likewise, it will be harder to see reinforcements coming. Still, there will be much confusion in their ranks. You imagine your technique, your practice. You’ve flowed through the forms countless times physically and mentally. The upcoming battle will require acute focus from both aspects of your training. <EOS>
<BOS> When you get to the city gates, you find them to be heavily guarded and you’re stopped. <EOS>
<BOS> “Just telling you what I’m expecting.” <EOS>
<BOS> But there isn't much to see in the Ashen Veldt. It's flat, except a few low foothills here and there to the west. It's mostly gray soil and pale-sage, scrubby plants. The breeze is cool and would almost be pleasant, if it didn't carry the ashy topsoil with it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well sure, we always got room. In fact why are you coming to me about it, and not Vera anyway?” <EOS>
<BOS> You peek around the corner and see Rook’s desk full of books on fire, and Rook himself has fallen flat on the ground, but otherwise unhurt. <EOS>
<BOS> “(sniffle) Here. Take this. Think of it as a wedding gift.” He says and hands you a few silvers which you take. <EOS>
<BOS> “What do you mean?” you inquire. <EOS>
<BOS> You immediately turn around and run back up the stairs, though Wart is busily trying to get past you. In between that, the heavier pack and the vomit still covering your boots, you end up slipping and tumbling down the stairs and into the cultists. <EOS>
<BOS> “So you guys are all slavers huh?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> "Whatever possessed you to be out in this?" she asks, glaring at you. <EOS>
<BOS> "Muse-mad," others whisper. <EOS>
<BOS> “Love I guess? I mean Jake was a bloodthirsty asshole that was a terrible leader, but I think he cared about me as much as he understood it anyway. And he had a certain charm, at times.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you get to the palace you’re sort of relieved since you half expect that you’re going to get robbed on your way there. A guard stops you at the gates and you show your personalized invitation at which point you’re waved through. <EOS>
<BOS> HA HA HA HA HA <EOS>
<BOS> “What?! No! Where did you get that idea? We don’t need to summon anything, but it’s still going to take a little prep work on my end first. I would like you to come back here in a couple days and see me if possible.” <EOS>
<BOS> “If it was in pursuit of greater knowledge and wisdom, I’d be willing to make that sacrifice.” <EOS>
<BOS> The shouting of several watchmen is heard followed by Vera shouting back and returning fire. She attempts to pull you up, but the bullet has shattered your spine and you’re not going anywhere <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well scruples doesn’t win wars.” <EOS>
<BOS> You see a very well dressed older man in a suit rather than wizard robes standing before you. He also carries a satchel with him. After he greets you, you return the greeting and dismiss your agent who escorted him. <EOS>
<BOS> “It might not have been necessary to wallow in the sewers if they had another distraction.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wut? No! Dis one ain’t robbin’ merchants, well at least not for another few years anyway. Dis iz my son.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Apologies Countess, some of the new recruits thought to take advantage of a few of them last night. They’ve already been dealt with, even sold the ringleader this morning.” Halford replies. <EOS>
<BOS> After swiftly disarming the trap, you grab the valuables inside which consists mainly of gold coins and couple pieces of expensive looking jewelry. Not a bad haul. Annah picked a good home to break into even if you would have liked a little more time to case the place first. <EOS>
<BOS> “I never enter a building without an escape plan. Ah, here we are,” he comments. <EOS>
<BOS> Without another word, Bolt shoots Lloyd in the throat, who clutches his neck and gurgles a bit before he slumps down dead. <EOS>
<BOS> For an hour, you wander like a drunken man in the Grove, reeling to and from Ivani, the other muses, and a central well covered in vines. It seems everything wants your attention, all at once. In a moment of brief lucidity, you realize you must do something soon, before you descend completely into madness. <EOS>
<BOS> You find yourself dragged once more, out through a burnt hall and rubble, through the skeleton of a half destroyed complex to a room beneath what was once the Mage Academy. There are another dozen mages here, sitting solemnly on a drawn circle on the floor. You are placed in the design in the center, and find you cannot move. <EOS>
<BOS> However, the captain isn’t exactly eager to risk his own life this day. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? You can’t seriously be considering recruiting MORE hobs.” <EOS>
<BOS> “A room? Thought you were living in the Guild quarters ever since they let you into inner circle.” Bruno says. <EOS>
<BOS> "So. What would the son of my old employer want with me?" Wendy asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I just sort of got lost trying to hide from the bloodshed and before I knew it there was an explosion and I woke up here. Now I don’t know where my sister is and I fear the worst…(sob).” You say really trying to put on the tears by rubbing your eyes a lot. <EOS>
<BOS> “You giving me lip boy? I’m asking the questions here! We don’t need anymore scum like you in this city!” the guard says and pushes you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. I didn’t think to check the basement.” <EOS>
<BOS> You have to admit, after all the times you’ve fantasized and dreamed about these encounters, none of them ever were like this. <EOS>
<BOS> “Here we are,” he utters, more to himself than you. A single rope hangs down in front of you. Looking up, you see a glimpse of a round opening way above you. It must be at least twice as high as the monastery’s walls. <EOS>
<BOS> “You don’t think that we’ve angered a god by thwarting his plans?” <EOS>
<BOS> As you watch her walk away, some guilt wells up inside you. You’re going to kill this girl and you just don’t have the willpower to stop yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s no use though, you had quite a few of those drinks and the urge is overwhelming. Since it isn’t going away anytime soon, you do the only thing you can think of… <EOS>
<BOS> “I know these woods better than anyone. I’ll draw as many as I can from the camp. You two play clean up. Sound good?” Richard says. <EOS>
<BOS> So that’s why she’s leaving. As for telling you, she said she went back and forth on whether or not if she should since even though you weren’t together any more, she got the impression that you might be inclined to talk her out of leaving. Running into you when she did and your reaction to her advances sort of solved that personal dilemma though. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well the Ebony Claw had heard of the Talons and their problems with Klyton’s improved security. However, they also knew of our reputation even if it was a bit tattered at that point. Out of respect, they offered to help the Talons. The deal was we’d still have reign over Klyton, keep our identity and have to access to Ebony Claw resources, but we’d have to give a cut of all the profits we made to them. Not sure what the percentage was, but Edmond wasn’t pleased with it. Though like I said, it could have been free and he probably would have turned them down.” <EOS>
<BOS> “(Sigh) No. But I’m wondering how she did it exactly. I just don’t see her as a natural killer and Camid wasn’t a push over…wait a minute. Sonofabitch. She used the little green bastards! They follow everything she says. They’re also small and sneaky enough to dig some little passage that only they could get in and then. You said Camid had large holes all over his body. Probably from pick axes.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Dr. Gossey comes back with a pouch full of coins. <EOS>
<BOS> “The Blackheart? Nah. Totally destroyed. I think there’s a new weapon shop there now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I said SHUT IT!” the same guard says and trots his horse next to the side of the cart and hits you in the head with a small cudgel causing you to fall off your seat and onto the cart floor. The other man in cuffs just watches you as you attempt to get up. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t you turn your back on me, and this is for punching me in the fucking face!” Tanya says and kicks you hard in the balls. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah turns and walks off. You watch her and follow her a bit until you see her catch a carriage. <EOS>
<BOS> Horses are far cheaper to rent than to buy, merely 20 silver for two of them for a half-day, and so a couple of hours later the two of you are riding across the plains towards Lantern forest. Once you reach the edge, you take off the women's outer kirtle and headscarf and put on your new garments before continuing. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point you empty your pockets and coin pouch of some of the gold you took from the Blue Dream House and dump in all on the floor. <EOS>
<BOS> To the elephant he gave a challenge, a contest of strength lifting branches, which the elephant easily won. But while the elephant paraded her victory, the snake took the piece dropped from her trunk. <EOS>
<BOS> You run at the orc with your dagger in hand and manage to get it to the ground in its weakened state. You stab it in the back multiple times and don’t stop until the woman calls out to you. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera becomes concerned about you and tells you that you need to relax even if the situation isn’t ideal because the last thing the Nocturnal League needs right now is an unstable leader. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not working on your turf obviously. I’m not doing anything except…going off with this whore.” You say <EOS>
<BOS> You leave the Welcome Mat Inn, though a little more cautiously than usual. Nobody seems to be approaching or giving you suspicious looks though. Still, wishing to keep a low profile, you stick to the back streets as much as possible and eventually when you get to the better part of town, you catch a coach for your remaining trip to the university. By the time you arrive, the day is beginning to end, but you soon find that the university is still fairly active. <EOS>
<BOS> Your arms are put behind your back and iron shackles are placed on your wrists. When you’re marched down the stairs and in front of various inn onlookers, you hear Ren complain about them breaking his door, to which the one that was talking to you earlier remarks that Ren’s lucky that they aren’t taking him in and shutting this whole place down. <EOS>
<BOS> “What the fuck did they put in the damn drinks, ground up unicorn testicles?” you mutter. <EOS>
<BOS> Granted this hasn’t been the best month, but you swear you thought you’d be doing a lot better than this by now. This city unfortunately though is proving a lot more vigilant than you’d like. You certainly aren’t in Teckleville anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay. Fine. Consider this a pardon from the Syndicate. You are free to leave, but what you won’t be doing is running the Nocturnal League from Jicol. As far as the Syndicate is concerned, the Nocturnal League is just a tool for us to use as we see fit. We’ll get someone else to run it. Maybe your second in command will be more receptive, we were thinking about contacting her anyway. She was an ex-Claw after all.” <EOS>
<BOS> Gloom tells you that he’ll organize an attack in a few days, you tell him that works for you since you have some other business to attend to. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that’s still a problem since it’s still not progress, it’s just keeping the status quo.” <EOS>
<BOS> With things also starting to get restless in Jicol, you don’t really have much choice but to ease up on the restrictions. One way or another he’s probably getting off the island if he hasn’t already and you’ll just have to be prepared quicker. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe you just weren’t meant to have an average girlfriend, let alone an average relationship. Makes sense given that you don’t lead an average life either. <EOS>
<BOS> Brand new city. Brand new life. You’ve done it before, now you’ll have to see if you can do it again. <EOS>
<BOS> The tracks lead in the general direction of sieging army, but then suddenly move east. You stoop down to examine a smudge in the lightly grassend forest floor. A bootprint; a man's boot, obviously, but the angle of the print is what alerts you. It looks like someone squashed a bug. More likely, the result of a pivot. The deepness of the print shows it was made with a fast moving foot or the boot-wearer was carrying several hundred pounds of weight. You assume it's the former. Then, you see it. Blood. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s enough! I’m mayor of this damn town and this is my decision which I haven’t even got to yet! My verdict is guilty BUT I’m not giving this young man death. It was an accident and despite everything I’ve said, I personally wouldn’t feel comfortable with myself executing a youth who made a very bad mistake. However, he can’t stay here. So my final decision is exile as of tomorrow. You come back and you WILL be executed, you understand?” the mayor says. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re in a much weaker position now, but you imagine that you can hopefully bounce back from it. You just need time. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, and shhh. Don’t make a scene. I’m not here to cause problems.” <EOS>
<BOS> Another has a bad infection in a cut on his leg. You drain it, wash it, and ask Spryce to heat a dagger so you can lance it. There is nothing to numb him, just a stick he can bite on, but it's necessary if he wants to keep the leg. <EOS>
<BOS> "Please!" you ask through the scarf, "there's an ash storm. I can't stay out here." <EOS>
<BOS> “I hardly think some bums are going to be a concern, and so some of the gang carried you home, big deal. It’s not like you got the shit kicked out of you. You just passed out from a mixture of alcohol and wild sex. In fact I went on about how you were giving it to me really good last night. If anything your reputation just increased a bit. Even better, because I wasn’t even lying.” Vera remarks and moves in to caress your body. <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve always hated the wilderness. You still have the bad memories of when you had to trounce about the forests on your way to Holgard. It’s so easy to get lost, especially at night. Better to stay in a structure until day break when you can at least see better. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hmm, do you talk to him back?” <EOS>
<BOS> Where you would go though, you aren’t sure. You’re going to have to figure it out. <EOS>
<BOS> Mad Merodatch must have gotten to the book somehow and broken its seals to unleash its power on the village. Once the seals were broken, I was immediately able to sense the power of that dark book; but by then it was too late for the village.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Garrick sent me on a mission to kill Reginald.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait, so are you saying we have to be fucking during this spell?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> The company strides into the castle’s interior. Several gaps in the walls allow you to see the forest surrounding the structure. An entire tower lays shattered on the ground, its stone blocks spread out like a fortune teller’s seeing bones. The overgrown grass rises to your mid-thigh making the journey slow as you scan the ground for buried stones, but more importantly, traps. The main door to the castle has far deteriorated past usefulness, leaving the entrance wide open. Seeing as there is not another way in, you enter the ruins. <EOS>
<BOS> It’s a side effect of the ritual. The blood of the hellspawn wants to control the host. It wants to feed, and left unchecked, it will consume the host in a neverending blood rage. Some urges are stronger than others. I’m sure by your age you know that by now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh?” <EOS>
<BOS> He's an amiable enough bunkmate though, and the week passes without incident. You even find some part-time work in the galley washing dishes, which helps replenish your purse a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> “My proposal is this. WE ally against the Felians. They aren’t going to expect an attack from you and you probably know when and where best to strike. We will provide back up of course to minimize the losses. In return you get allies that are much more powerful in the ways of magic and aren’t likely to backstab you in the future. Our goal aren’t the same, but don’t conflict either, so I’d say that already makes us better than the Felians.” <EOS>
<BOS> "My name is on the deed!" <EOS>
<BOS> You look up to see members of the company staring down through hole in the floor where Seth and you fell. The spell that affected their mind is gone, and they watch you with interest. Lorthander brings his staff to Seth’s legs. Green wisps swirl around the gnarled staff, lingering for a moment, and then they project into Seth’s legs, repairing and strengthening bone and muscle. Seth bends his knees, testing the strength and then rises, still kicking his feet. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Looks that way.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “More company, Richard?” she sighs. “At least this one’s walking.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh fuck off! You do not! You have gone out of your way several times to make it quite clear that you are NOT interested in me. You’re just telling me this shit so I’ll join you again and now I’m fucking insulted that you think so low of me that I’ll follow you around like some love sick admirer.” <EOS>
<BOS> As you walk into the village, all the villagers turn at once and wail mournfully at your presence. In horror, you see that they are all withered-looking husks and that they open their jaws wide, as they stagger towards you hungrily. <EOS>
<BOS> The weeks pass in this way. Every day there are at least four or five people to treat, and sometimes in the middle of the night you wake to screams, only to be taken to stitch up a new 'patient' who has been mutilated somehow - the strangest being the young woman missing a leg, whom you had to tourniquet. Every time there is a mage there, someone holding a glowing boxor trunk, who mysteriously departs at the next port. Worse, still, are the nights where you hear screams but Spryce doesn't take you to them. You dutifully pretend to be asleep, but inevitably there comes a large splash, as if something heavy has been dropped into the sea. <EOS>
<BOS> After a bit of suspicion and getting over some trust issues (Which you still have concerning him) you agreed and he’s been taking all your business. You aren’t sure who he’s selling your stolen goods to and he’s probably taking a little more than he should, but it’s worth it just so you don’t have to worry about selling the stuff yourself or seeking one out and having to get involved with one of the major factions in the city. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s a secret door, maybe he didn’t anticipate anyone finding it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Another reason you’re getting to stay here.” <EOS>
<BOS> They take you to a large building with many rooms, where other men and women wander the halls in a daze or rock to themselves in their chambers. Some are old, like yourself. Some are even older. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t know too much about Galpatis except shit that your sister sometimes spoke about from some book she read. It was supposed to be a great empire thousands of years ago that destroyed itself as all these ancient civilizations tend to do for whatever reason. Probably had something to do with necromancy or something. <EOS>
<BOS> However, he’s quick enough to avoid her attacks. <EOS>
<BOS> “That shit doesn’t matter with Jake, you know that. He’ll just be looking for an excuse to cut your throat. In fact, I think you’ve got the right idea sending Zal to speak with him, but I don’t think you should be there at all.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course, but I’ll be damned if I’m going to part with my shit to pay the damn ECS. I’m sure you’d feel the same way about your stash.” <EOS>
<BOS> It didn’t start off as violent as its become, but its been bad enough that the Holgard Watch has been more focused on breaking up fights between religious factions and members in the streets than keeping an eye on crime and happily, the Holgard Watch has slowly started to revert back to their corrupt ways. Not enough like the old days, but enough that they aren’t as much of a problem anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> “Or you’ll what?” <EOS>
<BOS> You never saw this coming. And despite Vera’s comments, she didn’t either, or at least not what she assumed. She was so busy worrying that Warts and the hobs were going to fuck you over that she didn’t take into consideration that their recklessness and stupidity is what drew more attention by the government, though you think you played a large part in that same stupidity by NOT keeping a better eye on things and just leaving it all to Warts. <EOS>
<BOS> “STOP HIDING BEHIND YER MAMA’S SKIRT AND GET OUT HERE MURDERER!” you hear a voice shout. <EOS>
<BOS> He went first to the peacock, who was sunning on a rock. "I hear you have a magnificent tail," the serpent said, "the most dazzling of all creatures. I only have dull brown scales, myself. Would you fan your tail for me, that I might gaze upon this wonder?" <EOS>
<BOS> Hell of a way to go, but given you didn’t think it was a great idea anyway, you’re glad you decided not to go with her. <EOS>
<BOS> “But…it had to be you…I mean…wasn’t it?” <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t know how long you’re out for, but when you wake up you’re by yourself and there is no sign of the woman you were with. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well his magic couldn’t stop a bullet. You okay?” <EOS>
<BOS> “In any case, as I said speak with her yourself and if you still don’t think she’s a suitable sitter then we can sell her ass. Anyway tell me about your meeting with the ECS afterwards, I’ll be free soon. Just have to check on one more slave shipment.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Interesting, that wasn't a denial." Zal remarks with a smirk. <EOS>
<BOS> “True, but you’re forgetting that I also brought down the ECS in Holgard.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I better be otherwise mom’s got some explaining to do!” your sister says with a smile. <EOS>
<BOS> “Someone needs to tell him something! As I remember it was me who told him to start changing shit up last time too.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes. I really do believe that and I gave my reasons already.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Uh oh. You sound like mom. Which means this doesn’t sound good.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good. Now enjoy yourself. I have to handle a few Imperial matters, but I’ll be back soon. Make yourself comfortable. I can tell that you and I are going to get along nicely, Mira,” the Captain says, smiling, and getting from his chair. He pours the remainder of his cup into Mira’s. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t even reply, you just continue strangling her. Vera now is fighting for her life, but despite kneeing you in the crotch several times, you’re not even fazed. Even your desire for sex has been muted over your desire to kill her. <EOS>
<BOS> “More or less. You guys always fall a bit short, but at least I wasn’t dealing with Jake’s whiskey dick this time around. Thanks for asking though at least.” <EOS>
<BOS> You feel the crunch of your nose breaking as you fall to the ground. You then feel a boot to the side of your head nearly knocking you unconscious. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re soaked, you’re cold, and you’re exhausted. You lost your pack during your time in the river and you have no idea where you are now, but you’re too tired to care. You lie motionless on the muddy bank you’re on for a moment just trying to gather yourself, but as they say, no rest for the wicked. <EOS>
<BOS> At least that’s the general idea. <EOS>
<BOS> The surrounding area outside the museum, the place is more or less empty. There aren’t too many other people in the area other than a few Holgard Watchmen patrolling around which you keep clear of. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh come on! This is bullshit! I’m a fucking registered citizen of Hessla you can’t fucking rob me!” a voice says. Sounds like the trader. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, of course! Who would I even tell? I don’t even understand what exactly is going on.” Layla remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look! I don’t know what the hell your game is, but I’m not playing, and I’m not fooled!” <EOS>
<BOS> Probably wouldn’t be enough to stop them if they really wanted to kill you, but along with all your more mundane security, it’s enough to give them pause if they tried. However if that were the intent, you probably wouldn’t be having a conversation at all. <EOS>
<BOS> By afternoon, a small crowd had gathered to watch, amused to see the horses playing. Rom allowed them to take turns playing the emperor, and to feed the winners. <EOS>
<BOS> Heather’s look of hopefulness drops. <EOS>
<BOS> After spending more fun time with Zalmora, you do eventually get around to speaking with Tom and just like Zal predicted, he’s actually receptive to your ideas. He says that it probably would be better to start reigning in the loot and pillage tactics in the city. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey kid.” Mr. Scars says. <EOS>
<BOS> The serpent lay in the grass for hours, watching the lion stalk his prey. The lion, knowing he had an audience, ,made a great show of it when he finally pounced on a young rhino. But the serpent wasn't watching his display - he was busy collecting the piece that fell from the lion's mane. <EOS>
<BOS> “I know you’re the boss and all, but I have to say, sometimes you’re a very poor liar. But, whatever just as long as you’re not chopping my head off to make a point I guess.” <EOS>
<BOS> At this point the excitement still hasn’t subsided, and you still don’t think you’d make it outside. And if you bumped into Vera on the way, well you’d definitely be taking her up on all those blowjobs she’s offered you in the past. (In fact you were thinking about her the second time around) <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah, probably not. I just don’t know though. I mean how do I know if your feelings are real for me, or if it’s all just infernal magic? How do I know that my feelings for you are genuine or if I’m just luring you in and going to just suck out your soul eventually?” <EOS>
<BOS> Still seems a bit surreal that you killed someone. Not just anyone, but someone you knew since childhood, even if you didn’t like him. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh and I suppose our protection rackets and our Purple Wish dens are great contributions to society as well.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, I'm sure Edmond thought the same thing once." <EOS>
<BOS> You manage to stand up, but you doubt if you’re going to be much match for Tanya. Even if you weren’t naked and unarmed, you probably wouldn’t be a match. <EOS>
<BOS> Camid looks a bit confused at first since he probably thought he was going to be involved in someway, but after waving him away he gets the message leaving you alone with Madeline. <EOS>
<BOS> "Thank you, mistress," the stableman bowed. And though he did not obtain the position he'd initially desired, he was glad! To be the horsemaster of the games was everything he truly wanted. <EOS>
<BOS> Hank fumbles to get the bag a couple times, but eventually he does. He then says something about you know where his safe is and just take the money from there, before he shoves the pills in his mouth. <EOS>
<BOS> “If you REALLY loved me as much as you claim, you would have! Do you realize how hard it is for me to ignore my feelings for you? Why do you think I look like a soldier of war rather than a seductress now? I tried to eliminate everything and anything that even reminded me of intimacy. I had to fight and struggle not only to block you out of my mind and the weakness that entailed with it, but also endure the taunts and challenges of other infernals who refused to see me as anything other than a succubus with human blood in my veins.” <EOS>
<BOS> “HEY! STOP! Stop you fucking asshole!” she replies dodging apples. <EOS>
<BOS> The only business you left in the sewers was the Yellow Devil Den. Seemed fairly pointless to befoul your new locations with it and it’s users. Better it should stay in the sewers. <EOS>
<BOS> “Here, but hurry the hell up I’m not sticking around here any longer than I have to.” <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s true too.” Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> Taking a politer approach you explain everything or rather you spin your lie which isn’t completely a lie since the two Dreams were pair of loudmouth assholes that blabbed shit so freely that’s what allowed you to relay most inside information to Tanya in the first place. <EOS>
<BOS> “Or somehow hatch a litter of wyverns,” Richard jokes. <EOS>
<BOS> “I can snatch malcontents off the streets all I want or even send assassins out, but it’s never going to be enough for Ludmilla. She really wants to be safe and your magic spells greatly enhance that.” <EOS>
<BOS> "We know!" The Head Mage snaps his fingers. "Lorvan, arrange for all the water you can. Silon, take charge of the evacuation. Brokolis, start making a portal to Pefallis." <EOS>
<BOS> Life is hard enough without constant physical stress. Each time those thoughts would rise, I would force myself back to my practice, back to my true being. The fact is, those thoughts were born of my lesser, weak-willed nature. My training is meant to suppress the weakness inside. <EOS>
<BOS> You show Dr. Gossey who looks into the box. <EOS>
<BOS> "Everyone's gotta start somewhere, besides we're not really being picky right now. Had a big loss recently and we need all the help we can get." <EOS>
<BOS> While there may be more Joachimites than Felians, you know there aren’t more of them than the Nocturnal League. It’ll just be a matter of keeping up the pressure and whittling them down. Eventually there won’t be enough of them to defend this Inquisitor properly and that’s when you’ll make the killing strike. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because I went to so much damn effort to keep her in power and ally with her, it seems pretty counter productive to just kill her now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh you’re going to die, but not in a few years and certainly not of a broken heart.” <EOS>
<BOS> A few days pass and several of the pirates, merchants, slavers and sailors begin to protest that you won’t let them leave the island, but in order to somewhat alleviate their complaints you wave any costs they might have. This helps somewhat, but many of them still aren’t very happy. The slavers especially since they feel like they’re being held captive and of course they know all about doing that to others. <EOS>
<BOS> Annah rolls her eyes. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well that’s presumptuous that we’re going to get the shit kicked out of us. As long as we don’t stand toe to toe with an invading force and stay out of the damn way, I imagine we’ll get through it. Hell, it isn’t like we don’t have routes out of the city if need be. Honestly though unless this Peter is bringing the full force of the Delantium army, I don’t see him winning. Ludmilla counts wizards among her allies and has a strong fleet of her own, so I question if this Peter is even going to succeed. And say Peter does win, then what? Is this guy some law and order fanatic? He’s a Varsakken and from what I can tell every single one of their family members are corrupt. So it would just be a matter of coming to an understanding with him so business continues as usual.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well tearing down everything you had built before you died was only part of it. The next part was supposed to be the stinger, but it wasn’t anticipated that you’d actually STAY in this forsaken city and fight to the bitter end rather than run off to Jicol. And it certainly wasn’t anticipated that you’d move up in status. After it was all said and done the ECS leadership decided everything evened out and they washed their hands of it. You were out of their hair as far as business competition anymore.” <EOS>
<BOS> Seth leads you back through the hallways, although in the opposite direction of the courtyard. After a series of twists and turns you end up in the meditation sanctuary. Rows of mats line the open room. A sizeable shrine sits in the center, covered with religious trinkets and sacred flowers. There are no signs of the battle here. Seth walks up to the shrine and examines it. <EOS>
<BOS> "And you will not leave me again?" <EOS>
<BOS> You hear the name Zamed and your immediately sit up and accidently hit your head, cursing in the process. <EOS>
<BOS> “WHAT?! I did no such thing!” Annah exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> Part of you wonders if maybe you should just move on from this city, but you really loathe the idea of travelling again and you aren’t sure where you’d go. Hessla maybe? <EOS>
<BOS> “Who else would it be? They’re the ones who mostly smuggle and deal this stuff.” <EOS>
<BOS> With that last cold response of a man who was determined to take away everything important to you, your vision goes dark. <EOS>
<BOS> “I imagine he is now. He’s wanted my father’s business and fortune for years. With everyone dead, and me stuck here, he’s next in line to get everything.” <EOS>
<BOS> None of the stress of dealing with day to day shit of running an entire criminal organization. <EOS>
<BOS> “I hope this isn’t a possible invasion. We saw another one a few months ago, though he was much smaller and ran off when he saw us. He was nowhere near as big as this one.” The woman remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t want to even get into it right now, I’ll tell you another time, I just want to go rest.” <EOS>
<BOS> Year 30 <EOS>
<BOS> The jeweled crown is what really catches your eye. The regular jewelry is going to bring a nice price of course, but that crown isn’t like something you’ve ever stolen before. <EOS>
<BOS> Sleep doesn't come easily, especially this early in the evening, so you eat a biscuit from your pack and lay back, tracing the warped woodgrain of the bed above you with your eyes. You wonder how far the plank has traveled, and how many people have worn it down. <EOS>
<BOS> Dozens of orc and human mercs go down by magical means be it fire, lightning, frost, or even giant weasel. (Somehow one of the Heather’s people summoned giant hostile weasel in the middle of the battle area, certainly was an unexpected sight) <EOS>
<BOS> You imagine you could get the time to leave though if you wanted. <EOS>
<BOS> While you have your concerns about Rob, he seems the most affordable, accessible and most importantly, at your mercy. The dwarf you just know is going to ask for a shitload of money and the girl is just a wild child university student. Who knows what kind of chaos that will invite? <EOS>
<BOS> You follow him through the castle hallways, tip-toeing, moving as quiet as dozens of men can. The south end of the castle faces sheer mountainside. Your way out isn’t really a way out; it’s more like a fool’s errand and Seth confidently writes it at the top of his “to do” list. One of the men with you has knowledge of various traps along the way and disables them with ease. The “window” looks more like an empty doorway. If not for the deadly traps along the way, you’d think the opening to be an accident waiting to happen. <EOS>
<BOS> A month passes and Marco and his crew are about as ready as they’re going to be and your spies that have been sneaking in and out of Jicol, have made steps in opening the gates along with just creating as much havoc for ground forces as possible during the actual attack. <EOS>
<BOS> A lot of folks are just planning to go find Jake and follow him instead, a few have just mentioned going independent. Still others have mentioned maybe it’s time for new leadership within the Crimson Talons. <EOS>
<BOS> Bruno, the innkeeper nods when he sees you. Funny how you never really learned his name until after you stopped living here on a regular basis. <EOS>
<BOS> You found the inner strength to carry on by learning the language, the surroundings and everything else you could. It’s quite the accomplishment really. Unfortunately the only thing you haven’t learned is how to get back home. <EOS>
<BOS> Teklis laughs as he puts his satchel on a table and pulling out objects. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, you’re right about that as well. I wasn’t a member when they still had the fighting pits, but I do remember seeing a few when my dad bet on them. Even as a little girl I knew I liked seeing two big guys get all sweaty and bloody, beating the shit out of each other. I know there are the Klyton gladiators, but they wear so much damn armor that they barely get hurt and it’s very rare to see a fatality. Pretty sure it’s all fixed anyway. The Klyton Council probably makes a shitload of money off that racket. Too bad we aren’t politicians.” Zalmora says. <EOS>
<BOS> As you sit counting your ill-gotten loot from the latest traveling merchant in town, your girlfriend is watching you with an exasperated expression. Of course she tends to look like that a lot. <EOS>
<BOS> "Glad to hear it. So, we're going to need miners and equipment which is the easy part, but we're also going to need a genuine engineer so the whole damn thing doesn't fall on our heads. So anyone know of any?" You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> One of the members however is standing back and still blinking in and out of existence. He’s obviously using that blasted shadow magic. He’s mainly giving orders right now, but if he gets in the fight, you don’t anticipate things going well. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey, you. You see any more Guild members run this way?” he asks. <EOS>
<BOS> The female Claw member who was talking to you before now looks a little more concerned by your presence and starts going for her weapon. <EOS>
<BOS> "This is true," the eagle said. <EOS>
<BOS> You look at your full coin pouch and ponder your next move. <EOS>
<BOS> Zal doesn't say another word she just turns away in a huff. <EOS>
<BOS> At least there was a little dignity after all. <EOS>
<BOS> They take you to a large building with many rooms, where other men and women wander the halls in a daze or rock to themselves in their chambers. Some are old, like yourself. Some are even older. <EOS>
<BOS> Cut off the head and the rest is going to follow. <EOS>
<BOS> “Another unsuccessful breach!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh no. None of that. Well at least not yet since I don’t know how back this curse you say is. Now I know you went over some of it your condition in your letter, but I get the impression you didn’t tell me everything and I’m going to need to know everything if I’m going to properly help you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I was thinking more of a stealthy assassination.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, well whatever works I say. Your service here will not be forgotten whatever your reasons may be. You can be assured that this government’s relationship with your organization will continue to be a positive one after all this is finally over.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What you’re going to do is lead me out of this here forest for free or you get a hole in you bigger than one of your nostrils.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re naked and you’ve got one dead man on top of you and you’re currently rubbing up against another one trying kill you, if someone had told you that you’d ever be in this situation you never would have believed it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah the bar, I’ll just help myself if you don’t mind.” Vera says pouring herself a drink. <EOS>
<BOS> After you answer them, you ask, "tell me, what other things besides horses does the Empress like?" <EOS>
<BOS> As far as your involvement, you’re going to take a lesson from the last time you led one of these attacks. Meaning you’re not going to put yourself on the front lines and going to stay at a camp a mile away from Jicol’s gates. <EOS>
<BOS> "I sure wouldn't be stupid enough to stick around as long as this one did." <EOS>
<BOS> You manage to finally get one of your arms free, but it’s a little late since now part of your own flesh is in flames. Punching Heather in the face a few times only results in her instinctively retaliating with blast of lightning to YOUR face. <EOS>
<BOS> “What’s to know? You’re obviously still holding a candle for her like a fucking idiot. You think she gives a shit about you? No. She was a DEMON. They don’t give a shit about anything! And here you are still being faithful for a girl that isn’t around meanwhile you outright continue to ignore people who ARE here and do care for you. Someone who knows your likes and dislikes. Someone who has done more than she would normally do and would probably do a lot more stupid shit because for some fucked up reason she really likes you.” <EOS>
<BOS> Your sleep is suddenly awakened by a lot of screaming and yelling, a gunshot and then the carriage smashing into something and flipping on its side. You and the couple go tumbling all over the carriage. <EOS>
<BOS> Four stories and 85 silver later, the librarians finally realize something is going on and come to see why everyone is still crowded in the story area. They don't stop you, but watch during the fifth and wait until after you pocket another 28 silver to approach. <EOS>
<BOS> “I was your first kiss too?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Y’know you could leave too. I mean not with me of course, but you’re a resourceful guy, I’m sure you could make it outside this one horse town too. You did say you get bored here.” Your sister says. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m crushed. But good, I don’t want to look too out of place at Madeline’s graduation.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh well money’s certainly nice, but I don’t really need any. I do however need ingredients for my potions. Lots of useful stuff out in the jungle, but I don’t get out much anymore, especially with this place being half submerged nowadays. I got a garden, but just can’t grow certain things in these conditions you know?” <EOS>
<BOS> "I don't expect you to risk yourself," you say, "but could you show me? I feel like there will be answers there, like I need to go." <EOS>
<BOS> “So is he open now?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, Revenge tends make people a little reckless and I mean this has been sort of personal since you learned who the leader of JCR is.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Most lovely! Superb! The descriptions pale in comparison!" The serpent plied the peacock with flattery, and the peacock preened and puffed. It did not see the map piece fall from its tail, nor the prehensile tail that snatched it up. <EOS>
<BOS> Heather looks at you with a mixture of anticipation and hopefulness. Perhaps even a bit of desperation. The fact that she’s asking you at all says to you that she’s not exactly confident that she’ll win without your help. <EOS>
<BOS> "Natural talent, boss. All he needed was the confidence boost. I guarantee he'll be able to build that underground city better than any dwarf could or Klyton university egghead with an over priced edu..." Vaughn starts to say and then suddenly the beam that Rob is leaning against cracks. <EOS>
<BOS> “I do not believe that will happen. You are allied with the Felians are you not?” <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you finally evade the law and it’s just you and Vera panting heavily ankle deep in shit water. She immediately starts bitching at you about your bad choices while you’re attempting to figure out your next move. <EOS>
<BOS> Warts gets slightly more talkative as you walk to your destination. He mentions that the Thieves Guild has their hideout somewhere down here, but he doesn’t know where. Neither does the ECS, since they’d probably mount an attack if they could. <EOS>
<BOS> Brother Samuel lifts the mug to his mouth only to discover the contents empty. <EOS>
<BOS> Eventually you get to a part of the sewer that seems familiar from the last time you were here and you make your way back up. <EOS>
<BOS> Dreaming! You haven't had a dream in decades. No one has. Why are you dreaming now? <EOS>
<BOS> Hobs, never being the subtlest ended up unwittingly showing the Baroness where the hell your secret tunnels to the city were and practically to your front fucking doorstep as they were dragging goods back. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, give me the good since I haven’t had much of that lately.” <EOS>
<BOS> Before he can even get off of it, the beam breaks and he falls to the ground as the rest of the beam falls on him, followed by parts of the ceiling. <EOS>
<BOS> You pull away the cloth and look at the injury. Deliberate, as you feared. It seems something has been cut out of him, perhaps a kidney, and none too cleanly. Everything is oozing and burbling. You replace the fabric and help him put pressure on the wound. <EOS>
<BOS> “I heard fighting and wanted to help, but you insisted I stay here.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> “WHAT?! Grand Matriarch you can’t mean that!” Gwen answers. <EOS>
<BOS> Since dreams were lost thirty years ago in the Sacrifice of Salvation, there is little attraction left for you in sleeping late. You wake with the sun - earlier, in winter, - and generally spend your mornings laying out in the dewy grass, staring up at the light shimmering over the leaves of the forest canopy, or trying to count how many different sounds you can hear.  Sometimes, you bring out miniature, carved palaces and hang them, then sit a while watching the hummingbirds squabble over the thrones of seed and the fountains of nectar. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re saying a shaman gave you battle plans? I thought you Imperials were more distrusting than that.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright, we can stay a little longer, but I’m going to find someplace away from most of these people. You can do what you like. I’ll come looking for you in a while I guess.” <EOS>
<BOS> Mira does as she’s commanded. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera lets herself out and you’re breathing a sigh of relief that you didn’t give in since you’re fairly certain you would have, had Vera not left when she did. <EOS>
<BOS> “If you created it, perhaps you can cure it,” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> The Emperor grabs for the amulet at his neck, and even though its been decades, you recognize it. The Grandmaster’s amulet. At the same time, the Emperor’s wyvern jumps into the air, flapping its leathery wings. You’re taken higher in the air. Wind rushes into your face, stinging your eyes, drying them with the sudden burst. Down below, the clashing armies are but insects, two waves of color molding into one. The Unbroken raises a palm and clamps your fist shut. <EOS>
<BOS> “Knew you weren’t shit. Good luck picking a lock with one good hand for awhile!” Jake says and begins walking away. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I’ve chosen not to go by any silly ego driven titles, I’m just me. I already had a talk with my son about that. You can meet him later, he’s busy with his lessons right now. I’m sure he’ll be thrilled to show his aunt his magic skills.” <EOS>
<BOS> “The floor? You’re not sleeping on the floor either. This is MY room. You want a room here, you pay for it yourself!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya, I’m serious. This is a really BAD idea, assaulting Rook’s home by yourself. I mean don’t you even at least have those cultists you can send, or maybe someone else?” <EOS>
<BOS> Hopefully this will give you some sort of taste of what I felt that night and if not, well at least I got your loot. <EOS>
<BOS> “Right here in this dirty ass alley?” <EOS>
<BOS> You can't think of anything else to do so you start singing various bawdy songs you've heard over the years at the top of your lungs as you row for your life. <EOS>
<BOS> As much as you look up to Seth, King Aeric holds ultimate authority. You decide to wait for the King’s command instead of joining the rogue raiding party. Besides, King Aeric was going to decide in the morning. You hope Seth holds out for a least one more night, but you’re doubtful. Once his mind is made up, there’s not a thing anyone can do. Alone in the training grounds, you begin to flow through your forms. You lose yourself in the practice until nightfall. <EOS>
<BOS> “Cuz I got Yag wit me always. Sides, it’s usually more profitable than working with the Spider Fangs nowadays. Idjits too busy warring with da elves rather than simple banditry. Not hangin’ around for dat.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Well, then. We have an understanding. You'll work for us in a more - specialized capacity. You get to fix all the sick people you want, be a hero if you like. But you'll get off when I say you get off, and you'll keep mum about the things you see. I pay you want I feel like paying. You talk to no one save Spryce, Sabry, and myself. Agreed?" <EOS>
<BOS> “The fuckers are in there and…SHIT!” <EOS>
<BOS> "It's time," you sigh, and return inside your simple wooden cabin to finish packing. Today you are to begin a pilgrimage that will take you thousands of farspans north, across the equator and beyond, to the sacred Grove of Muses. It is there your wife stands as stone, along with the other muses who gave their lives to save the planet. All except Sandman, who was all but destroyed, and now orbits the planet as a ring of glittering dust. Now, instead of giving special dreams, all dreams return to him. <EOS>
<BOS> When you finally board the Traveller, Zamed greets you and shows you to where you’ll be staying on his ship. <EOS>
<BOS> “Whoa there son, I’m not going to do anything! If anything I’m going to be your best friend for life if you set me free. Look I’ll even step as far back as I can in this cage and put my hands behind my back while you pick the lock!” <EOS>
<BOS> "It's just...well do you think this is even feasible?" Zal asks. <EOS>
<BOS> As you head back to your room, you ponder who he could have been talking about. Your dad? Dad’s not a big guy though and you honestly doubt if he would bother to come look for you. <EOS>
<BOS> “So you think I should make a deal with this Peter Varsakken?” <EOS>
<BOS> The only thing going through your mind during this is that you’d probably be better off not allying with Peter. Even if Heather is receptive to the idea of switching sides, it’s still no safety guarantee for you. <EOS>
<BOS> “So you said something about solving my money problems?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> It comes again, harder this time. You lower the mental defenses that you’ve spent a lifetime building up. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes! This is my fucking room! Checkers attack!” Annah commands and you feel her fluffy hound viciously bite you on the ankle. <EOS>
<BOS> Days pass and eventually the time has come for you to convince everyone that they need to join you. You aren’t sure if it’s going to be entirely successful, but hopefully you can convince most of them if only to mount an assault on the slavers. <EOS>
<BOS> “Come with you? To Arcanius?” <EOS>
<BOS> “You didn’t seem to have any objections before when your dick was in my mouth.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, Warts likes to play the role of a freelance outsider, mainly because he’s been doing it for so long he’s comfortable in that role. Nevermind the fact that deep down inside he wants to be part of a tribe. And that’s us, though he’ll never admit that, right Warts?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya looks down at you and even in your hazy condition you no longer see any glimpse of the girl you knew in her eyes any longer. All that remains is a beast out for blood. <EOS>
<BOS> “It is?” <EOS>
<BOS> You gather up a bunch of broken branches, break out your tinderbox and begin fumbling around with the flint <EOS>
<BOS> Klint as usual is slow on the uptake and doesn’t even get the double meaning insult you just said, but he’s mad at you anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, hope I don’t miss her.” <EOS>
<BOS> Humans were the fodder of this battle, forced to choose sides without fully understanding the stakes. One of these soldiers was Niro, a curious young man conscripted by the mages, sent with his battalion to seek and destroy the First Court of the Muses. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay. I think you killed it.” She shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ambush. The king’s men were caught unawares.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well maybe another time…so we’re good I trust?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay then if you insist.” <EOS>
<BOS> You run through a gamut of thoughts and emotions just thinking about all this. In between the thinking you keep kicking yourself for stealing that fucking crown. It warned you and you didn’t listen. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not sure what you lot are arguing about, all this shit is going to me first, especially since I was the one who disarmed most of these traps in the first place. In any event we can probably get a good price for most of this stuff and the League could always use more coin in the general treasury.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> "It doesn't, but if someone like me noticed you were doing it, I'm sure others have too. Now I know this place has a certain reputation, but punishment for thievery in this town is pretty damn severe. We might mostly be cutthroats and vagabonds here, but we don't shit where we eat. We all have to live here with a certain measure of trust. If we don't, well the whole place goes to shit now doesn't it?" <EOS>
<BOS> When you get back to the League Lair, Vera looks like she’s relieved that you made it back. You guess she was still sort of overwhelmed by the idea that she might be running things. <EOS>
<BOS> “Let’s not dwell on the past any more okay? Let’s just dwell on the future.” <EOS>
<BOS> "If all they wanted was some silly tall tales, we wouldn't care. But it's more than that. Even our new history textbooks are vanishing..." <EOS>
<BOS> Vera smiles a bit when you approve of her idea so quickly. You try not to think about it too much, but you’re pretty certain that Vera is genuinely attracted to you and not just on a physical or “career” level. You don’t really want to ever think about it due to the whole fact that you’re cursed. Something you haven’t really had time to think about too much, but you need to fix it someday if you ever want to have any sort of relationship again. Maybe you could try to go see the Dornans about getting it lifted or something. <EOS>
<BOS> You find a tree that looks sturdy and high enough, so you climb it and prepare to sleep for the night. You just hope that anyone that might still be looking for you at this late hour doesn’t think to look up. <EOS>
<BOS> "Is there any other way to save memory? To bring you back? <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course. If there’s ever some big job or even small job that you want to pull off and need extra help with, I’ll be around.” <EOS>
<BOS> Well this is a bizarre outcome. You almost can’t believe it. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, I wish it was that interesting. But what I’m referring to is something a lot more mundane. Just a secret of my own I’ve been harboring and if we’re going to be together, I might as well come clean right now.” <EOS>
<BOS> As they make their arrangements and the mages finally let you go, Frogill crawls over to you and whispers the way to the secret tunnel - just past the hall of curtains, and down. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, nothing actually. Didn’t know there was another one of Vlad’s spawn running around. Wait, is this another one of his bastards, like you?” you ask with a smirk. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sheesh, what did that poor girl do to you now?” <EOS>
<BOS> The battle, if you can still call it that isn’t much of one. What made you such a vicious killer of Ebony Claw members, has also made you an equally vicious killer Guild members. Combined with the Ebony Claw backup, it’s no contest. <EOS>
<BOS> “The west side! The west!” <EOS>
<BOS> Best case scenario, you get taken in, tried and instead of executing you, they shove you in one of those cages where you first found Tom. <EOS>
<BOS> You nearly have no words… <EOS>
<BOS> Things between the two of you were always volatile, probably for the best that this ended now. You always thought it would Annah that would eventually leave though; you guess maybe she just needed a little extra shove. <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t really in any condition to run and there are enough of them that you don’t think you could fight them all. You don’t even have the advantage of your pistol any longer. <EOS>
<BOS> "What is this?" Captain Brost asks as the two of you crowd in. "You're supposed to keep the 'passengers' out of the way." <EOS>
<BOS> “Excuse me sir?” <EOS>
<BOS> You ask how much the taxes are which Dusk tells you and you find a little on the high side, but you’re able to do it. You actually give them the stipulation that you’re turning the temple into a new brothel (though they will still have their own living quarters) and you don’t want them preaching about Fel to any League members. You still don’t want your organization being mixed too much with religious fanaticism. <EOS>
<BOS> "No, but I heard what the headline is." You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not true! You could always choose to escape, I wouldn’t bet on your chances, but you can’t say you don’t have a choice. You also have a choice to give me information on the location of the Thieves’ Guild or not. I know for a fact you’ve long been a member of their inner circle so you should have lots of information on the layout along with the location.” <EOS>
<BOS> At least not unless there is some profitable reason for doing so. <EOS>
<BOS> You add the extra bit that the head of the Blue Dream addict was a Neroth cultist spy and explain that’s how come groups of Neroth cultists have been fucking up Ebony Claw interests as of late. <EOS>
<BOS> "Why the hell didn't either of you fucking idiots know any of this? And more importantly why didn't you stop the old bitch?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Five gold coins just to lead me through the forest? That’s fucking outrageous!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, I already know anyone who starts calling me friend as a greeting is probably the exact opposite.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, okay so when Tanya is brought back here, then what?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Though it makes you wonder… <EOS>
<BOS> As you leave Mr. Reynolds calls to you one more time about how you should go register as a citizen of Klyton soon. You get the strong impression that it wasn't a suggestion so much as it was an order. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thanks.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You look and see a woman in Dorna robes. It’s been awhile, but you recognize her immediately. It’s Heather. <EOS>
<BOS> Well that’s it. The struggle has been lost and you need to get the hell out of here somehow. <EOS>
<BOS> Not wasting any time, you rush towards Kassi picking up a scimitar from one of the savages. Solely focused on Kassi, you impale the closest invader from the back. The sudden rush of blood and fallen ally alert the others of your presence. Savages on either side of you swing their swords at your head almost simultaneously. Dedicated to your training, you instinctively bend your torso backwards. Two blades fly harmlessly overhead. Recovering upright, you slash one’s throat and gouge a deep cut through the other’s chest. Now that you’ve drawn the attention of the others, Kassi picks them apart one at at time. She’s only armed with a small dagger, and you realize she’s fighting as if unarmed, the dagger striking the killing blow. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well I was really thirsty, besides I still didn’t know some stranger was going to set me free. By the way, thanks a lot and nice work on that lock.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose that’s a valid point. However, it’s still a factor never the less. I mean just speaking on a professional level, I know I’m good, but I don’t know how good YOU are. I just know you were in the Bloody Talons and given what I knew of most of them doesn’t speak highly.” <EOS>
<BOS> Or at least you try to. <EOS>
<BOS> "Hey guys, I've been looking for you both. Rob just finished what will be the fighting arena location. You should see it!" Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, you drag us all here sayin’ it’s important and then don’t even show up on time for yer own meeting.” Another remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Don't have any. Get a job." You say still walking. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sheesh Vera, I didn’t know you hated hobs so much.” <EOS>
<BOS> Annah goes back to your side and holds your hand . <EOS>
<BOS> You take Kol and head back outside. You wonder where your people are since they’re nowhere to be found. Since you know that they know better than to just fuck off while they’re supposed to be helping you, you can only imagine one possibility… <EOS>
<BOS> “As you wish...my king.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, but you are finished,” Ragar the Unbroken cuts him off. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fair enough. Anyway I’ll be hand picking my own people for the attack along with still being there in person since it’ll be the only way I’ll feel comfortable that my orders are going to be carried out. We probably should look at a map of this area to go over the details better.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “It wasn’t! That’s not how I meant it! I just mean, if you’re allied with the Felians, then we’re going to eventually butt heads and I’d rather not have to fight you for practical and personal reasons.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Straight to the point. I can appreciate that. You want to get the how out of the way.” Flynt says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Form two!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Warts? I…mean I’d never rule anything out, but Warts really isn’t the leader type. I’m surprised he’s taken on as much responsibility as he has honestly.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What have you gotten ourselves into, kid?” Seth asks. "This is the same being that allied himself with the Empire and helped slaughter our friends." <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, guess let’s start strippin’ him. Huntin’ been a bit thin, so this is actually a bit of luck for us. Tell ya what, you can have what’s in his pockets and I’m just gonna keep da shooty and his body for eats, deal?” <EOS>
<BOS> Well you got a big decision to make based on your underlings recommendations because unfortunately for you, you haven't been lucky enough to fuck someone with engineering skills. <EOS>
<BOS> And of course she does it nearly instantly and you soon have a fire going. You’re getting incredibly angry and starting to regret letting her tag along now. You’re under enough pressure as it is and you can’t deal with her attitude right now. <EOS>
<BOS> “No! And I’m not just saying that because I don’t want that to be true. I’m saying that, because my real father from what my succubus bitch of a mother told me was some drunk dickhead that she killed immediately after mating with and because Reginald doesn’t know what the fuck he’s talking about. While he may have been sucking Neroth’s infernal cock in the spiritual sense, I still know more about the infernal realm more than he EVER could have and trust me, if he had known, he wouldn’t have been worshipping Neroth or whatever petty infernal warlord that’s setting himself up as a god to mortals at any given time.” <EOS>
<BOS> Your sister continues. <EOS>
<BOS> The month clearing out the ruined temple is a grueling process. It fortunately isn’t inhabited by anything worse than some over sized spiders and a shitload of qweepas. You mostly use the ex-Black Hooks to do a lot of the grunt work, even if they grumble a lot. Marco’s keeps the louder ones in line, but eventually even he has to complain when it turns out there are a lot of traps in the lower passages of the temple that have killed a few of them. <EOS>
<BOS> Through the eyes of the Unbroken, through your physical eyes, the world turns red, focused on a single target, the Emperor. The summoned weapons at your hands disappear as your body comes into a full sprint. Another supernatural leap takes you to the fortress’ walls. Like a four-legged beast, you climb on all fours, traversing the vertical wall. The Unbroken climbs with frightening speed, unnaturally, like a lion closing in on his prey. Another leap takes you atop the Emperor’s wyvern. Immediately, the Emperor summons a sword, similarly to the way the Unbroken did. <EOS>
<BOS> You and Vera duck into an alleyway and soon Vera is helping you out directly. <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno about that. You’ve at least killed Ebony Claw members, you haven’t even gotten a kind word from Tanya yet.” <EOS>
<BOS> "(Sigh) Damnit, why do you ALWAYS do this? Something gets taken care of and YOU always say something that suggests different and completely undermines morale?" <EOS>
<BOS> As it turns out, Heather’s imagination is a lot darker than yours. She manages to punish you for a week before she contacts the Syndicate about your double cross on them and hands you over. <EOS>
<BOS> Before you can answer with some sort of defiant reply, two of the red robed assholes holding you go down to throwing daggers in their faces from above! Of course this also means you fall to the floor as well since your leg is broken and you can’t stand. <EOS>
<BOS> “Forget the name for now, what we need to do is gather up everyone.” <EOS>
<BOS> Sneaks looks down and doesn’t answer. <EOS>
<BOS> No. You’ve spent your entire life building up a defense against the voice. The mental barriers you’ve built must remain strong. For the most part, you’ve kept it under control and surrendering now would make that all for nothing. It would be the easy way out. Instead of relying on your own resolve, on your practice, it would be cowardly to surrender now. You shake your head as a visible commitment to your decision. There’s no going back now. You must press on. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, I guess the night is still young. Might as well.” <EOS>
<BOS> You try to get some sleep, hoping there will be nothing as horrific as the night before. <EOS>
<BOS> “Actually I haven’t had any problem with any of them.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, good, then he’s not going to fuck with either of you directly through your dreams. Though honestly Fel is more of a voyeur most of the time anyway. It’s his minions that do all the heavy lifting so you’ll want to avoid them. In fact, I’d say you shouldn’t involve ANY Fel worshippers at all in this shit. They’d probably try to take your son away or something. Speaking of your son, now Fel MIGHT take more of a direct interest in him since he is linked to shadow magic, but again it’s mostly going be in the form of petty mind games of manipulation. Still, that might be concerning since he’s an impressionable child and all.” <EOS>
<BOS> Now free, you hurry along the way and find the quickest sewer entrance and enter. You figure you can move around down there with less hassle and get out of the city quicker. <EOS>
<BOS> Basically, it’s a case where the opportunity to expand is there, but once again Tom is failing to pull the trigger on it. You should be setting up another underground fighting pit, setting up gambling dens or even running a protection racket. Something needs to be done about Jake because the Crimson Talons can’t proceed if half of the members aren’t even Talons anymore and have declared allegiance to another leader. <EOS>
<BOS> The slug climbed the bush a ways and tried again. "Excuse me! Is this yours!" he shouted as loudly as he could. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re trying not to get frothing mad and think of a calm way to explain that now thanks to Annah, you definitely will have the Bloody Talons on your asses, Annah has moved on to taking your pack and emptying the contents on the bed and going through them. <EOS>
<BOS> The destination wasn't far, and soon the snake was moving leaves aside to uncover a glittering chest of jewels. The gods descended shortly after to see which animal had found their treasure. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because you know I prefer hard coin in my possession rather than anything else.” You reply trying not to lose count. <EOS>
<BOS> You crash to the ground, the tale fading, even though every word of it is true. You feel yourself dissolving into the soil, as if the Grove - no, something in the Grove, under it, through it - is taking your offering. And even as you vanish, understanding flows into you: the dreamless time will not be forever. Stories will not always fade. A new muse of dreams will be born soon, and the others will awake - perhaps in just a few decades, as your life-force will hasten their restoration. Even if the humans forget some important things, they will forge ahead and make new memories. Even if magic falters, they will find new paths through industry. And when Ivani wakes, someday, without you beside her in the world, she will take your soil back to the Dreaming Forest and plant an oak in your memory. <EOS>
<BOS> “What!” Kassi yells. “Fine, go ahead and leave us. You were never really one of us anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Uhn yeah, beat me harder! I like it like that!” <EOS>
<BOS> "Don't fucking like it, you can get the fuck out." <EOS>
<BOS> “Archers from the west. A small group judging by the amount of arrows fired. Some of the initial shots were flame-tipped,” Rexx answers turning back to business. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good, less for me to explain then. Thank you Camid, you may leave now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You’ll never replace her! NEVER!” you start to shout. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well who might that be? This island doesn’t exactly have a lot of priests or wizard types.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I am not royalty, and I have no desire to rule. I’m afraid your loyalty is to the wrong man.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes, I have for quite sometime. While I know you've been busy playing crime lord, not everyone spends all their life here at the headquarters. What I'm saying though is, with me as your wife, you won't look quite like the suspicious outsider, since despite you living here for years, you still aren't even officially a citizen of this city." <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes! Yes exactly!” <EOS>
<BOS> “THEY’RE GOING TO CATCH UP TO US! EVERYONE TO ARMS!” you hear someone shout and the carriage comes to a halt. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fool!” the Grandmaster shouts while maintaining the protective shield around the two. The medallion around his neck emits a bright white light. <EOS>
<BOS> And the Syndicate just complicates matters. How are they going to react or will they even care at all? Percy did mention the temple here was frowned upon by the faithful in Delantium. Maybe it wouldn’t matter if you wiped them out. <EOS>
<BOS> You fall to the ground a final time with a bloody hole in the side of your head. <EOS>
<BOS> This girl REALLY dislikes you to a point where you’re almost wondering if you did something to her personally or something. Then again you’ve had people try to kill you for less. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t say any more, but between the men holding you at bay with spears and a couple other searching your room, you fear the worst. One of them inevitably grabs the package you put under your bed. He then opens it and while you’re having a hard time seeing from your position, he pulls out some of its contents and holds up a vial with blue material inside it. <EOS>
<BOS> All this dwelling on you starting a new family makes you think about your pre-existing one and how they’re all doing. <EOS>
<BOS> You arrive with a few of the larger hobgoblins by your side. You weren’t sure at first, but letting some of Wart’s “buddies” from the Spiderfang tribe join was a good idea. They aren’t as big as an ogre or as muscular as an orc but they’re just as ugly and mean enough to intimidate most. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? You seriously can’t be saying there’s something wrong with the way I look! Oh shit, you’re not like Vaughn are you?” <EOS>
<BOS> Vera is silent for a moment <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, well you’re still leading the way.” The Watchman captain says. <EOS>
<BOS> "He's a dwarf and used to construct tunnel ways in the Cloudpeake Mountains. Fairly certain if we throw enough money at him, he'll be willing to oversee the construction of what we're doing. Besides, I can be pretty persuasive." <EOS>
<BOS> “Escaped? Nah, I just came out here to find you on my own. Don’t worry, I made sure nobody was following me.” <EOS>
<BOS> Honestly though, you’re ready to just dispense with the plan and do something else instead like try to kill Reginald. Those assholes have been targeting you anyway. Also seems like it would solve the problem a lot better than trying to be friends with him. Cutting off the head of a cult usually results in it falling apart. The problem of course is he isn’t as easy to get to anymore. The secret passage to his home no longer exists as one person in the Guild soon learned when he tried to break in that way thinking that it would be an easy job and nearly got himself killed in the process. If there’s another secret passage to the house, you have no idea where it is and it’s probably better protected now. <EOS>
<BOS> With the voices (and giggling) coming closer, you get desperate and pick up a nearby metal knick-knack of some sort and use it to break the window. You know you’ll be heard, but you’re hoping you’ll be quick enough to get out. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Annah walks up closer to you. She’s actually looking pretty good right now. The make up isn’t too much, but it’s definitely enough to make her look more seductive than she might normally. She smells nice too. Some sort of flowery perfume you guess. Living in luxury has its perks. <EOS>
<BOS> On your way out, you’re stopped by Zalmora and Vaughn. <EOS>
<BOS> As for the battle outside, it’s winding down with your side winning, but you’ve suffered more than few losses. Still, could have been worse. <EOS>
<BOS> You spin around and see Vera. <EOS>
<BOS> “Alright fine, I’ll go and one of you can relay the message that I need to see him.” <EOS>
<BOS> "There are more around guns nowadays you know. Don't need to be a good fighter to just shoot someone. I acquired one myself soon after I bought the inn." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> After a quick check to see if anyone is in the area, you get out of your bloody clothes and change into some new ones. You might not be properly clean, but it’s better than you were. <EOS>
<BOS> “Is that right? Well, you looking for some company then?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I said he’s nice, not a pussy. There have been a few who have tried over the years, mostly before the EC established a greater presence, but the man isn’t unskilled in the ways of defending himself. Besides the Thieves Guild isn’t the Ebony Claw and because Garrick is so fucking nice, people generally like him enough that they’d rather keep him as head of the organization. Not to mention we don’t exactly have the most ambitious bunch in the Guild. Most of the really ruthless, kill their own mother types to get ahead join the EC. We’re not Joachimites, but I’d still wager that most of us in the Guild have just a few more scruples than the average EC member.” <EOS>
<BOS> Another has a broken tooth you must pull. <EOS>
<BOS> You spin around and see five men dressed for battle. They don’t look like Holgard Watch either. You nearly go for your pistol and that’s when you realize you don’t have it anymore. The only weapon you currently have on you is a dagger still in its sheath and you’re not likely to succeed a confrontation in your condition. <EOS>
<BOS> Why risk getting lost or paying this greedy greenskin when you can just force him to lead you out of this forest? <EOS>
<BOS> “Maybe, but I prefer that we also save a little of our coin because, who knows when we might need it for a bribe or to get the hell out of Klyton one day.” <EOS>
<BOS> (It also occurs to you how it’s weird how everyone’s been getting religious on you lately) <EOS>
<BOS> "...You like this girl don't you?" You ask causing Camid to look away a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> “You realize you’re killing yourself right? And I don’t mean starting a war with the Syndicate, because you aren’t going to live to see that anyway. Even with your advantage and weak anti-magic ring, I…WE have more than enough power and skill to overcome what’s just in this room. True, we probably won’t survive, but we’ll do enough damage to this entire place that when our absence is noticed, the Syndicate WILL assume the worst and send people to mop up what’s left. Terrible way to do business.” Percy says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay. That’s good. What about my offer?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Like nothing I’ve ever heard before. Just keep at it.” You say with a smile. <EOS>
<BOS> After spitting a bit of blood and rubbing your head a bit, you slowly get back up and that’s when you hear quiet sobbing. <EOS>
<BOS> A branching oak, with broad and shady leaves, where the children of the village can sit. There, they will listen to her spin new tales, tales that will never vanish. <EOS>
<BOS> Dark energy materializes at your hands as the Unbroken tosses your sword aside, letting it clang harmlessly on the courtyard floor. Dark purple flames extend from your palms, solidifying, becoming translucent weapons, an axe in one hand and a sword in the other. With a supernatural leap, the Unbroken is whirlwind of shadowy sword and axe. The otherworldly weapons tear into Imperial soldiers' armor with ease. Each kill entices the Unbroken to greater heights of zeal, cutting down the Empire with vigor and thirst. <EOS>
<BOS> The crowd claps, and you give a slight bow before passing the hats. The children begin a game of looking for treasure around the Oasis, and Trasila looks amused. By the end of the night, you are 250 silver richer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Didn’t her place get destroyed during the flood? Even if it didn’t I’m not sure what some witch could do if Fel cursed our son.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I got six shots here, maybe I’m not making it out of here alive, but six of you are going down with me, and YOU are definitely first.” You say and then you feel a familiar object shoved in your back. The rest of the EC members back away from you at this point. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well then our people come screaming out of it and start wreaking havoc in the city.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Better deal than I got from this asshole.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’ve only had the fortune of working with Tanya a couple times before and that was always in a group and she of course always limited her contact with you in those cases. <EOS>
<BOS> “HOW FUCKING DARE YOU QUESTION MY IDEAS! I’m the one in control here! YOU follow MY lead! YOU are only allowed the magnificence of my presence because I allow it and you should be grateful!” Tanya bellows and her voice seems to invade your very mind a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> You nearly laugh at how matter a factly Tanya says this. <EOS>
<BOS> A slow chuckle emanates from underneath the hood. As you wish. <EOS>
<BOS> “I guess so.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> Your vision is blurry, you feel dizzy, your head is in pain and ringing and the rest of your body isn’t doing much better since you fell pretty hard and twisted your ankle. To top it all off there is a skirmish going on around you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good. I suggest you rest up before night. You’ll need all of your strength, especially you, Seth. Those wounds have barely healed.” <EOS>
<BOS> Percy’s remark catching you off guard. <EOS>
<BOS> “Annah, if you’re so unhappy and dissatisfied with me, then why are you still around? I mean I’m not twisting your arm and holding you here.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well we do run an entire island, seems perfectly reasonable to declare ourselves the rulers of it.” Vera says. <EOS>
<BOS> The squirrels each took a shiny gem, chittering as they hopped back to their dens. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay…well not really interested in such things anyway. And while your offer is interesting, I’m still not convinced going up against the Jicol navy is a good use of my time. You still haven’t given an amount you intend to pay me and while plunder is nice, Jicol isn’t exactly the most booming trading port anymore. They’re having their own economy issues and stealing from poor cities that can put up a good fight isn’t exactly profitable.” <EOS>
<BOS> Form two! Strength pours from your limbs. Your muscles are strong, built up from practicing each morning. It doesn’t feel stale; it never bores you. The practice flows through you as you flow through the practice. You become one with the forms. They push your body to greater levels, and you gladly welcome the challenge. <EOS>
<BOS> “But I have concerns about our future intimacy, if I’m going to nearly be killing you every time.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I fucking wonder why, get the hell out of my way disease bag!” <EOS>
<BOS> Without any more fanfare you leave the Crimson Talon headquarters wondering where to go. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? Is what you got under those clothes so impressive that you think I just won’t be able to contain myself? Or perhaps you’re just shy?” <EOS>
<BOS> You look over to your left and see Garrick’s face mashed into bloody mush. Not being able to find anything to help your wound, Tanya attempts to lift you up, but you tell her to stop. <EOS>
<BOS> "So how is it running the old family business? Being married and generally being an average working class citizen?" <EOS>
<BOS> After Ivani, the others are east to destroy. Willow, Mizaria, Sage, Vrolik - each, in turn, reduced to a cloud of colored particles. <EOS>
<BOS> “Now that’s what I like to hear. A woman that plans in advance.” <EOS>
<BOS> “We’ve been a little pre-occupied as of late. Defending the faith of Fel is a tireless cause, but one we take very seriously.” <EOS>
<BOS> You nearly have to stop yourself from laughing. <EOS>
<BOS> "And little time. I fear the mages will destroy us, soon, once they find a way." <EOS>
<BOS> "Mr. Palmer! Welcome!" he greets, grabbing hold of your thin hands with his sweaty ones. "Dressed for a journey, I see!" <EOS>
<BOS> “Sure you are.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Good, good,” the wizard Kragan replies, “and I will help you, as I have helped your village in the past. I will provide you with what you need to succeed – for a token service fee of course.” <EOS>
<BOS> Seeing as there isn’t anything else in here, you return to the wine room where you unsurprisingly see Warts drinking. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, Garrick told me to talk to you if I changed my mind.” <EOS>
<BOS> There you see an old man in robes. He looks very much like what you’d think a wizard would look like, or in his case priest-wizard. Heather wastes no time in telling him (and everyone else) that you’ve been marked by a succubus and also how you want help against the Joachimites. <EOS>
<BOS> Going to be one of those nights… <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose I will be bidding you goodbye and off to defend your distasteful slave market, apparently Rook wants the best of us there. Pity, you seem fairly more interesting now that you’re still alive. I can only imagine what story you must have told Rook for him to believe you as well killing one of his top advisors. Very impressive.” <EOS>
<BOS> When you get back to Vera she asks what the hell happened since you were gone so long. She nearly called the rest of the League to go attack the Black Hooks. You explain everything. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, what’s this you were going for? (Whistle) Shit, never seen one like this before and I ain’t seen many. Dumbass kid, shoulda used this to begin with. Bet you’ll never make that mistake again.” The bandit says then drives his sword in your throat. <EOS>
<BOS> “I could tell just by how you speak and act. You speak the language like you only just learned it. You’re obviously not a native Galpatian. Where are you from originally?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah well things are different now and YOU don’t tell us what to do anymore!” Marco exclaims. <EOS>
<BOS> Heather goes on to say that she will of course smooth all this over with Ludmilla and more importantly make sure there are no repercussions for the League. <EOS>
<BOS> Year 35 <EOS>
<BOS> “Shit…” <EOS>
<BOS> "Why is that so crazy?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Too bad. That was your best chance.” He says and lunges. <EOS>
<BOS> Again, this crown got you into this mess; you might as well keep it at this point. You tuck the crown away in your pack hoping that it stops speaking to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Thank you for that. This was a much easier course of action rather than potentially having to deal with you later down the road.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Apologies Heather, but…well fuck, these two pissed me off and I didn’t have time for their bullshit.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point you start laughing. <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s the king’s emissary,” she replies. “You don’t know about the emissary?” <EOS>
<BOS> When you actually enter the Poison Blade, everyone immediately looks at you. <EOS>
<BOS> Even Jenny’s boyfriend is shocked when you’re choking on your own blood when you hit the floor and die soon afterwards. <EOS>
<BOS> “…okay…Yes, you’ve got many talents. I mean it’s why we work so well together. You distract folks with your charm and I do the rest. I’ve always known that and I get that you’ve always liked the attention you get from the marks more than the actual thievery. But I thought you said you were seeking a more stable future. Being a wandering bard doesn’t exactly qualify.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well I figured if they ever learned the truth they would waste no time in getting their revenge.” <EOS>
<BOS> A bit later, Balen decides he's gone far enough, and the two of you dismount. You thank him and he nods, heading back with the two horses. It is doubtful your paths will ever cross again, but it is sure that without him, you would have been handed over to the mages. <EOS>
<BOS> You start nodding. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, however I was also told that you were meeting with the head of the wizard school here and I figured that would be your first priority of your trip.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “…if I was…and I’m not saying that I am. What business is it of yours?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “What? No and Elder Flynn isn’t going to want those things either. In fact, just put those away.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Help? No I don’t think so. I work alone.” <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re questioning the idea that this is even a good idea, the fact remains is that in Annah’s strange way she is here for you right now. In fact, she’s possibly the ONLY person on your side right now. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, and you're still not a citizen of Klyton. And after the divorce, I guess we'll see who ends up with what, and if you think I won't drag you through the mud and make this hell for you, then you haven't learned very much during our time together." <EOS>
<BOS> “Probably not me, but someone will. Probably of much lesser importance of course. I was just here this time to extend the hand and make the deal as it were. Still glad we came to one.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I suppose. I do hope you know that this isn't going to be as easy as you believe though. Good thing we've got a lot saved up, because if we're going totally legit, we're probably going to be taking a major loss for awhile." <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course I do, why would you doubt that?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well, follow me. I shall inform the Grandmaster of your intrusion. No doubt, he will reprimand you for your actions. I am no guardian of knowledge. I exist to further it.” <EOS>
<BOS> Of course NOW Virgil decides to be uncooperative. <EOS>
<BOS> You limp away and eventually find your way out of the park. (Or what you assume was a park anyway) <EOS>
<BOS> Not long after you conclude your last remaining business in Jicol, an explosion is heard followed by a loud rumble. Sounds like it’s coming from the direction you just came from. <EOS>
<BOS> “Saved our asses? I repeat, you nearly got us fucking killed! And on top of that, I had to prevent you from getting your hand chopped off because you were trying to grab shit before checking for traps!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well? Did you take care of that business?” Zalmora asks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Rotten timing for you," the other guard agrees. "Look at Miss Lina's gift, here -" he points to the woman whose gift he is turning over in his hands. It's an ornate golden hairpin, with the decorated end a floral design in tiny rice pearls, rubies, and jade. Strands of jewels and pearls dangle from it, just to drive the point home. Your brooch can't compete. <EOS>
<BOS> “He goes by the name Olaf. He’s actually an ex-Talon associate but after the fight pits closed down he went back to working as a leg breaker for Mr. Reynolds full time. You familiar with that man?” Tom asks. <EOS>
<BOS> A few hours pass as you wander the ship a bit and generally stand around doing nothing. You sort of thought someone would order you to do some work or earn your keep, but that hasn't happened yet. You almost feel like you're a passenger rather than a proper crew member. Not that you're complaining. <EOS>
<BOS> "What exactly happened anyway?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Heather suddenly starts to dig her nails into your arms and is actively holding you down. It’s enough for you to try to resist, but somehow she’s a lot stronger than she appears. Not to mention she is putting all her weight on you and got you in locked in quite securely with her lower body. In fact it almost feels like she’s crushing you. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course, you do have a pretty good set up here. If you took more of a hand in cleaning it up a bit, you might be able to continue to go unnoticed. It would be like owning your own inn without having to actually run it. <EOS>
<BOS> Once you’ve lost the zombies, you stop a moment to catch your breath. You realize that you need to get to Kragan Firehand’s tower on Dagger Hill now. Maybe he can tell you who did this and if there’s a way to undo this terrible curse on your village… <EOS>
<BOS> What was left to try? Rom headed out to a tree near Malong field to take his lunch break and think. He watched two old men playing Emperor's Circle under a shady tree at the edge of the great field, their laughter carrying on a light breeze. <EOS>
<BOS> “Didn’t she also try to convince you that siding with Peter would be a good idea and that you should go talk with him? That was actually the first bait, which you obviously didn’t take. The original plan was to try to kill you while aboard the ship. Second plan was when you retreated to Jicol, she would have killed you there, but as usual you’ve got the luck of Yag constantly with you. I sometimes think maybe that’s who I should have picked as a deity instead. I might not be all fucked up now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Go back to bed, girl. I’ll handle Brother Trevor in the morning,” Samuel quietly speaks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you serious?” <EOS>
<BOS> Your goal is to get the hell out and as far as possible from this damn city because there really isn’t anything holding you here now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Who is it?” Vera asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “My plan?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Suppose I shouldn’t expected any less from ya. Youz haz a death wish. Always haz fightin’ dangerous groups of cutthroats, goin’ head ta head with religious fanatics, fucking demon bitches… youz gonna get yerself killed one day and it ain’t gonna be a pretty death when it happens. But guess I gotta respect all dat. I hope Yag’s still usin’ loaded dice, cuz yer gonna need ‘em.” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> You make your way through the hallways, fighting off soldiers whenever they come near. Though you are well younger, the soldiers fight with little technique. Their swords moves as if through water. You stick to your training and finish most with a single counter. A slight redirection of their sword leaves them vulnerable to the killing blow. You do not hesitate, even though it is your first time in real combat. You do as you are trained. <EOS>
<BOS> “Again, as I said, I want someone in charge around here. I certainly can’t entrust it all to Warts can I?” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s enough to make you freeze up, but you maintain a cool head and don’t panic. <EOS>
<BOS> You feebly throw a punch with your one good hand, but again you don’t connect very well and only manage to his Jake’s side. Meanwhile Jake punches your two more times in the face nearly knocking you out completely and certainly knocking out several teeth. <EOS>
<BOS> It suddenly occurs to you that you’ve never really tried the university district of the city. Might be worth a look, after all it should be filled with stupid rich kids not aware of their surroundings and the Talons don’t seem to go running around there, so there might be less heat. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well maybe his new family man role is urging the halfbreed to start thinking about his future. Maybe his ugly hob bitch is nagging him to earn more for their equally foul hob spawn.” <EOS>
<BOS> “But getting back to my point Tom doesn’t really want to be bothered to change things too much because as I said, he lacks the ambition to be a true leader. Still, he seems to like you since you rescued him from that cage and you generally don’t give him grief, so maybe there’s a chance. Come on, I let you into this temple I call a body, you can at least let me into that head of yours a bit.” <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya knocks the pistol from his hand and easily subdues him while you grab your weapon off the floor. He struggles for a bit, but then eventually just stops and starts crying. <EOS>
<BOS> Darkness. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah…nice. (snort)” the merc says with a slight grin. The other merc chuckles a bit as well and you follow the pair of them back. <EOS>
<BOS> In the meantime you need to calm your son (and Layla) down. <EOS>
<BOS> “…hmmm…y’know I never considered that. Oh well. It isn’t like she’s my only child. My boy Henry starting to show a lot of promise. Can’t wait for him to take over the business someday.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Quite right," Kelsam nods. "Perhaps our guest has something to do with it?" <EOS>
<BOS> “You were pissed at me? For what?! I thought we got along really well!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Bullshit! That’s ALL you ever think about. I know you do. You can’t even help yourself. Pfft, your earlier lie about not being interested me anymore when we were on the rooftop before all this happened was laughable. I know for a fact that you regularly have sex with some whore that tries to look like me. In fact isn’t she the same one you saved? Boy you must LOVE that. It’s almost like you can pretend that you saved me like some hero.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Hope I know what the hell I’m doing.” You mutter to yourself before turning your attention to Layla who is still sitting quietly and wondering what you’re going to do next. <EOS>
<BOS> “No. I don’t partake. I need a clear head to run this place.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> While you’re pondering all this, Percy finishes up his drink. <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well, you’ve made your point. Let it be known though if something goes wrong and we both survive it, I’m going to kill you.” Shade says. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re safe now, child,” he whispers to you. <EOS>
<BOS> “Anything to undamine doze arrogant tree fuckers. Um, youz gonna need mercs? Cuz, Spiderfang tribe haz got da numbas again an’ dey know the area ya know.” Warts says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes dear, you keep telling yourself that…so are we going to Klyton now?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I seek knowledge on shades,” Brother Samuel answers. “Knowledge that even the lowliest necromancer would have.” <EOS>
<BOS> Through the cold night, you rinse the bandages a few times and mop his fevered brow. You aren't sure if what you have done for him will make much of a difference, but he is still alive, and that's something. His ragged breath eventually evens out into something a little more like regular sleep. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hold on! I’m no bandit! I’m just a traveller a bit down on his luck. I know this road is dangerous, I was just wondering maybe if I could travel with you guys, you’re going to Holgard right?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh. Just tell them to come to the Blackheart Inn, where I’m currently staying by the weekend. That should give you enough time to scout the streets, taverns, and wherever else. Oh and let them know that the drinks will be on me, so that should help entice them as well.” <EOS>
<BOS> And then again. <EOS>
<BOS> You die just before Tanya drops you back to the floor again. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hm, well I’m certainly going to be asking her some questions.” Zal says. <EOS>
<BOS> In any case it’s a ways there, so you get on with it. <EOS>
<BOS> Well in for a copper in for a trove. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera looks at you with a smile. <EOS>
<BOS> “By fucking Yag’s loaded dice. That one’s Ellis! He ran the slave market!” one says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not stopping you though is it? Come on, just choke me a little, I can take it.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Fuck. Looks like Warts was right. Yag’s crapped out.” You say to yourself, drawing your blade for a final stand. <EOS>
<BOS> You still aren’t exactly sure about the Dornans, but you’re willing to give Heather the benefit of the doubt that she has genuine intentions. This still could all backfire of course, but you’ll have to take that chance too. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, you’d be lying to yourself if you weren’t going to miss her. She kept an eye on details and things organized. Now you’re going to have to do all that shit yourself, because while Vaughn isn’t incompetent, he’s no Zal. <EOS>
<BOS> “Of course not, but I trust the fact that I know how to lay it down good enough that he told me all this stuff in the bedroom without me even asking.” <EOS>
<BOS> “You ever think she’s skimmin’?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh yeah…well it is! Look humie, ya gotta take big risks in dis profession. I don’t doubt yer skilled. You’ve lasted longer than most independently in dis city. But I’m tellin ya, there’s more out there that yer missin. I mean, sure it’s foolish ta go head to head against da ECS, but robbin some rich asshole that may or may not be a wizard? Well dat’s different.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wha? Why is that your go to action with me?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> HE’S HERE <EOS>
<BOS> “Wow, I can’t imagine why.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Nothing, you’re the boss.” She says. <EOS>
<BOS> The next day is fairly mundane until you notice that the woods is beginning to thin out. If you continue walking the way you are going, you’re going to be in the open fields. and if you’re going to march across the open plains, you might as well just walk on the road since you’ll be just as exposed. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point the one speaking to you spits on your boots and gets in your face. Several more members close in on you at this point. This could get really ugly. <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t making it to the exit and even if you did, you still have to make it out the front gates, and through the streets of the city before you get home. Your “condition” isn’t going allow you to get that far, you need to isolate yourself NOW. <EOS>
<BOS> “I trust you know who I am.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you sure?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose we did…though I don’t believe this is going to impact you as much as it will me. My bond with you is only supposed to be temporary so I can access you better at which point I should be draining your life force and eating your soul, or whatever it is I’m supposed to do. I can’t very well go around being a proper succubus if I’m monogamous.” <EOS>
<BOS> As Annah grabs your arm while you walk to Jasmine’s shop, you continue to think about leaving here. The only thing is, are you going to do it like your sister did and just leave in the middle of the night, or are you going to actually say goodbye first? <EOS>
<BOS> “Why? Wait a minute, you don’t have a crush on the Baroness do you? I mean you were praising her pretty hard a moment ago.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Nah, he’s no wizard, he’s just got some magic powers. Prolly just rumors anyway. Sides, should be easiest stealin’ from one lone man, than one who has a shitload of guards right?” <EOS>
<BOS> Still, you’re getting a lot of leeway all things considered. For now you’re going to accept. You can always figure something out later. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sounds like a true love story. Anyway, what did you want? Are you here to buy or something?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Warts…are you crying?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> As a result of your actions, you get a discount, which you take full advantage of. You leave the brothel feeling like robbing that cultist’s house wasn’t a bad thing after all. You even entertain the idea that Yag has blessed you a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> “Me? Nothing I guess, but I suppose I remember the first time I did some time in a prison. I was younger than you and it was a lesser offense, but it still wasn’t a pleasant experience and I know I would’ve been glad for any help I could have gotten.” <EOS>
<BOS> Gwen attempts to put up some sort of magic protection, but Tanya picks her up with ease and smashes her into the wall several times like a rag doll. There is no scream, just the flopping about of a bloody broken body. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, brilliant idea. Since when the hell did we become a bunch of unsophisticated bandits?” Vera remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> "Hmm," the captian grunts. <EOS>
<BOS> You certainly hope your meeting with Peter goes better. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora chuckles a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> Without another word, fake Tanya approaches you and you waste no time spinning her around, lifting her cloak up, and doing her on all fours, mainly because it’s easier to immerse yourself if you aren’t looking at her face which might work from a distance, but isn’t going work very well if you’re staring full on at her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hold on a minute.” Warts says and finishes off one of the mugs that wasn’t quite empty yet. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah, yes she is pretty firm when she wants her way. I can imagine you probably tried your best to talk to her. I suppose Hessla’s bad reputation is a bit exaggerated anyway and I’m sure she’ll be fine and I’ll see her in a few days. At least you brought back the qweepas and that was the most important thing.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, as shocking as it is. All my stuff is actually still here, even my cut. Glad to see I’m somewhat respected around here.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Nah, it'll be fine." <EOS>
<BOS> “I suppose, but…” <EOS>
<BOS> “Aren’t they some really ugly oversized rats?” <EOS>
<BOS> This accusation causes you to step back a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> As you drift off to sleep, your thoughts go to your sister. <EOS>
<BOS> For a while it looks like you might survive all this and not even have to fight after all. <EOS>
<BOS> In a few days you get a message delivered to you from the ECS. It says that someone will meet you at the Blood Bandit in another week. You get the impression you know who that’s going to be. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fake?” you say in a completely surprised tone, though not completely put on since you didn’t think someone like Warts would know. <EOS>
<BOS> You grab Zal's hand and squeeze a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora smiles a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> You probably would be able to evade your pursuers if not for the fact that your hands are shackled behind you and you don’t know your way around the city. That’s very apparent, when you find that you’ve just run around in a circle and surrounded by soldiers. <EOS>
<BOS> You empty your pistol into Percy’s back as he’s walking towards the door. The few tavern patrons run for cover and every shot hits him. <EOS>
<BOS> You aren’t quite sure how to play this so you decide to go with your immediate thoughts. <EOS>
<BOS> “I don’t know. Am I? I thought I was merely asking a question.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes," he flushes slightly, "only a handful of mages are born with the starsight in a hundred years. But I'm only a Journeyman. I am on my way to Stone City to enroll in the Academy for further training." <EOS>
<BOS> “Mm. Well I wouldn’t want to assume that you’re going to be fine just because you’ve severely beaten the odds. You’re still marked and who knows what that could do if it ever really kicked in. However, we can purge that from you. If we did you probably wouldn’t feel as bad and a great weight would be lifted.” <EOS>
<BOS> You clear your throat. “If you enjoyed the tale, please spare a coin for my journey.” You pull out a worn blue hat from your pack and begin to walk with it around the group. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, you’re stepping down as head of Crimson Talons. You’re no longer fit to lead.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “And I take it you’re not on good terms with them either.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Well there’s also the ongoing smell of the sewers that puts people off.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sounds like you’re talking about building a city.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Wait a minute. I know you. Shit, thought you died in Holgard.” Zamed says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Guess again. Hahahahahahaha! (hic) So can ya spare a copper?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Something exotic!" he requests, "and full of adventure!" <EOS>
<BOS> “I have to say, I’m wondering what this is all about, you don’t usually speak with me like Vera has in the past. How is she anyway? Last time I saw her she looked pretty fit. Glad to see having a child did not ruin her figure.” Zamed says obviously trying to prod you. <EOS>
<BOS> “I know we just look like delinquent ragamuffins to you, but we’re just young and lacking options. We’re just simple folks in the scheme of things and we can’t help how we appear right now or how we feel about each other. Yes, we don’t have much money, but my beloved is skilled in the blacksmithing trade. He’s even willing to work as a dung sweeper if he can’t get an apprenticeship and I fully intend on trying to get work as a waitress.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not sure what to tell you Zal, I mean we’re fucking criminals doing illegal shit. This is sort of way things are done.” <EOS>
<BOS> Coming out of the woods across the river from your village, you are horrified to see it burned to the ground! Blackened ashes remain where buildings once stood and the carcasses of dead animals lay scatter across a ruined field directly ahead of you. <EOS>
<BOS> “We travelling through those fields?” <EOS>
<BOS> You shake your head and go get Vera. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well if you hadn’t noticed. I’m not just a wanted criminal for being the ex-leader of the JRC, but also for causing severe destruction to Jicol. Was a little difficult raising the coin to bribe my way onto a merchant ship since I knew you probably had all your pirate and smuggler buddies on the look out for me. Even trying to sneak aboard a ship was impossible. Maybe if I had been younger…fucking old age.” <EOS>
<BOS> You look around to see where Tanya might be, but again its possible she already went inside. You bet she went in from the rooftop. Every time you’ve worked with her, she’s always favoring the rooftops. <EOS>
<BOS> “I didn’t do anything! Where’s dad?!” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point Flynt pulls out a fist sized wrapped bundle and pushes it towards you. He then pulls out twenty gold coins and puts them right next to the bundle. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s just me and you here, just relax and ignore everything else except me, I’m your whole world right now.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Now who’s being forward?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “You still really think our organization split up on the outside and inside the city is the best solution?” <EOS>
<BOS> “And it’s not even over yet.” Dusk says. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re going to have to do a better job at explaining if you want me to believe you.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Then could there be a connection? I'm not saying the muses are behind it, I'm not sure I can believe that, but still - if magic and memory have only come under assault now that there are less stories being told in the world, doesn't it stand to reason that whatever is taking the dreams and stories can also take from other sources?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Ohh, I see. Looks like you got a lot of younger ones…how are they so tame?” Gossey asks putting her finger near one which just sniffs at it. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, but he’s called Yag where I come from.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I have to agree with Zal on this. We don’t know much about her other than Camid’s praises.” Vaughn adds. <EOS>
<BOS> “Good, that’s the proper way to feel.” <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s been a fact even before they closed their gates and tightened their security. Last gasp of a frightened government that knows its days are numbered. I mean it hasn’t even fought anyone is quite sometime, how ready are they really without ongoing conflict to keep the skills sharp? You and I both know if you want to stay at the top of your field, you have to practice.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh shit…” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Funny you should bring that up since I heard an interesting story about all that recently.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I certainly hope so since I shot them all in the head to make sure.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Appropriate name. Was wondering when one of you lot would show up.” You say, lowering your weapon. <EOS>
<BOS> The fact is, you did have a relationship with her and to some small degree you did care. <EOS>
<BOS> Heather just acknowledges the obvious and tells you to follow her. She seems to be trying to maintain a certain detachment about all this. You can honestly say if you were her, you certainly wouldn’t be doing it, then again you’ve never had that much dedication to a deity either which seems to be her main motivation and perhaps intimidation by Flynn. <EOS>
<BOS> "Sit," he orders, and you do so, sinking into a cushioned chair and trying not to sigh at the softness. "You're a nosy passenger." <EOS>
<BOS> Before you can respond, the pimply man suddenly points a finger at you and zaps you in the chest with a lightning bolt! Well lighting bolt isn’t exactly the right word, since you aren’t exactly knocked on your ass, but it is a tiny jolt that catches off guard and it did hurt. <EOS>
<BOS> “You’re seriously asking me that? Don’t forget who taught you everything you know,” she says confidently. <EOS>
<BOS> “Okay, so are we not keeping a presence at all here?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes. Obviously you’re still going to have to kill Reginald and whatever fanatics he has in the house with him, but the Holgard Watch? They can always change loyalties and those that can’t, well they’ll be dealt with. Consider this another favor from your friends at the Ebony Claw.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Was that him? He ran right past me screaming.” Tanya asks. <EOS>
<BOS> With those last words all of you march towards the temple. The few wanderers still outside in the area immediately go find shelter when they see a group of mean looking hobgoblins and Felians walking down the street. <EOS>
<BOS> “Your son? When the hell did you have a kid?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “I know you will kid, you’ve always been a good earner. Looks like Yag really blessed me when you I met you in that cage that night. Good thing the rest of that lot out there were late after all.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well this is a one time thing. So where’s Vera again?” <EOS>
<BOS> A loud shot is heard, but it isn’t from your pistol. It’s from the musket of a Holgard watchman who overheard all the noise and came running. In typical Holgard Watch fashion he shot first and didn’t even bother asking questions. <EOS>
<BOS> You scout stores and shops, avoiding the tourist traps and checking out the antique stores and pawn shops. Finally, you settle on a curiosity shop which is having an inventory clearance sale and appears to have many fine items marked down as suspiciously low prices. You pick over everything carefully, trying to find something you think will appease her sensibilities but also fit your limited budget. By the end of an hour, you've collected four items from the shop you think will suffice and have laid them out on the front counter to examine. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m literally going to speak to a bunch of people that practically eat, sleep and shit magic. If they decide to kill me, there is little anyone else in the League is going to be able to do to help so there’s really no point in anyone else getting potentially disintegrated. That’s probably not going to happen, but in case shit does go south and I don’t come back, I guess it’ll be up to you lead this organization.” <EOS>
<BOS> Warts and you leave the inn and after looking around a bit and scratching his head he beckons you to follow him. He walking just fine, so maybe he isn’t that bad off. <EOS>
<BOS> "Okay, but won't you have already wasted time and money with this Rob if he turns out to be a failure?" <EOS>
<BOS> You watch a little dumbfounded. Partially still recovering from being sick and what you’re witnessing. Vera’s cries and pleads for you to help her, but there isn’t much you’d be able to do anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> The capital city lies in the distance. Today, you will burn it to the ground. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t worry about your whore getting crushed because I’m gonna crush your fuckin’ skull…AGH!” Klint shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh I already told her about the big gathering tomorrow. I told her I’d meet her here and as far as she knows I’m just staying at my boyfriend’s place tonight, which isn’t a lie. Oh shit. I forgot my key to the house to give you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Are Vera and Kol safe!?” you say starting to get up. <EOS>
<BOS> You then look over at the bed. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, and make sure the qweepa specimens get here alive. Those are very important to my research. My assistant will have everything else required for this job and the trip will essentially be completely paid for.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I told you that rescuing that whore would catch up to you.” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> It isn’t until night that you finally get back to which Vera is relieved to see you both. Kol actually fell asleep on the journey. <EOS>
<BOS> You stand in the closet listening to Jenny and whoever the guy is and hear them get closer, though eventually their voices trail off in a different direction and given what they’re laughing and talking about, it sounds like they’re heading towards Jenny’s bedroom, which is a relief to you. <EOS>
<BOS> You have two of your hobgoblin muscle show Percy a large chest of gold to which he nods and you tell them to load it on the carriage outside. <EOS>
<BOS> "I feel - " she pushes herself to sitting and reads the letter. She places it down in her lap, the last bits of gray rippling away. "I feel," she says again, then scrinches her brow. "I feel." <EOS>
<BOS> “And here’s the coin, hope you’ll accept a sapphire.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad it turned out well then. Tell me all about it. But first, things have been busy here and I think Marco and the rest of his immediate crew wanted to see you tomorrow to ask about building their own ship or something. Says he’s got an idea that will make us bunch of coin. Who knows though. I’ve also got some slavers coming in so I’ll be busy as well tomorrow.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What would I object to, I’m no racist.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Best ones usually are, I've found." Your sister responds. <EOS>
<BOS> "His name's Carl and you probably have seen him, you just didn't know his name. He's a short grubby guy. His face almost looks a little orcish, but he smells worse than one half the time." Vaughn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well, after the day I had, I really wasn’t expecting it to end with a pretty woman asking me to take my clothes off. I’m half expecting you to turn into a monster of some sort which would be more in line with my luck lately.” <EOS>
<BOS> Things go very slowly, but initially at least people aren’t getting themselves killed. Trouble comes when you actually come up against the remnants of the JCR who have made several cubbyholes and the like to launch ambush attacks. Not to mention you’re practically waist deep in water now and as far as the Jicol Watch is concerned, there is no sign of them. Apparently they’ve all just decided to stay up top and let you take the beating. <EOS>
<BOS> But the next thing she does is even more unexpected. <EOS>
<BOS> While you still aren’t sure what happened to Vera, you write a letter to her, informing her of the situation. Telling her that she’s in charge of the Nocturnal League now or whatever she wants to call it as you have moved on. You also tell her you’d like to meet with her in person if possible since you believe you still need to hammer out some details. <EOS>
<BOS> “No. I thought we’re not allowed to have relations.” <EOS>
<BOS> “We’re in our new house! Do you like the room? If not, we can always change it up for you.” <EOS>
<BOS> "And you? It's strange to see an old man crossing the sea unless he must, even on a luxury liner like this." <EOS>
<BOS> Part of you wants to just head to the Raggedy Man Inn to confront this person once and for all, but all of this sounds so damn suspicious that you can’t imagine going there would do you any good other than getting caught in a trap. <EOS>
<BOS> “We should be close now,” Seth comments from the head of the group. You travel single file through the forest, guided by directions from the tribal member. There are twenty of you (give or take), dressed in varying colors from previous allegiances. The company of freedom fighters doesn’t have the well-coordinated march or attire of Imperial soldiers, save for the few that defected, but when it comes to battle coordination, there are few that can stand with you. It’s not hours of drilling that guides you, it’s battle-hardened soldiers with the instinct for war. Those that joined the company lacking the instinct didn’t stay long. Anyone who wanted to oppose the Empire could join, only ones with an aptitude for combat stayed. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes Grand Matriarch, perfect just like you said.” <EOS>
<BOS> And you are not quick enough as two shots go right into your back causing you to fall but somehow you miraculously manage to shift your weight so you don’t completely crush Kol in the process, though he’s definitely under you and not happy about it because he’s crying quite loudly. You almost want to join him given how much pain you’re currently in. <EOS>
<BOS> You realize the scenery below is different. Instead of the battlefield below, the wyvern’s flight has taken you far from the capital city and towards the Moon Bluffs. Blue water stretches as far as you can see. Green-tipped cliffs overshadow the liquid body like a tall tree on a sunny day. Waves crash against the rocky slope in small explosions of white foam. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, she insisted on staying in Hessla.” <EOS>
<BOS> Kol was apparently afraid to tell you or Vera this since he thought you’d both be angry, but he opened up to Layla since she seemed nice. Meanwhile your mind is racing on how to handle all this. <EOS>
<BOS> A piercing screech projects from the summoned spirit echoing throughout the room. The intensity grows with the ray’s brightness. Suddenly, the spirit collapses. The screech, now silent, leaves behind a soft ringing in Samuel’s ears. <EOS>
<BOS> "I seek an audience with the Empress," you say. <EOS>
<BOS> As for you, you’re of the mind that you need to find a suitable headquarters. You suppose you could just “take over” the current inn you’re living at. It wouldn’t take much to intimidate the owner, though your bigger concern is visibility. Gone are the days where organizations like the ECS could just sit out in the open and the Watch would turn a blind eye. You’d have to be more careful to keep up the appearance of legitimacy. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you sure the place is going to be packed anyway? I mean you did just kill Garrick, surely someone has found his body by now. People might be a bit suspicious and not wish to hang around.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Take a break, if you want!" the commander laughed, "you already did your part. I'll even give you a medal." <EOS>
<BOS> Scully was either wrong about mermaids not being in northern waters or you're more off course than you thought. Either way it doesn't matter because you're being assaulted by them and you're shoving wax in your ears. <EOS>
<BOS> "Interesting. But how do you know so much about him?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> You enter the inn, which is fairly empty. An older woman sweeps the floor, while an older man stands behind a bar. You see a couple of people sitting at tables, but none of them really pay much attention to you. <EOS>
<BOS> The Unbroken wills your flight path downward, and you feel your feet touch the ground. <EOS>
<BOS> The link broken, you gaze at her dulling form, her hair falling heavily over her eyes and losing its color. "No!" you shout. "Don't leave me! Tell me how to save you." <EOS>
<BOS> As you’re doing this, you’ve moved far enough away from your dropped light source that you can’t even see what’s around you clearly. In your thrashing you’ve stumbled down a corridor you didn’t explore and specifically into a larger gathering of spiderwebs. <EOS>
<BOS> “No. I mean I’m hardly in a position to judge on any moral grounds and I don’t even give a shit about the extra coin you’re making. It’s just…I dunno. Slavery is just one of those things I feel…icky about. Don’t ask me why.” <EOS>
<BOS> The rest of the caravan ride passes with relative ease, minus a sunburn which took a few days to heal, and you even make a bit more coins drumming up rare shades of red like cerise and carmine, and telling stories to your caravan mates. Even if your legs are sore, it's an enjoyable way to travel. You check with the caravan master, and he assures you that if you should ever come back this way, you'll be welcome in the Imperial Caravan. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re not taking the fall for some assholes you’re not even connected with, you didn’t even know about Blue Dream OR the Ebony Claw Syndicate until today! <EOS>
<BOS> “Not that it concerns you, but yes I did. Now let’s move on to other things.” You reply. <EOS>
<BOS> “No, nothing like that. Just need you to crack open Jenny’s safe.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh, is that right? And who is? You?” <EOS>
<BOS> With as much rest as you’re going to get under these conditions, you and the wizards are soon on your way to the palace. <EOS>
<BOS> “I followed you obviously, but let’s talk about that later, we need to get the fuck outta here!” <EOS>
<BOS> The shout rings through his canvas tent like a bucket of cold water. A hulking, tanned man enters through the tent flaps. Captain Wren sighs knowing full-well he’s needed elsewhere. Rexxus wouldn’t barge in otherwise. <EOS>
<BOS> “Don’t worry, you won’t win.” You say and hand your pistol over to one of your people. <EOS>
<BOS> “Because if anything happens I want to make sure someone competent is still in charge of the League. I trust Zamed will be fine in taking just me correct?” <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe you'd get more out of these raids if you were of the rapey nature, but curse your parents for raising you to at least adhere to some sort of moral standard. Though some of them seem content on buggering each other. (And no matter how long you've been at sea, you can honestly say there's nothing that would even make you THINK about sticking it to any of this loathsome lot you're with!) <EOS>
<BOS> And so you finally explain to Vera starting at the beginning when you first met Tanya. You tell her about your odd relationship with the demon girl you fell in love with. Vera never interrupts much except to say that Warts did tell her about Tanya very briefly once, but not in too much detail since he never paid much attention to your love life. Vera seems genuinely fascinated by it all. She’s even sympathetic. You suppose in some ways your obsession with Tanya mirrors her obsession with you a bit. (Though obviously in a vastly different way) <EOS>
<BOS> Though Tom was pissed at you and knew he had to kick your ass, he never had any intention on killing you. All of his blows against you were normal kicks and punches. Never once does he say, pull out a dagger and stab you in the face with it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Nothing personal? Not sure if I believe that given that you’re pointing a pistol at me.” <EOS>
<BOS> Your body once again falls back to the ground in pain causing you to shout out. Though the pain now is only in your upper body since the lower half has gone numb, you can’t even move your legs. Your son cries nearby and you don’t think you’re surviving this one. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’ll be here.” You remark. <EOS>
<BOS> You look on in slight awe as you see Tanya draw her sword, which is now on fire and Heather just barely blocking it from cleaving her in two by casting a magic shield. <EOS>
<BOS> You also see Henry, or at least you assume it's Henry. He hasn't changed much since the last time you saw him, though he's sporting a few scars across his face now. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, see what that got me. Still, I'm glad to see that you have some sort of morality. Maybe there's still hope for you. Remember it's never too late to turn your soul over to Joachim." Wendy says. <EOS>
<BOS> As the clerk asks you the first basic questions, you notice that he's studying you. At first you chalk this up to him being suspicious, but when you mention you wish to buy the inn because your family once owned it and you'd like to rebuild it again, he suddenly speaks out with a bit of a smile. <EOS>
<BOS> You both roll down it gaining speed and eventually even separating from each other. You fortunately manage to grab on to some bushes growing along the slope. Ardan however keeps rolling and that’s when you see that the slope doesn’t stop on flat ground, but instead what looks to be a long drop over a cliff. <EOS>
<BOS> “Silence wizard! I will deal with YOU later. If my former…human wishes to speak with me, then he will do so until our business is done. Now then, before we move on to this curse you speak of, I wish to ask more questions about you, one of which is why have you not moved on from me? I asked you to do so.” Tanya says. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, it’s almost like you aren’t completely yourself. Part of you feels like you’ve done something like this before, and that you always tried to stop it, but couldn’t. There is a brief moment of clarity and then only overwhelming guilt followed by rage. <EOS>
<BOS> “So I heard. I gotta admit, when I first met you, I thought you might go far in this profession…but I didn’t see you quite as ruthless as all this. I mean maybe you aren’t ECS, but you’re sure copying their rulebook. What exactly did we DO to you anyway? Weren’t we always good to you in the Guild? I mean I know Garrick was an asshole to you about Tanya but was betrayal really necessary? Couldn’t you just let her go?” <EOS>
<BOS> "I still plan to go to the Grove of Muses," you say. <EOS>
<BOS> "Regina! I knew you'd come back to me! I'm coming darling!" You suddenly hear a voice shout which fortunately breaks your concentration. <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well. What did you have concerns with exactly?” <EOS>
<BOS> “Nice try shithead. Now obviously since you tried to fucking lie to us, you HAVE been working on our turf. However, hand over what’s in your pack now and you and your stupid bitch MIGHT walk away unscathed.” The talkative one says. <EOS>
<BOS> You never knew that Vera is REALLY into this whole slave trade business. Though you suppose given that she worked as one for so long, it makes sense she wants to stick with it. You’re not going to hold it against her, but you’ve definitely realized that you’ve still got some scruples, scant though they may be. <EOS>
<BOS> You can only imagine how concerned Vera is right now. Hell, she might have even declared war on the Black Hooks believing them to have killed you, but there isn’t much you can do about that at the moment. <EOS>
<BOS> “Did you want these now?” you ask shoving the leather pouch at her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Are you ok, Kass?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “But what about Fel?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I should have known that you had connections everywhere, but I couldn’t scrounge a damn living in the half drowned remnants of Jicol anymore. So I took a risk and got captured by a opportunistic merchant rather than a pirate or slaver, the result is the same I suppose.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Because...um...I make sure she doesn't actually get Yellow Devil. I mean she does, but it's a VERY small amount. Almost nothing. The rest of it is cut severely with various common shit I get from the apothecary. She feels good for a little while and feels rebellious and she doesn't get really hurt." <EOS>
<BOS> Vera starts to speak and then stops. <EOS>
<BOS> You dream. <EOS>
<BOS> “Sorry friend, but we can’t just let anyone in this fine city. Well not before checking you first.” The guard says with a smirk. <EOS>
<BOS> “Lost? What were you doing here in the first place?” <EOS>
<BOS> You fire the remainder of your shots and from the sound of things you probably hit at least a couple people. The problem is you can’t be sure who so you take this opportunity to head towards the nearest exit and at least get to a better lit area. <EOS>
<BOS> “Pfft, I’ve been sneakin’ around, nicking stuff long before youz was even thought about! You try growin up as a half breed in a mostly hostile tribe. I had ta steal to survive sometimes! Sides I could carry more stuff for ya! Also, if ya getz inta trouble I could help. Like last time!” <EOS>
<BOS> "You're right, it couldn't be worse than this. Come back, I forgive you." You suddenly hear a voice say that sounds exactly like Zalmora. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey kid, you need help with that?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?!” Heather remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re barely awake before you’re rushed by several men dressed in chainmail. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re not really concerned though since you’re still capable of taking care of yourself and three of your people have offered to come with you, which seems wise just in case the desperate think about messing with you. Even the Jicol Watch isn’t going to hassle you when they got people killing each other over qweepa meat. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s gotta be taken care of and besides, maybe I’ll just be charming enough to convince Scales to join us again.” <EOS>
<BOS> "I'm willing to take that risk." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Afterwards Madeline attempts to cuddle with you and all that other stuff that goes along with having a “proper” girlfriend, but you tell her that while you’d love to spend all day just being naked with her, you both have important shit to do and you have to get back to it. <EOS>
<BOS> “Tanya, stop. You’re not going to get me to an infirmary or the apothecary in time.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “So you keep telling me. Look I think you know I’m just as nervous for other reasons being out here, but I’m trying to stay calm because…well you’re with me and I know you’ll protect me.” <EOS>
<BOS> “I should certainly hope so, these are the quarters of some of my own crew. As a favor to Vera, I have allowed you to bring aboard your…greenskins and provided comfortable accommodations. I certainly hope your savages don’t get sick all over my ship.” <EOS>
<BOS> And so begins your life in Klyton... <EOS>
<BOS> You can’t believe you’re even in this situation, let alone acting the way you are. Still, you suppose it makes for an interesting change. <EOS>
<BOS> The point is, you always at least had a way to deal with magical threats. <EOS>
<BOS> “VERA WHAT THE FUCK!? THAT FUCKING HURT!” you exclaim holding your ear. <EOS>
<BOS> Currently, you’re seeing everything from above. Almost like you’re flying over the city, but you’re not actually there. The only thing that is certain is that you’re still holding the crown in your hand. <EOS>
<BOS> “And you’re going to do that?” <EOS>
<BOS> "Well," the woman with glasses says, "they did seem to like you, so no harm done." <EOS>
<BOS> “That was years ago and they didn’t even see me do it!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Sooo, where you from son?” Flynt asks. <EOS>
<BOS> “On time as usual. Very glad that you value promptness as I am in a bit of a hurry. I believe I may have had too much fun here and I should be getting back. I thank you for your suggestions on where to go.” Percy says. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hey Bruno, Yinen didn’t come in here by any chance did?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “When are they supposed to arrive again?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, Klyton is the only place you really have any basic knowledge about thanks to your parents both being originally from there. Your father never really spoke too much about it, just saying that the only thing worthwhile that he got there was your mother and he was glad when they finally moved to Teckleville to be closer to your grandmother at the time. <EOS>
<BOS> “Isn’t this a school? Where is everyone?” <EOS>
<BOS> “I dunno about that, I’d say they’re probably struggling like everyone else currently. If they were truly stronger in presence they’d be directly attacking us and some of our hangouts more often.” <EOS>
<BOS> The first thing you do is start opening your safes and hauling out the most precious valuables along with a good stack of gold coins. <EOS>
<BOS> So far they haven’t even contacted you, though you imagine when they do it’s probably going to be in the form of several shadow magic trained assassins. If they’re feeling benevolent, they’ll try to intimidate you first into paying them a cut of your profits and then get rid of you later. <EOS>
<BOS> Zalmora looks at nearby group betting and getting excited over a giant roach race. <EOS>
<BOS> "Why are you helping me?" you ask. "Aren't you a merchant?" <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, well let’s hope that’s enough for him not to kill us.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re on the spot and now you suddenly don’t feel very sure about this plan, but you’re here now so you better be convincing. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, thankfully Gloom was a trusting fool and practically a heretic of his own faith which generally goes about things in a much subtler manner.” You answer. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hello again! I was hoping to catch you before you left! And by your appearance, it looks like you had quite the experience last night! Hope it was fun for you!” Ludmilla says. <EOS>
<BOS> At this point you hear an explosion outside the new headquarter’s entrance. It isn’t a big one, but it’s enough to cause a rumbling and the ceiling of starts to fall to pieces. Vaughn, Zal and the other two Talons instantly run back to the entrance only to find that’s its collapsed and soon so will the rest of this place. <EOS>
<BOS> “Indeed. You’re already responsible for the demise of the Thieves’ Guild, an ECS chapter, the Joachimites and the Felians.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Very well, let’s get this over with.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Keep your sorcery away. I can manage on my own,” Seth says. <EOS>
<BOS> Your agent says that they were interested in based on the sealed letter you had her deliver to them. However it would require you to take a trip to Klyton. A bit unusual for you considering you haven’t left Holgard in…well since you got here nearly twenty years ago. <EOS>
<BOS> My strength grows. Not only the power within, the one Lorthander created, but our military might grows as well. I’ve never witnessed anything like it, the closest would be the holy sigils inscribed on some of the monks’ weapons. It’s like the feeling of running and never getting tired. There’s a point when you sprint towards a target when you reach your quickest speed. It does not last long as exhaustion takes over. The energy pool I rely on is inexhaustible. The monks taught me to move with frightening speed, to have instinct and reaction times far greater than the average man. Now when I think on their abilities, they were truly the average ones. <EOS>
<BOS> While the cultists cushion your fall down the stairs, it doesn’t do much on improving your situation overall. There are enough of them that after the fall to the bottom, you’re immediately nabbed, beaten and stripped. And not just your of your weapons, you’re stripped of your all your clothing and throw you into one of the cells that you rescued that girl. They’re even less pleased when they learn that you released her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah, I see. You feel your skills are a waste if not practiced. I can identify with that.” <EOS>
<BOS> “And I told you I don’t have it to spare! Look, I’m going, maybe the next person will be more generous.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “You don’t have to understand. Stick to your training, and it will guide you through. Now go! We must defend the monastery.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh relax. I know you aren’t really going to fuck her! She’s a slave after all not royalty like me. She is very pretty though and the image of fucking her is probably going to pass through your mind. I’ll be expecting you to lay it down really good tonight.” <EOS>
<BOS> what you got to do to survive it. <EOS>
<BOS> “It’s fine. I just don’t like losing. Especially to the outlaw,” she answers. <EOS>
<BOS> “So… Tom I appreciate the offer, but I think I’m going to stay on my own.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t even bother knocking on the door, you just enter and that’s when you see Vera who turns around from her mirror to face you. She does indeed look a lot different than you’re used to seeing her. <EOS>
<BOS> “Probably not. I even told Garrick as much when he first approached me about the plan earlier. At best Reginald might temporarily ally in an effort to separate me from the rest of the Guild and probably attempt to convince me to join them and embrace my heritage or some shit. I don’t even like…my condition. Last thing I want to do is embrace it. Already had to deal with that once before, don’t feel like dealing with it again.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Not just memory," he sits in the corner and peels a purple fruit. "The Water Arcanum is also faltering. There has been much discussion about it among the mages." <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah. And as you know, Tom has never been fond of me. So I would be more of a detriment. Just go in and talk to him, you did fine last time remember?” Zalmora says nudging into you a bit. <EOS>
<BOS> The next day you board the trader ship and make your way to the cargo hold which contains mostly spices and cloth material that you’d have no interest in stealing anyway. <EOS>
<BOS> Because you sure have a lot of it. <EOS>
<BOS> “From the stories Sneaks has told me, you’ve put so much fear in would be suitors that they’re too scared to make any advances on you. Just because they’re not being obvious about it, doesn’t mean the desire isn’t there.” <EOS>
<BOS> "All right," you say. "I'll tell you a short one." <EOS>
<BOS> “You do? Can you teach me?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> With a lynch mob starting to form, you do the only thing you can and that’s run. <EOS>
<BOS> You look over to the emergency rowboat and you realize you could probably get to it a lot quicker by yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> "But, the muses," Lorvan protests. <EOS>
<BOS> “It was different I can say that much. Have you seen Vera?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> "No," you shake your head, "I am a follower of the One God, myself. Not a good one, I'm afraid. I tend to neglect matters of devotion. My wife once tended to all of that, before she passed..." you trail off, Technically, it's true - Ivani passed somewhere, even if not to the afterlife. But you'd rather not bunk with a blood priestess, and so you need to win his sympathies. <EOS>
<BOS> “Oh about a couple days.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What?!” <EOS>
<BOS> “Best ones usually are.” Your sister responds. <EOS>
<BOS> Vera looks a bit moved by your words. Honestly, you didn’t really plan to say something like that, but it felt right under the circumstances. Vera nods and agrees with your words and then moves in to hug you which you return. <EOS>
<BOS> You head back to the Lighthouse where you once again don’t find Tanya. When you bed down for the night however, she finds you in your dreams which now are a lot more vivid of her. <EOS>
<BOS> “You know I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t important,” Brother Samuel replies. <EOS>
<BOS> “Hah, yes. Yes she was.” <EOS>
<BOS> You’re out for who knows how long, but by the time you wake up it’s dark and the sounds of battle have died down though your hearing still isn’t very good and your head is throbbing. <EOS>
<BOS> "I think there's your answer." Mr. Reynolds says. <EOS>
<BOS> You forgot all about Gwen who out of everyone here is innocent in all this. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah I did. Several times in fact, but there were just too many coincidences for me to not come to the conclusion I did. Not to mention I still think about Tanya from time to time. I mean it’s certainly not as strong as it once was, but she’s still there. And if she’s still in my head, what else was left behind?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, that’s fine. Just get me the value in bullets and a pistol cleaning kit.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> With today’s crisis averted, everyone soon goes back to their routines, though you take the rest of day off to spend time with your family. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe you’ve just longed for intimacy for so long, maybe it’s the drugged drinks enhancing the pleasure to an unnatural degree, maybe it’s the anonymity, maybe this girl is actually a magical fairy with a magical vagina, or maybe it’s a combination of several factors. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yes, I'm aware, but have you really thought about WHY that is? Why you have to go on these rampages every few months or so?" <EOS>
<BOS> You continue to not respond and just walk past the Shadow Blade. <EOS>
<BOS> The passage is behind a large portrait in a cellar, and small palmstones sit in the entrance. Somehow, it is like the staff conveys their purpose to you: orange for light and warmth, blue for fresh water, purple for levitation, yellow for food. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wargh! blag! Graaah!” it shouts causing Warts to turn around. <EOS>
<BOS> “Her mother? I thought her mother was dead.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Doesn’t even look like that asshole.” You say and toss it in a nearby bin. <EOS>
<BOS> Despite this impediment, you manage to get rid of the last of the qweepas, and fortunately for you, there doesn’t seem to be any more qweepas attacking you. <EOS>
<BOS> Garrick dumps the coins in front of you, which you immediately inspect. They’re real and a lot more than what you were expecting to get for your trouble. Garrick’s friend turns her head a bit towards him, but doesn’t say anything. You get the impression she doesn’t approve. <EOS>
<BOS> “Still got it, old man,” he whispers to himself. <EOS>
<BOS> “Since I brought you in, I knew you were not destined to live a solitary life. I never did tell you about the night I found you.” <EOS>
<BOS> You crack the safe and indeed find quite a bit of coin in the safe. You find a couple of small objects that may or may not be valuable though. Seems like Annah thought there was more in there than there actually was, still, it’s not a bust by any means. <EOS>
<BOS> “Glad to hear you say that Heather, because I will need your assistance in this ritual.” Flynn remarks. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, all other criminal activity in the city is mostly by independents and unorganized.” <EOS>
<BOS> Well there’s a couple ways you could go if you did decide to take over Jicol, though maybe the best solution is to just leave it be. <EOS>
<BOS> You briefly flirt with the idea of stealing something from this place, but common sense soon wins out. Last thing you want to do is even risk pissing off the Baroness, especially since you’re on good terms with her. Still, sometimes you miss the days of when you just stole things for a living. <EOS>
<BOS> “What?!” <EOS>
<BOS> "So wait, you're gonna just fucking come in and take over completely? You get the fucking tavern and all the fucking money? What the fuck do we get?" Annie asks. <EOS>
<BOS> The strange thing in all this is now you're glad you told Zalmora to leave when you did. You hope she managed to evade capture. You think she probably had enough time to run before the militia converged on the place. <EOS>
<BOS> And while he could also be lying about that as well you’re confident in your abilities that if he tries anything, you’ll be able to defend yourself if necessary. At worst he’s probably going to just run off. <EOS>
<BOS> “You heard me! I get absolutely no fucking support from the directors when I need it the most. You claim we don’t have enough money to send back when we should damn well have a surplus! At this point I’m less inclined to trust YOU than I am him.” <EOS>
<BOS> It’s apparent that Vera’s desire for you to go to Jicol is more than just pragmatic reasons. The girl is obviously carrying feelings for you. Always has most likely. If things were different, you might be more inclined to jump at the chance, but this fucking curse is sort of preventing you from such a thing, but that’s not really your immediate concern right now. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yes, who was that?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> "Of course not," you shake your head, trying to recover his trust, "I was simply thinking that 200 would be a more fair price." <EOS>
<BOS> And that intensified quickly. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya chuckles at your remark. <EOS>
<BOS> “Not really. I mean I still need some time to get ready for the trip and I imagine even with your meager belongings you might not want to just suddenly jump on a carriage. Also, this weekend is still going to be the best time to go rob Jenny’s safe since she’s going to be home the rest of the week. I can also convince her to come with me here to enjoy the show. So while I’m here with her, you can go clean out her safe and take a few other items as well.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Guess I got an appointment with city hall or something...is that where I go?" You ask. <EOS>
<BOS> "Best not say that!" she whispers harshly. "They've shut it off on account of the riot. 'Protection,' they claim, but we all know what it's really about. Power." The woman bundles you back towards your room when one of the mages glances your way. "You might still be able to get through once you land - take a horse through the forest, don't stop at any cities. They might not be guarding the back way to the Grove." <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, ever since dey got their asses kicked hard by da elves and lost a good portion of the tribe, there’s been sum serious re-thinkin’ on how things are gonna work now. Anyway, just wunderin’ if they can join.” <EOS>
<BOS> “By the gods! What have you done!? What have you DONE?!” your mother shouts. <EOS>
<BOS> You’re silent. You can’t think of anyway to lie or stall. It’s either betray the Guild or die. You feel the crossbow still in your back, Rook inspects you as you struggle with the morality of this decision. <EOS>
<BOS> “I want you to come with me.” She says. <EOS>
<BOS> "Yep, it's your sister from the same mister! Well don't just stand there wiping glasses, give me a hug!" Your sister responds. <EOS>
<BOS> “It won’t be you? A pity, well I’ll be looking forward to the day when we can do a job together.” You respond. <EOS>
<BOS> "I was, but that was a different time under different circumstances. I mean can it hurt to even inquire?" <EOS>
<BOS> You are halfway to the tower when suddenly a little yellow creature hops up unto a nearby rock. <EOS>
<BOS> "I don't think you realize the position YOU'RE in." You warn. <EOS>
<BOS> “So, Seth, can the raid be successful?” King Aeric asks through an ale-filled beard. <EOS>
<BOS> Percy stands up, shakes your hand and leaves. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not your fucking secretary. You want to know, you need to pay, ten silvers.” <EOS>
<BOS> "Fair enough," he stands to scan the bill and pay the waitress. (You ask to leave the tip - it's only polite.) "All right. I'll take you to the passage. <EOS>
<BOS> Still, it isn’t like either of your parents are pleased with your recreational criminal activities and have tried to steer you in a different direction with little success. While it tends to go in one ear and out the other with you, sometimes your sister listens occasionally. <EOS>
<BOS> Since you have no words for that story, you just silently continue to follow. <EOS>
<BOS> “What’s this for?” you ask. <EOS>
<BOS> “And you’re in the infernal realm.” <EOS>
<BOS> “He actually is, just not in the way you think. He thinks an all out gang war would be a mistake due to them having the numbers. He might be right, I don’t know. But all that shit we steal and the Guild gets a cut of? That doesn’t all just go towards equipment and extra casks of booze for the headquarters. Some of that money goes towards more important things like bribes, paying off the Watch and getting a few underpaid bean counters on our side to muddle paper work on occasion.” <EOS>
<BOS> However, she seems to perk up quite a bit when she goes through your lay out plans. She starts changing your original plan quite a bit, but she’s respectful the entire time and explains why for everything. <EOS>
<BOS> In fact you’re starting to have a greater appreciation for your parents as well at this point. How many times did you avoid real trouble thanks to your father’s influence? <EOS>
<BOS> "Lady Vanya." <EOS>
<BOS> You’re having such a good time reminiscing that you almost forget that you’re probably talking to someone who betrayed you. However, it’s always still in the back of your mind and you haven’t forgotten. You suppose as much as you want to find out, you’re trying to enjoy “what once was” while you still can. <EOS>
<BOS> "That's a silly question Zal. We can always use more income and taverns provide the best cover." <EOS>
<BOS> "Yeah, but she's really fucking smart. Top of her class or some shit. I don't even understand what she's talking about half the time. Of course I'm just staring at her tits most of the time anyway.” <EOS>
<BOS> “What? Why?” you respond. <EOS>
<BOS> “Ah, a customer! Well don’t just stand there looking at my employees, come forward and let me see what I can do for you.” A voice calls out from across the room. <EOS>
<BOS> Meanwhile Rook is just shaking his head as he tosses one of the books aside. <EOS>
<BOS> You begin to tell Zalmora about your concerns with how things are done regarding robberies. There is little finesse, nobody sticks to a plan and it’s more outright thuggery. You go on to mention that it might not be as much of a problem if you weren’t in a city fanatical about curbing crime, but since you are, this is kind of a big problem in the long term. <EOS>
<BOS> “Well let’s just say I was keeping my options open based on which way you were going.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “I’m not sleeping in a fucking tree! I’m hungry, and it’s getting cold! We should build a fire!” <EOS>
<BOS> “You wouldn’t be baby sitting me! I know how to fight, its just safety in numbers. I mean if we run into any trouble I’ll even help. I’m not asking to get paid either.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Be careful, I love you!” Annah beams while lying naked on the bed. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, I dunno, the guy’s head is all fucked up. They really did something to him, I dunno if he’s going to be the same.” You say. <EOS>
<BOS> “Fucking hell, I came here to rob some shit, not take a tour of a slaughterhouse.” You say to yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> “Wargh! blag! Graaah!” it shouts causing Warts to turn around. <EOS>
<BOS> "I appreciate the input Vaughn, but I believe a more permanent solution is needed here." You say. <EOS>
<BOS> Later that night when Kol goes to bed, you and Vera both speak with him and say generally positive things to him. You also go on about the plan and to remember that no matter what Fel says, he will never love Kol as much as you and Vera will. <EOS>
<BOS> “Um, I get the impression your wife doesn’t like me already.” Your sister says. <EOS>
<BOS> "I can only imagine what he took as proof, but what the hell, I did pay for all this." <EOS>
<BOS> Holgard comes to mind, but there's always some sort of rebellion or power struggle going on there. You'd rather not have to deal with being in the middle of that mess. The Delantium Kingdom is at war with some other nation, so you'd rather avoid the possibility of suddenly getting press ganged or conscripted into military service. <EOS>
<BOS> You don’t think you’ve ever talked too much to Amanda before, but today that’s going to change. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe you just need to get back to basics and walk away from it all. <EOS>
<BOS> She of course immediately notices this and for a split second she probably considers breaking or stabbing your hand, but instead she just pulls her hand away and then steps back from the table altogether. <EOS>
<BOS> As far as you know you aren’t in any immediate danger, but then right now you’re seeing a vision and you don’t know what’s going on in the “real world.” For all you know you could be surrounded by guards. <EOS>
<BOS> Pulling out your outdated map, you consider the route you will need to take north across the continent of Redsand to reach the ferry in Disbrook. There are two caravan routes marked in faded ink: one that leads from what is labeled as the Tower of the Dragon Emperor, now the Tower of the Wyrm Empress, and passes through the Salt Village Oasis on its way to Disbrook. The other departs from Scalebrook itself, and it's main stop is the desert town of Mandi. <EOS>
<BOS> Henry slowly walks over to the desk still never taking his eyes off you the whole time. He then takes his knife and stabs it into the desk as hard as he can. This action causes you to step back a bit and you prepare to draw your own weapon until Mr. Reynolds calms everyone down. <EOS>
<BOS> However, being an ally is a two way street and Heather did say she would help you in any way she could. <EOS>
<BOS> “What did you mean then?” <EOS>
<BOS> Elder Flynn does a similar thing with his hands that you saw Heather do and he comes to the same conclusion. <EOS>
<BOS> Tanya quenches that desire when she brings her fangs down on your throat and rips it out. The mercy of a quick death was perhaps her last gift to you. <EOS>
<BOS> You succeed and he drops his axe. When you go to pick it up however, Ardan just decides to tackle you, however the pair of you are near a slope and as a result, both of you go tumbling down a steep hill. <EOS>
<BOS> “Look, I got my own problems right now and I can’t be taking on someone else’s, so I’m saying goodbye to you.” <EOS>
<BOS> “Eh, fine. Better disarm this…ARGH!” one of the thugs shouts as you jam your dagger into his leg up to the hilt. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately that’s because even most qweepas know better than to go near the spider webs. <EOS>
<BOS> “Didn’t you say you saw a structure outside the city, in the jungle?” <EOS>
<BOS> “No kidding. That’s all I’ve smelled since I’ve been here. Hate it. I wouldn’t even be here if I wasn’t trying to find cheap talent for the inn I’m currently living at. What’re you doing here? And where’s that little hell hound of yours?” you say. <EOS>
<BOS> You immediately head back to the large set of stairs that lead up in the foyer. As you’re heading up the stairs, you notice that the lighting is becoming much darker. It’s almost as if the candles from the chandelier are going out. <EOS>
<BOS> "So little?" you say. <EOS>
<BOS> Before you know it, you see Zamed and some of his people along with the trader. You aren’t sure how this is going to go, but you’re ready to pull your pistol. You just wish it was multiple shots like your old one. <EOS>
<BOS> “Join you?! I see you’ve been drinking too!” one laughs. <EOS>
<BOS> He begs you to stop killing him, but you’ve snapped. He’s caused you nothing but trouble for your sister and yourself. You’re ending it today and with one more strike, you thrust your dagger in his throat and then pull it out. <EOS>
<BOS> As soon as you’re in the public area of the city again, you realize now you’ve got another problem. Instead of having a strong sexual desire around a bunch of other people who are also suffering the same condition, you’re now potentially around a bunch of people who aren’t suffering it at all. <EOS>
<BOS> “And as you like to point out, he might not listen.” <EOS>
<BOS> The man is taken aback. <EOS>
<BOS> Willow shimmers with color, like fall leaves reflected on a rippling pond, and holds out her hands. "Then, come, join me in sorrow. Turn your grief into life, your despair into hope." <EOS>
<BOS> The melodic voices continue to pierce your brain and then you feel the weirdest pleasurable sensation below. <EOS>
<BOS> “Yeah, and I could also die a year from now. You going to blame that on a so called curse as well? Shit happens. And that’s exactly what happened to those girls. I mean none of the ones you told me about were exactly in the safest of positions. Whores, tavern wenches, one was another thief. I mean it’s a cruel world and living in Holgard doesn’t make it any easier. Just because they happened to die shortly after you fucked them, doesn’t mean your dick is cursed.” <EOS>
<BOS> “That’s good…that’s good….so hey instead of water, how about you set me free?” <EOS>
